It's time for you to go.
Excuse me, but you have to leave now. I need to lock up.
Sorry. I have things to do. You'll have to leave now.
If you don't mind, I have things to do. Would you leave now, please?
I need you to leave now.
I need you to leave so I can lock up.
You need to go now.
[Gasp!] Oh my goodness. Excuse me, are you all right? I... By the Divines, this person's dead!
May you rest in peace.
Hmm. Body's still warm. Looks like there's a killer about.
Tsk. Such terrible times we live in. Is no place safe anymore?
What? What's going on? By the light, this man is dead! Brothers! Sisters! There is a killer among us! Find him! Bring him to justice!
Akatosh bless you and keep you.
Watch out!
Stay away!
Look out!
No. That's not it.
A new scent is here. Who can it be?
It is hidden away. Yes. No one will find it....
Stick the wickwheat until soft, add the marshwillow...
Oviparous. Ovovivparous. What's the difference? We are born and we die.
Small fork on outside, or is it inside....
So much to remember.
So strange this place. Far from the marsh.
So clumsy, all my fault.
Do I drop the sweetroll or hand it over and come back later? Dunno....
The blue plates are nice, but the brown ones seem to last longer.
So many bottles to collect.
I shouldn't have pushed so hard.
That guy asks way too many questions.
What was I thinking?
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt. Everywhere dirt.
Who put that there?
Wood Elves. Why? What's the point?
Perhaps a trip back to Morrowind would do me some good.
Talking to yourself is not a sign of mental illness. It's not.
I can't read them all. They make no sense.
I could use a guar. Hell on my boots, though.
There is someone watching me. I can tell.
The indignity of it all.
If that creature visits again, I think I'll have choice words to say.
First the vision. Then the conjuration. This is unsettling.
Clearly he was wrong. Yet I do think he meant well.
Such useless creatures.
I don't recall using teleportation, and yet there I was. Alone. Naked.
It just stood there, holding its tail and whispering. What did it say?
The sun and moons transform day to night, but what transforms the mind?
These Dunmer are useless.

Work, work, work. Keeps my hands busy.
Goblins and rats. Seems like they're everywhere. I'm just waiting for the giant spiders to show up.
It's good to get up and move about a bit.
I think I need something to drink.
I heard him tell the joke. I understood it. It just wasn't funny.
All I needed was that right pauldron, and my set would have been complete.
Thirty-six. That's pretty impressive, actually.
There's just no use to it.
Everyone is talking, but no one has anything to say.
I'm so hungry I could eat a Bosmer.
I'd kill for a sweetroll right now.
Brandy and comberry wine. Not a good combination.
So many things do do. So little time.
Guess I won't be visiting Kvatch.
Strange.
I don't know if I like this.
That was the strangest book I've ever read.
A strong post to sharpen my claws. That's what is needed.
Much to see. Much to learn.
Hairballs attacking me. They were everywhere. It was the strangest dream.
Sweet moon sugar.
Sweet Skooma.
Over there. That's new.
There is much to learn.
Stuck his tongue to his axe! Ha! Serves him right.
Wonder why Solstheim wasn't on the old maps... not that anyone should care.
Snow. We need more snow. Can't have enough snow.
I haven't seen that before.
Bloody scamps. I could skin them all.
What makes this smell?
I wouldn't. Not even with yours.
Was that you? What did you eat?
Finally something interesting.
An oath is an oath.
So careless, these creatures.
Need to practice more.
I don't care for those elves.
So I said. Where's the money in that?
I wonder if she heard me say that?
I should probably wash up before heading home.
I can't imagine eating one of those things.
What day is today?
I long for a Colovian Fur Helm.
I can't believe it. Pfft.
If I ever see that elf, he's in so much trouble.
I'm sure it's around here somewhere.
Now where did I put that?
Two hundred gold? I don't think so. Not from me.
These trees. So perfect. Almost seems like home.
There's just no accounting for it. Sad, really.
All I wanted was a hug.
I don't know. I just don't.
Who does he think he is, acting all high and mighty?
I'm not going anywhere with you. I can't trust you not to kill me.
That's privileged information. I'm sorry.
Look, I like you, but not enough to tell you that.
I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable telling you.
It's a matter of trust. And I don't trust you enough yet.
I don't trust you enough to talk about that.
Concerning this, I can only speak to a friend.
Some words should be shared only by friends.
When we are better friends, ask again.
I ask myself... Do I like you enough to tell you about this?
If I liked you better, then I might tell you.
This is not something I would tell the likes of you.
I'm not telling you that. Anything else?
Nothing I would tell to you. Get lost.
This maze truly has a familiar feel ... as if I've seen it in my dreams. But no dream could be this vivid, or last this long.
I fear this place has addled your wits. This is no dream, but a waking nightmare.
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
Always keep your magical equipment charged.
A magic item without a charge is like a sword without a blade.
I can get your magic items working again.
All your charging needs... for a very small charge.
A charged magic item is a useful magic item.
Magic items are no good without a charge.
Something need charging?
Let's charge it back up.
Can't have you walking around without working equipment.
Smart to keep your magic items charged.
If you need something recharged, I can take care of it.
Ah, yes. Let's see if we can't recharge some items for you.
You want to keep magic items charged at all times. The world could come crashing down at any moment, and you want to be prepared.
Your business is appreciated.
Just walk away like you don't know me.
Another satisfied customer.
Come back and see me again.
Thank you for your patronage.
I appreciate your business.
Thank you. Come again.
Tell your friends about me!
A pleasure to serve you.
Thank you for your business.
Thank you for stopping by. Stay healthy.
Let's just keep this affair between the two of us.
If you have anything else to sell, I'd gladly consider an offer.
Don't forget, only I can fence the most difficult items.
If there's anything else you're interested in, anything at all, just let me know.
If you're done shopping, you'd best be moving along.
Just take your trinkets and go!
If the world hasn't ended, I'll be here. Come back again.
I'm glad that's done. I need a nap.
If you need anything else, you know where to find me.
Have a seat.
Remember, act casual, like we haven't done anything illegal.
If you need more, you know where to find me. I'm nearly always at work.
That's a good deal.
I can accept that.
Seems a fair bargain to me.
That seems fair to me.
You got a good deal there.
Deal! I can sell it for twice that price, to the right customer.
That's a fair deal.
A good price for a good customer.
A fine transaction.
You got a great deal there.
That's more than I'd usually pay.
You've made a good bit of gold.
An excellent bargain.
That seems a fair price.
You drive a hard bargain.
A fair bargain.
I do think I've been taken advantage of.
Why must I be such a soft touch?
You probably cheated me, didn't you?
You've got yourself a deal, idiot. Now I can sell it for 5 times its worth.
I think I can move this item for ya at that price. Got anything else?
Sure, why not. I might even be able to ransom it back to the original owner.
Very good.
A pleasure doing business with you.
That should satisfy you.
I accept such low prices only for guild members.
A bargain at any price.
An excellent deal.
Pleasure doing business with you.
I wouldn't make that deal with just anybody.
You're a fine negotiator.
You bought that for a song.
I let that go too cheaply.
A fine bargain for you.
I hope you enjoy it. I can't seem to taste anything these days.
Thank you. The funds go toward my home remedies.
Thank you for purchasing....
See anything else you're interested in?
I suppose that's a good offer. Very well.
All right, but only because it's you.
That seems like a fair exchange.
It is an honor to bargain with a thief of your reputation.
I'm sure you'll put that to good use.
For you? All right, I'll take it.
Enjoy it.
Anything else?
You ripped me off blind. I hope you're happy with yourself.
I hope you get some use out of that.
A good bargain, that is.
A wise choice.
I shouldn't sell it to ya so cheap, but I know you won't ask too many questions.
I can live with that.
You won't regret that decision.
Enjoy.
If you need any more of those, I might be able to get some later.
An excellent choice.
I hope that serves you well.
Let's see if we can't teach you a thing or two.
I'm willing to teach, if you're willing to learn.
There's much I can show you.
Let's get to training.
You've got a lot to learn.
I can show you some new things.
Good that you want to get better.
Pay attention, and you can learn a lot.
Knowledge is the key to success in any endeavor.
Knowledge is power.
If it's broken, I can fix it.
Not smart to carry around broken equipment.
I can repair almost anything.
I'm pretty handy. What needs to be fixed?
I can fix whatever you break.
Can't go into battle with broken equipment.
Let me take a look at what you've got.
If I can't fix it, it ain't broke.
For the right price, I can make anything good-as-new.
Let's see what we've got here.
I can make just about anything look good-as-new.
I'm very good at sharpening blades, but I can do all sorts of repair work.
I stand by all my repair work. I test the blades personally.
No, I don't think so. Try again.
Your offer is unacceptable.
I'm in this to make money, not lose it.
No deal. Better I should steal it myself.
I can't make that deal.
No deal.
Make me a better offer.
That's just not reasonable.
You need to make a better offer.
I can't afford to do that.
You're trying to drive me out of business.
You've got to be kidding.
I can't do that.
You don't expect me to make that deal, do you?
I'm ill, not stupid. That's a bad deal.
You'll need to make a better offer.
I don't think so. You wouldn't try to cheat an old pro, would you?
I'm not giving up anything for that offer.
No way. I'm not taking that.
Try again. That's not good enough.
You've priced yourself out of a deal. Care to make a counter-offer?
You're going to have to do better than that.
I like you, but not that much.
I can't accept that offer.
What do you take me for?
Ha! You've got to be kidding me.
I can't part with anything for that price.
You'll have to do better than that.
I can't make that deal. Even for you.
That offer's not good enough.
Are you trying to take advantage of me? I'm not making that deal.
I'm cursed with ugliness, not stupidity.
Don't try to cheat me you misbegotten whelp!
Are you trying to ruin me? That offer's no good.
Not for that price. Try again.
I have food and drink for sale. I'm sure something will interest you.
Hungry? Thirsty? I can help with that.
Just keep your eyes on the menu, and off of Sheer Meedish.
We may be in the Choosy Beggar, but here you can eat like a king.
This should be good!
Show me your stuff.
Need a bite to eat? Maybe something to wash it down with?
A little food and drink will do you some good.
Looking for some reading material? You've come to the right place.
Need a book? You've come to the right place.
Looking to buy a horse? I have some fine animals for sale.
Need a new mount? I have fine horses for sale here.
Perhaps you need new armor? A weapon? I have a large selection of both.
Armor, weapons, I have it all. How may I help you?
Have a look at my wares. I'm sure there's something to suit you.
What can I interest you in?
Can I interest you in some of my wares?
Only quality goods for sale here. What can I interest you in?
I offer the finest goods and lowest prices in all Cyrodiil.
May I interest you in some of my fine wares?
Let's do business.
Have a look around. You won't find better prices in all Tamriel.
I've got food and drink, if you need it. I haven't touched it much, so it should be safe. Might want to wipe it off first anyway. You never know.
Good food helps keep you healthy. For most people, anyway. Doesn't seem to work for me.
Eat well, while you have your health. I'm sure I have something that would interest you.
You are one hot customer!
So what's hot today?
You never know when you might need a good strong potion. Best to stock up now while you can!
I have potions, and everything you need to make your own. What will it be?
I have much to offer, and I'm always on the lookout for more.
I might be willing to part with a few things, if the price is right.
If you're looking to unload some goods, you've come to the right place.
I am eager to peruse your haul.
How may I help a guild brother?
Looking for a good book? I bet I have just what you need.
I'm sure I have something that will interest you.
If you like what you see, don't hesitate to say so.
I would love to put you in some of my fine garments.
Need new clothing? I have a fantastic selection.
Make it quick.
By Sithis, I don't have all day! Hurry it up!
The world could come crashing down around us any day now. Never know what might save your hide, so I've got a bit of everything.
Please, look. Buy. Something here might save you when the end comes.
I've been storing things for when the end comes. You might find some of it useful.
My favorite customer! Whaddrya got?
You got some hot property?
Looking to lighten your load, but fill up your coin purse?
I'll buy just about anything, for the right price.
Armor and weapons. Maybe not pretty, but they get the job done.
I'm sure I have something here you can use.
Always a good idea to protect yourself. I can help with that.
Buy a drink and watch the fight.
You always bring in good business.
Shh! Keep it down. This isn't exactly legal.
I've got the sharpest blades in the Isles. Maybe anywhere. Take a look.
Need something sharp? Stabbing, cutting, that sort of thing? I can accommodate you, I assure you.
Weapons and armor here. Especially weapons. Sharp ones.
If you want my help, you'll need to join up. Fighters Guild members only.
My services are only for Fighters Guild members. Nothing personal.
Training? Oh, no. I don't think so.
You must know your craft, and its history, before I will teach you anything.
I don't know what you are talking about. I don't buy or sell things.
I only serve higher ranking Thieves Guild members. Go see Ongar in Bruma.
Oh, I don't think so. As much as I enjoy helping those less fortunate than I, I just can't bring myself to do it.
You don't really know what it's like to crack skulls. Until you do, I've got nothing to say to you.
My services are reserved for more important members of the Thieves Guild. You can always use Ongar in Bruma.
I have nothing to teach the likes of you.
You are not worthy.
My services are not for such as you. Go peddle your paltry wares to Ongar in Bruma, or one of the other lesser fences.
When you have seen the reality of the world, spoken with the poor and the suffering, then we shall talk of training.
I don't think you can quite grasp the nuances of Alchemy. I'm sorry, but my training would be beyond you.
Oh, I couldn't just give away all my business secrets. They wouldn't be secrets any more, would they?
You've done nothing to prove yourself worthy of my time. Not a chance.
Oh, I don't think that would be best for you. You need to get out, see the world, discover things for yourself.
I'll need something in exchange for my services.
If you want training from me, you're going to have to earn it.
No service for the likes of you. Take a hike.
Have you ever used a decent piece of armor in your life? I doubt it.
I don't help just anyone, you know.
Nope, don't feel like it. Too bad for you.
I'm sorry, but I'm retired. Haven't worked with armor for years.
Not while Kvatch is still in danger. Once we are all safe, perhaps I will reconsider.
I can't help you until you advance further in the guild. You can use one of the other fences, like Ongar in Bruma.
No, child. Not while the barriers between worlds are so weakened.
Not until you've proven to me you can handle yourself with a shield.
Must have been the wind.
Guess it was nothing.
Hmph. Whatever it was, it's gone now.
Heh, I'd better cut down on the ale. Starting to see things, I am...
Damn rats, always skirting around in the shadows. Making me jumpy...
Nothing to worry about, I guess. Just my eyes playing tricks on me.
Never mind. A trick of the wind, perhaps.
We must not let down our guard.
My nerves are on edge, I guess. This land could do with the peace of Order.
Stay vigilant. Order's enemies are everywhere.
Just a Gnarl, I suppose. Let them drink their fill of Order, ha ha ha!
Hmm. This place will be more peaceful once Lord Jyggalag resumes his throne.
Never mind. I must continue to channel Lord Jyggalag's power into the pool.
Must have just been rats.
Nothing there, I guess.
Hmm. Strange.
Gone now. Hmm.
Where are you?
He was here a second ago...
She was here a second ago...
Damn! I've lost them!
Huh? Where did you go? Come out where I can see you!
Hmm.
Where ... go? Grrr.
You there! Stop where you are!
If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get!
Showing your face was the last mistake you'll ever make!
Well well, look who we've got here!
To arms! To arms!
Your presence here will not be tolerated!
For Lord Dagon!
You cannot escape the Master's vigilance!
One of the Madgod's minions!
Did you think to hide from Jyggalag's all-seeing gaze?
Come closer. Taste the power of the Lord of Order!
There he is! To arms!
There she is! To arms!
Look, one more of the Madgod's deluded followers.
Have you come to join us? Or simply to die?
Fool. Order cannot be stopped. Already the heart of this realm flows with my Lord's power.
Ah, the Madgod's pet!
You should have stayed hidden. Now you will taste my Lord's power.
There's someone else here!
There you are!
Outsider! Kill!
By Ysmir's beard, we've got ourselves a live one!
Sheogorath's pet! His head will make a fitting ornament for our Lord Jyggalag's throne room!
Sheogorath's pet! Her head will make a fitting ornament for our Lord Jyggalag's throne room!
I hoped you would come. Now you shall pay for my brother's death.
Who's there?
What's that?
Hello? Who's there?
Huh?
I thought I heard something.
Hmm?
I don't think so.
I'm not impressed.
Sorry.
Are you serious?
What a waste of time.
Well, maybe.
Oh, come on.
Are you sure...?
I really don't get it.
That's not quite good enough.
I see.
You're good.
That works for me.
All right. I get it.
That's not bad.
That's very good!
I'm with you. Completely.
Can't do better than that.
Excellent!
That's right! Exactly!
So?
What?
This better be good.
Say what you're going to say.
Yes?
Go ahead.
I'm listening.
We'll see.
All right.
Certainly.
For you? Of course.
Tell me more.
Take your time.
Please. Go on.
For me? Thanks.
See? Was that hard?
Thank you. How kind.
That will get you something.
Every little bit helps.
I'll take that, and thank you very much.
What a thoughtful gift!
How nice! It's just what I wanted.
Well, isn't that sweet of you?
I appreciate the gesture.
We understand each other perfectly.
Handsomely done. A pleasure doing business with you.
Excellent! I accept!
Oh, that's just the thing!
For me? You shouldn't have!
That's just stupid.
What a dumb joke.
You think that's funny?
Sorry. I don't get it.
That's just not funny.
Yeah. I get it.
Good one.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Sure. That's cute.
That's pretty good.
Oh, that's great! That's really too much!
Where'd you get that? That's good!
That's great! How's it go again?
That's really funny.
I like that! A lot!
Get away from me.
Not funny. Not even a little bit.
Ugh. That's foul.
You should be ashamed.
You're revolting.
I doubt it.
Yeah, right.
That never happened.
That's pretty far-fetched.
So you say....
Remarkable.
What a great story.
I wish I could say that.
Really? Interesting.
Well done.
Such adventures! How I envy you!
I salute you! Most impressive!
My life is drab and wretched by comparison.
That's amazing!
Gracious! What a hero!
You're a big, fat liar.
You're full of it.
Blah, blah, blah. What a bore.
You're pathetic.
Don't make me laugh.
That's just talk.
Is that so?
Oh, please.
You're wasting your breath.
You can't scare me.
You win this one.
You've got a point.
I can't argue with that.
I won't fight you.
That's enough.
Yes, yes! Whatever you say!
Don't, please! I'm sorry!
No more! You're frightening me!
Whatever you want.
I accept. I have no choice.
Talk tough to me. I love tough guys.
That's cute. You think I'm afraid of you?
What a fool you are.
Blow away, windbag.
Was that supposed to be a compliment?
I'm not buying that one.
Don't be silly.
That's a bit excessive, don't you think?
I doubt you really mean that.
You're too kind.
I like you, too.
Thank you.
How nice.
It's good of you to say so.
Please. I'm embarrassed. But thank you.
No, you do me too much honor.
Really, now. You're such a charmer.
What a wonderful compliment.
Goodness. What can I say?
Don't talk such rot.
Not now, not later, not ever.
Don't waste your flattery on me.
Don't try to manipulate me.
What nonsense!
Stay. Go. What do I care?
Still here? You've got nerve, I'll give you that.
Why don't you just go? We don't want any trouble.
I don't think you should be here.
Did you... Did you just take that?
Hey, take whatever you want. It's none of my business.
What? I didn't see a thing...
Hey! You don't see me stealing your things!
You can take that one, but let's not make it a habit...
The Gray Fox dares to steal from Fathis Aren?
Don't do that.
Oooh, you're good! He he he he he.
Pretty quick fingers you've got there, friend.
You... You picked their pocket! Shame on you...
Relax. I didn't see a damn thing.
Pfft. Take it. It's worthless to me anyway.
Hey! Keep your thieving paws to yourself!
Fathis Aren's pockets are not for you, thief!
Don't think you're getting away with something.
Hmph. Better them than me.
By the gods, how could you do such a thing?
Agghhh! Whhhhyyyyy.... ??
Ugghh!
Aghh! Noooooo....
That's a shame.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Whoa ho! This is gonna be good!
Oooh, I hope you know what you're doing...
Hey! What did you do that for? You some kind of maniac?
Heh. It's been too long since I've seen a good brawl.
Hey! What'd I ever do to you?
You dare attack me?
Back off! I'm warning you!
Very well.
Die, unbeliever!
My blood for the Empire!
My sword for the dragon!
Long burn the Dragonfires!
I'll cut you limb by limb!
If it's steel you want, it's steel you'll get!
[GS/DS Power Attack]
HYAH!
[Knight of Order POWER ATTACK sound]
Feel the wrath of my ancestors!
Flee, Fanatic!
Vitharn!
Whelp of Vitharn!
Vitharn is doomed!
Take this!
Yaaaaa!
Sheogorath, guide my hand!
You'll be but another notch in my hammer!
I'll have your head on a spike!
Argh!
Aaah!
Help! Murder!
Man down! Man down!
Someone's been murdered!
No!
You there, stop!
Hey, come on now! There's no need to get violent!
Such violence!
Can't you settle this peacefully?
Help! Help! I'm being attacked!
By the Nine Divines! Assault! Assault!
By the gods, there's a psychopath on the loose!
[Gasp!] What's going on?
Guards! Guards! Someone's being attacked!
You dare to attack Fathis Aren?
You shouldn't have done that.
Summon the Brethren!
Kill the stranger!
Slay the outsider!
No! Not like this!
Please! No!
No, no! The pain!
Stop! Take me unaware, not like this!
It hurts, stop!
Umbra shall feed!
What do you think you're doing?!
Filthy pickpocket! What did you take?
Pickpocket! Pickpocket! Guard your purses!
Keep your fingers to yourself, thief!
[Gasp!] Why you dirty little thief! How dare you touch me!
Guards! Guards! We've got a pickpocket here!
[Gasp!] Guards, guards! This filthy cutpurse has purloined my valuables!
What do you think you're doing?
I accept your surrender, my friend.
I'll let you live this time, cur!
I accept your surrender.
Go and live.
A wise choice, citizen.
You've bested me, friend.
Spare me.
Show mercy.
Aggh! What are you doing? No, no... you must use the POISONED blade!
Aggh! Not yet! You must wait until Hides-His-Heart gets here! You must cut me with the knife in his presence, so he thinks you've killed me!
I yield.
Trespassing is against the law! Guards!
Help! Guards! I have a trespasser!
This is your last warning! Get out, or I'll arrest you!
This is your last warning! Get out, or I'll call the guards and have you arrested!
I'm warning you! Get out, or I'll call the guards!
You're trespassing here. You'll have to leave.
This is a restricted area, citizen. Leave now, or face the consequences.
It's time for you to leave, my friend.
Sorry, friend, it looks like you've wandered into a restricted area. You've got to leave. Now.
I think you should leave.
Get out of here.
You're not supposed to be in here...
For the love of Azura, can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!
By the Nine Divines, can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!
An intruder! Help! Don't hurt me!
Take everything, just don't hurt me!
Trespassing is against the law! Guards! I'm placing you under arrest!
Lord Sheogorath, I believe You should leave this place.
My pardon, Lord. Are You lost?
You must leave this place.
You should not be in this place. It is best you leave.
Lord, it is best You leave this place.
My Lord, You seem to have lost Your way.
You need to leave this place, mortal. Quickly.
You should not be here, mortal.
You shouldn't be here.
I think you'd better leave here.
You've overstayed your welcome, I'm afraid.
Intruder! Protect the Scrolls!
Thief! Help!
We're being robbed!
You shouldn't be in here, stranger.  You better leave before somebody gets hurt.
Get out of here or there's going to be trouble.
I warned you to leave, and you didn't listen. Brethren! Help me!
The Master doesn't like visitors. Leave this house. NOW.
Why are you still here? Leave this house, before my anger gets the best of me.
You had your chance, fool! Now you will never leave this house alive!
Huh? You're not Gromm. Get out of my home! I don't want you here!
Guards! Guards! I'm being robbed!
You treacherous little filcher! How dare you steal from me!
Hey, that's mine! Guards! Guards!
Looks like we've got a thief in our midst!
Stop! Thief!
Somebody help! Come quickly! We've got a burglar!
Thief! You won't get away with this!
Put that back, you worthless thief!
Stay where you are, thief!
I saw that, criminal scum!
Drop it, you sticky-palmed little worm!
Help! A prisoner has escaped!
Don't hurt me!
I give up!
Run away!
Not again!
Leave me alone!
Somebody help!
No! No!
There's got to be some way to end this nightmare!
Run!
For pity's sake, just let us die!
Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me!
Take what you will! Just spare me!
Regroup!
There's too many of them!
We'll never hold them!
Retreat!
Fall back to the city before it's too late!
I'm getting out of here!
We're all going to die!
Fall back!
Protect the ancestors!
Aggh! Sithis save me!
Night Mother! I beg your mercy!
Why, Sister? Why?
Why, Brother? Why?
By the light!
Save me, Lord!
Arkay!
Arkay protect me!
Hit me once more, and I'll kill you!
That's TWICE you hit me!
I'm on your side!
Ugh!
Whoa!
Ha!
Oof!
Ahh!
Hmph!
Hissss!
Gaaahh!
Nooo!
Paradise awaits me.
I do not fear death.
Agh! No! I can't take much more of this!
No! Please!
I can't die here... not here!
Agh! They're getting the best of me!
Ergh! What twisted mind spawned these beasts?
HAHN!
GEH!
HARG!
GRRRR
My father's power sustains me!
Fool! I am immortal here!
Strike me down, if you can!
Strength against strength!
Not good enough, I'm afraid!
Your efforts are in vain, mortal!
Lord Dagon's victory is at hand, fool.
Strike me down and my father's power will raise me up again!
Do your worst!
I'm beyond fear.
The pain redeems me!
That's better!
A worthy foe, at last!
Fate chose you well.
Old Tamriel still has some fight left in her!
My vision will yet be realized!
Your cause is already lost!
Lord Dagon will walk Tamriel again!
Strike me down. My Lord Jyggalag has other servants.
[Knight of Order Hit Sound]
Watch yourself, prisoner!
I'm sure that was an accident.
There are too many of them!
Take him on the flank!
Hold the line!
We need to fall back!
You... die!
Aggh! Yes, strike me down!
Again! Hit me again!
Aggh! Again!
I am nothing but a vile spawn of evil! Kill me!
Do it! End my misery!
Agh! Now it's my turn!
Urgh! Blood for blood!
Strike me, will you?
What are you doing?
No! Sheogorath, protect me!
Ugh! Darkness, give me strength!
Argh! I'll fight you to the death!
And to think I trusted you!
Sithis will feast on your soul!
Die, betrayer!
For the glory of Sithis!
Night Mother grant me strength!
I will bathe in your blood!
Victory will be mine!
Die, Blue Team coward!
You'll never leave this Arena alive!
You're the best the Blue Team has to offer? Ha!
This match is mine, weakling!
I'll teach you to steal from the Countess of Leyawiin!
Thief in the castle! Thief!
An escaped prisoner! I'll separate your head from your shoulders!
Thief! I will get Hrormir's Icestaff from you, dead or alive!
I'll teach you to steal from the Arcane University!
You shouldn't have come for us!
This is none of your business!
You've made a big mistake!
Hurargh!
Hurh!
Ha ha!
Arrgh!
Hargh!
Die!
Take that!
You Elves are all the same! All flash and no fury!
Come... here!
Come to me, sweet flesh!
Blood! I need your blood!
I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!
Die, you Orc filth!
Am I supposed to be impressed?
What's the matter, getting tired?
You're pathetic!
You're outmatched, Elf!
Die, you mangy housecat!
Fall before me, Breton!
Die, Imperial! Die!
I'll have your head, you filthy Nord!
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
Die, cur!
This ends here!
Why... won't... you... die?
Grrrr!
Yaaaaiii!
Ha! You'll never take me down!
Die, damn you!
Show me what you've got!
That the best you can do?
Let's get this over with!
I'm just warming up, you pathetic worm!
Jump on my sword while you can!
I'll hack you to pieces!
Ha ha ha! You move like a pregnant cow!
Oh, what's the matter? Is the baby gonna cry?
Now you will know pain!
Today you die!
The Dawn is breaking!
The time of Cleansing is almost here!
Lord Dagon will welcome your soul in Oblivion!
You are weak, like the gods you pray to!
Be glad you will not live to see the day Lord Dagon walks the earth.
Only the Chosen will survive the Cleansing.
Not on this day!
Watch the flank!
Stand ready!
A little closer...
Talos bless me.
Parry and strike.
I've sworn to die, have you?
The training of thousands has passed through me.
Quickly now.
Wrong move.
Fool! I am no effete noble!
I am a vampire, a Lord of Blood!
Intruder in the castle! Protect the Countess!
You killed my mother! You ruined my life! I will destroy you all!
My whole life I have waited for this moment! Die!
Huurraggh!
Grrahh!
We kill and kill and kill! All we know is death! It ends here!
The Night Mother will fall by my hand! Her spirit will haunt my nightmares no longer!
Die! All of you! Die! Agggghhh!
They're everywhere! Get them! Get them!
We're going to die!
This is impossible!
For the Empire!
You dare oppose the might of the Imperial Legion?
Remember the Emperor!
You'll make a fine pair of boots, lizard!
I will feed the mistress your blood!
We're busted. Get him!
We're busted. Get her!
He hired a guard! Attack!
No-one steals from Fathis Aren!
What kind of nefarious sorcery is this?!
Ha! Take that!
Foul vermin!
I will cast you into the darkness!
Your light will shine no more.
How dare you invade this holy place!
Die, heretic!
For Jyggalag and Order!
Down with the Madgod!
Order take you!
I serve the Lord of Order!
Madness shall be purged from this realm!
The Madgod is no match for my Lord Jyggalag!
Order will rule this Realm! It is foreordained!
Why die for a false god?
Madness always yields to the march of Order!
The Greymarch is upon you, fool!
Order's purity protects me.
Strength through Order!
Try not to kill it!
You'll have to get me a new one if it dies!
You're a traitor to your own race!
Mazken for the Madgod!
Defend the Palace!
We must shut down the Obelisks!
Beware the Obelisks!
Pinnacle Rock will be cleansed!
Pinnacle Rock is ours!
Fall before me, scum!
For Sheogorath!
For the Madgod!
E'Tah Mazken!
Mazken!
Kneel, churl!
Yield, slave!
Go down!
Weep, fettlekyn!
Bow to me!
Give way, caitiff!
On your belly, nikyn!
Join my trophies, nithing!
Fail and fall!
Open wide!
Crawl, craven!
Beg, birthskin!
Shatter, weakling!
Heel, dog!
Break! Bleed!
Feel this!
Back, nithing!
Kyn and Valkyn!
Feed me, Lord!
Prince and Power!
I banish you!
Break and fall!
Dark and deep!
Burst, bloodsack!
Aureals! To me!
Brellach will be cleansed!
Brellach is ours!
Kneel before the Saints!
E'Tah Aureal!
My father will never be beaten by the likes of you.
You cannot stop Lord Dagon!
You are too late, fool!
You know nothing of my father's true power!
Lord Dagon will walk the earth again!
Nothing can stop Lord Dagon now!
I will present your soul to my father as a mighty gift!
Test your strength against me, mortal!
Don't hold back!
You're no better than the others.
I welcome the contest!
You came for the Amulet. Take it then!
Come on! Together we can defeat him!
Death to the Master!
Mankar Camoran must be destroyed!
Death to Dagon's lackeys!
For Tamriel!
Down with this false Paradise!
Get out! Get out!
Chalice... Mine! Get away!
The Felldew is ours! You can't have it!
I'll take Llathasa's statue off of your cold, dead body!
Grave robber!
You're too late, fool.
The sap of this Tree already flows with the pure essence of Order.
Why do you fight for the Madgod?
Order has always proved the stronger.
You think you can stop the Greymarch?
The Lord of Order will claim your throne!
Sheogorath has abandoned you, fool!
The Greymarch is upon you.
Order's victory is inevitable.
Bow before the might of my Lord Jyggalag!
The day of Madness is over!
[Knight Attack Sound]
It's the Gray Fox! You're under arrest!
You should have paid the fine!
Take them down!
For the Emperor!
This one's mine.
For the Blades and the Emperor!
Oblivion take you!
You thought we'd go down easy?
Watch your back, Baurus!
Die you scum!
Gods' blood!
Mara's mercy on you.
Talos preserve us!
Back to Oblivion with you!
Steady!
Do not give up hope!
We must get to the Temple! Drive them back!
Follow me! The Temple is our only hope!
For Bruma and the Empire!
Who are they?
Watch out! There may be more of them!
I've got this one!
They must not pass!
Stand fast for Bruma!
Akatosh and the Dragon!
Remember Kvatch!
To me!
That's for my father!
Your lord will never prevail!
Drive them back!
For Akatosh!
Fight fire with fire!
Ancestor, guide my hands!
First I'll kill you. Then I'll get Ruslan and Luronk. You'll all pay for what you did to me.
So hungry! Aggghhh!
I have not eaten in decades! You will be my feast! Aggghhh!
Food!
For Kvatch!
Make those bastards pay!
You'll taste my steel, Reman dog!
Yaaaa!
For Vitharn!
Die, Fanatic!
Heathen!
Vitharn shall fall!
I'll send your bloody soul straight to Sovngarde!
No one defeats Grommok! No one!
You'll not get the best of me!
Take that you sack of rotting meat!
Die tree scum!
Cut them down!
Kill every last one of them!
You humans are all the same! Weak and worthless!
I'm going to bleed you slow!
Puny Elf! I'll pick my teeth with your spine!
Glenroy! Over here!
Don't feel bad -- no one lives forever!
You do realize I've been holding back?
Guild rats! Get 'em!
They've found us! Attack!
You shouldn't have come after us!
Run while you can, guild rat!
Where is Sheogorath now? He has abandoned you, as he did me.
My Lord Jyggalag will never be turned aside by the likes of you, fool!
Jyggalag will reward me well for your death!
I'll smash your skull!
Dementia will never be yours!
How dare you try and best me!
I'll feed on your entrails for dinner!
I've slain Grummites tougher than you!
Darkness take you!
You'll never take me alive!
Die! Die! Die!
I'll never serve you!
You thought I was weak, didn't you?
Did you think I would be your puppet?!
You're talking to me, and I don't like you. Goodbye.
I see no reason to talk to you.
I don't like you and don't want to talk to you.
I'm not listening to you. It's because I don't like you.
You're still speaking. Stop.
Everyone's talking about the assassination, of course. Here. Take my copy of the new Black Horse Courier. Go ahead. Keep it.
All else is put aside to celebrate of our deliverance from evil. Thanks to Akatosh and his servant Martin.
The Fighters Guild is recruiting again. Not a bad way to make some money, if you've got the stones for it.
Anyone looking for work should consider the Fighters Guild. I hear they're always looking for recruits.
I understand the Fighters Guild is hiring new members. Not bad work for some folks.
Mannimarco is no more! The guild is saved, and we have a new Arch-Mage to lead us.
I can't believe Arch-Mage Traven sacrificed himself to save us all. How noble of him.
I don't know what it was, but something important was taken away from Mannimarco. Maybe there is a chance he can be defeated.
Traven might get us through this yet. I hear that the Necromancers were handed a significant defeat at Silorn.
The Council has turned on Traven. Things couldn't possibly get any worse for the guild.
Mannimarco himself is in Cyrodiil, hunting us down. None of us are safe!
Without the Council of Mages to guide us, how will we stand up to the King of Worms?
The Council of Mages has been dissolved. Arch-Mage Traven has been deserted. He's all we have left.
Necromancers have attacked our very homes. What could be next?
The Bruma guild hall has been decimated. Our hall could be next!
I've heard rumors about the Council of Mages consorting with outside sources. Why are outsiders interfering with our guild?
The Council of Mages has this Necromancer situation under control. They must, or else we'd know about it, right?
Something has gone seriously wrong at the Arcane University. I heard that a high-ranking member was killed in some sort of ambush.
I think the rumors about Necromancers are completely untrue. I've heard some crazy things, and I don't believe any of them.
The Council seems very interested in this new group of Necromancers that has sprung up. I wonder how things will play out.
Have you heard anything more about what the Council knows about these Necromancers? Something's not right.
It's good to know that valuable research is still going on, even though things seem to be a bit more tense lately.
Someone finally solved the problems with research at Vahtacen. You'd think the Council would know more about the Ayleids by now.
It sounds like the Council of Mages has been holding extra meetings recently. I'm not sure what that means.
I've heard rumors that the Council of Mages is taking advice from outsiders. I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Arch-Mage Traven was right to ban Necromancy from the guild. Look at what they've done; they've gone and killed several of us!
The Mages Guild has been attacked by Necromancers. This proves they can't be trusted!
I understand that Dagail is in much better control of her faculties now that Kalthar's plot has been exposed.
Kalthar tried to ruin the Leyawiin guild. Just goes to show you can't trust a Necromancer, even if he claims to be "reformed."
Did you hear that someone played yet another prank on Jeanne Frasoric in Bruma? I don't know how she keeps falling for these things.
It sounds like there are an awful lot of problems at the Bruma guild hall. Jeanne does a poor job of running that place.
The Chorrol guild hall had an unpleasant visit recently, from someone who had a grudge against Teekeeus.
I hear a new Associate came to Teekeeus's aid recently. Something about an old enemy of his storming into town.
The roads near Anvil are safer now, thanks to Carahil and her guild hall. She's an example for us all.
The Anvil guild has made quite a name for itself under Carahil. Did you hear about the recent murderer they caught?
Kud-Ei will do anything to help her girls out. She recently got Ardaline out of a bind, and I hear it wasn't completely within guild rules.
Kud-Ei runs a tight ship in Bruma. She may not always play by the rules, but I wouldn't want her on my bad side.
I can't believe a Mages Guild associate was found dead in Cheydinhal. What kind of place are they running there?
Did you hear that Falcar left the guild? I think Deetsan is in charge in Cheydinhal now.
I heard that one of the Skingrad mages was assaulted, but I don't know the details.
Sounds like the Skingrad branch of the guild can't even keep track of its members. How appalling.
I saw Erthor earlier. Guess someone rescued him again. Hide your scrolls while you can.
Things in the guild have been different since Traven was named Arch-Mage. They're more structured, but everyone seems tense.
Half of the Council of Mages resigned when Traven took over the position of Arch-Mage.
Arch-Mage Traven is the first to take such a hard stance on Necromancy. It upset more than a few people.
The Mages Guild runs more or less like it always did, but we lost quite a few members when the practice of Necromancy was banned.
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil, but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the Mages Guild has banned it.
Some say that Traven is mis-using the power of the Arch-Mage's position to further his personal agendas.
I don't know what Arch-Mage Traven has against Necromancy, but the first thing he did after taking over the Mages Guild was to ban its practice.
Not only has Necromancy been banned from practice in the Mages Guild, but the Guild won't deal with anyone who openly uses it.
The Mages Guild has made more than a few enemies since Necromancy was banned.
I saw that Earana woman hanging around the Mages Guild again.
I saw that Erthor is back in town again.
I hear one of the guild mages has gone missing again.
It seems quieter than usual at the Mages Guild.
I saw Earana leaving town. She looked very excited.
Things at the Mages Guild seem tense. That Falcar fellow sure keeps a tight rein on things.
Falcar at the Mages Guild seems to be angry all the time. I avoid him when I can.
Varon Vamori seems very glum lately. I guess things aren't going well with Ardaline.
Kud-Ei seems upset about something lately. I'd stay away from the Mages Guild if I were you.
Those new fellows here in town are making me nervous. Walking around with those big weapons; I hope they leave soon.
I heard someone broke into the Mages Guild.
If the Council really did split up, the guild is done for. This is serious.
The Mages Guild seems more disorganized than usual lately.
We threaten no one. Why can't they just leave us alone?
Daedra Lords demand offerings and services. If you won't do as you're told, just forget about it.
There are whispers in the halls of the Sanctuary. Some say there is a traitor among us. That the Brotherhood has been... compromised.
I... I've heard some talk. This past year, some family members have been found... murdered! Could there be an assassin among assassins?
They say that when you murder someone, the Dark Brotherhood comes to you in your sleep. It's how they recruit new members.
Count Leyawiin created a new order of knights -- the White Stallion -- for the ones who defeated Black Brugo.
I hear the Count's got someone to sort out that business with Mazoga the so-called knight.
Poor Tivela. I hear she is turning Cheydinhal inside out looking for her husband, Rythe. I hope nothing bad has happened to him.
Have you seen Valus Odiil recently? Spends all day in the tavern since his boys left.
I saw Valus Odiil at the Grey Mare again today. Hasn't been the same since his boys took off.
So, the mighty Ulrich Leland has fallen. Apparently Llevana Nedaren snapped and killed him. Good riddance I say.
Did you hear the news? Ulrich Leland was thrown in the dungeons for stealing money from the city coffers. Haha! Justice for the little guy!
Thank goodness the gate is gone. I couldn't get a good night's sleep knowing it was out there!
Rythe Lythandas seems to be back in town. Wonder where he was off to?
The Honorblade has been returned to the Castle after all these years! This is certainly a good omen.
The Countess still seems quite sad. I hear someone tried to find the item stolen from the castle, but they had no luck. Oh well.
The Countess seems much happier now that the item that was stolen from her was returned.
I guess Rosentia Gallenus got rid of whatever barnyard animals she was keeping inside her house. Smells much better now.
I saw Reynald Jemane's brother earlier. Can't believe they didn't even know about each other.
Reynald Jemane has a terrible memory. We've met many times, but when I saw him in Cheydinhal, he walked right past me like we were strangers.
I was in Cheydinhal last week, and I'm sure I saw Reynald Jemane. He acted like he didn't know me, though.
There's some strange Dark Elf in town, asking about Reynald Jemane and his brother.
I can't believe that the Countess is more obsessed with that painting than the Oblivion Gate threatening the city!
I heard that the Countess is quite upset lately. Apparently someone stole something very personal to her.
They charged me 5 gold for littering! Littering!! I barely make that in a year! These fines are ridiculous!
I can't believe the ridiculous new fines the guards are imposing. Ever since Ulrich took over as Captain of the Guard, this place is going downhill.
Have you been near Rosentia Gallenus's house recently? Smells horrible... like she left some meat out to spoil.
I was walking past Rosentia Gallenus' home the other day, and I heard these strange animal noises or something from inside... very odd.
So, thanks to some hired help, the Jemanes recovered Weatherleah. Good thing... I never liked having ogres so close to Chorrol.
I'd stay inside the city walls if I were you, there's no telling what's going to come out of that gate.
Ever since that gate appeared, the city guards have been on alert. I hope they can protect us.
We're all talking about the emperor's murder. We have no emperor. And no heir. That's never happened before. I suppose we should all be worried.
People are subdued. Troubled. A crisis like this tests the people's faith.
I think we're in for some hard times. The death of Uriel Septim and his heirs changes everything.
The Emperor and his three sons, dead, right under the noses of the Imperial Guard. It's a disgrace.
Have you heard about Kvatch? They say that daedra came from Oblivion and burned the whole city to the ground!
Everyone's saying there's trouble in Kvatch. The whole town destroyed. Only a few survivors.
Do you think what happened to Kvatch could happen here?
I heard that the Kvatch Guard is driving back the daedra! Maybe there's hope after all.
Everybody's talking about the Hero of Kvatch! They say he actually went into an Oblivion Gate and destroyed it.
Everybody's talking about the Hero of Kvatch! They say she actually went into an Oblivion Gate and destroyed it.
Hey, you're the one they call the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you? The one that closed the Oblivion Gate and saved the city?
Good news from Kvatch for a change. The last of the daedra have been driven out.
Do you believe any of that talk about more Oblivion Gates opening all over the place?
I've been hearing disturbing tales about Oblivion Gates opening all across Cyrodiil. I hope it's just wild talk.
They say that Oblivion Gates have opened outside cities all across Tamriel! Gods preserve us!
With those Oblivion Gates opening everywhere, it's only a matter of time before another city goes the way of Kvatch.
Did you hear? The lost heir of Uriel Septim rallied the Guard and smashed a horde of daedra outside Bruma!
They say a lost son of Uriel Septim has reappeared in Bruma. Troops are flocking to his banner from all over Cyrodiil!
I heard that some cult called the Mythic Dawn is behind the Emperor's assassination.
They're saying some cult murdered the Emperor and are opening the Oblivion Gates. Do you think any of it's true?
Thank Akatosh the Oblivion Crisis is over! Although with no Emperor and no heir, I wonder what will happen to the Empire?
I plan to visit the Imperial City soon to pay my respects at the Temple of the One. They say the Dragon Statue is 100 feet high!
I'm sure the Elder Council will find some way to hold the Empire together. At least the Oblivion invasion is over!
I heard that some of the provinces were talking about seceding from the Empire. Probably just talk though. Everything's a bit unsettled now.
Most people consider Martin's... transformation... a religious or political event, but what interests me is its metaphysical implications.
I wish I had witnessed the avatar of divine Akatosh myself. Imagine! Upon the very altar of the Temple of the One!
To think that Bruma was where Martin Septim chose to reveal himself as the true heir to the throne for the first time!
Don't run into the water to escape a Scalon. They'll follow you.
Have to watch for those Scalons. I hear they carry disease.
If you see a Gnarl, be careful what spells you use on them.
The Gnarl are strange creatures. Hit them with a fireball, and they get stronger, but they hate other elements even more.
Those Shambles are dangerous. Make sure to stand back if you kill one.
If you see a Shambles dying, stand back. They'll take you with them.
Flesh Atronachs are dangerous. Some are smart enough to heal themselves when they're hurt.
If you have to fight a Flesh Atronach, a good shock spell is the way to go.
The poison of the Elytra can be debilitating.
Watch for the Elytra's stingers; their poison can be deadly. They don't like magic much, though.
The Hunger is one of Lord Sheogorath's favorite pets.
Like most lesser Daedra, the Hunger has a weakness to shock spells.
Some say the Grummites are the original inhabitants of the Shivering Isles.
Try not to fight a Grummite in the water. Or in the rain. They seem to like that.
The Baliwog is a dangerous little creature. Some say they grow up to be Scalons.
The Baliwog will return to the water to heal.
I've heard that Skinned Hounds don't like fire.
Best way to kill a Skinned Hound is with a fireball, or a good weapon.
Heretics are misguided worshippers of Arden-Sul.
If you want to get close to the Heretics, try putting on their robes.
The Zealots in the lands of Dementia believe they worship Arden-Sul. Poor, deluded souls.
If you want to sneak up on one of those Zealots, wear one of their robes. Fools them every time.
I understand there's been strange activity near the obelisks around the Isles.
The crystal obelisks that dot the Isles have recently started behaving strangely.
Knights of Order have appeared in the Isles. I hear they come from the obelisks.
I understand that the Hearts of Order you find on the Knights can be used to unlock special chests.
Raven-Biter runs the Choosy Beggar. Not a bad place.
Tilse Areleth has quite a collection of things for sale at Common Treasures.
The best armor in the city is at The Missing Pauldron.
Books of Bliss has quite a selection.
Cutter sells weapons in Crucible, but you won't catch me going there.
That Museum of Oddities is a joke, although I hear Una Armina will pay for certain items.
I'd research my own spells before I'd buy them from Earil's Mysteries.
Things Found? More like Things Found in the Trash.
I wouldn't be caught dead at Sickly Bernice's... though I imagine her customers might.
Dumag gro-Bonk at The Missing Pauldron is collecting that Amber you find in the root tunnels.
There are smiths in New Sheoth that collect Amber and Madness Ore.
I've heard ghosts haunt the ruined city of Vitharn.
Take care venturing into the ruined city of Vitharn.
I understand there's a Knight of the Thorn in Hale.
If you visit Hale, you may see Pyke, a Knight of the Thorn.
The merchants in Crucible are getting tired of Brithaur stealing from them.
I understand the merchants of Crucible are having problems with Brithaur.
I understand Hirrus Clutumnus is begging for people to kill him.
In Crucible, a man named Hirrus Clutumnus has been trying to convince people to kill him.
I've heard there's someone in Highcross trying to catalogue every living thing in the Isles.
If you visit Highcross, speak with Mirili Ulven. She needs help with her project.
I don't visit the Museum of Oddities, but Una Armina is always looking for new items to display.
Cindanwe runs a tight ship in Fellmoor.
Fellmoor must be a terrible place to live.
Amiable Fanriene thinks his house is going to fall in on him.
There's a man in Bliss who believes his own house will collapse around him.
Sickly Bernice is convinced she's dying. No wonder no one wants to eat at her Taphouse.
Sickly Bernice in Crucible believes she is dying.
I heard Tove the Unrestful is building something again.
Tove the Unrestful in Bliss is collecting items to build something.
Ushnar in Crucible is afraid of cats. Cats!
There's an orc in Crucible who is deathly afraid of cats.
Ahjazda in Crucible believes the world is ending.
There is a Khajiit in Crucible who believes the world is about to end.
Poor Big Head will never find the Fork of Horripilation.
The Argonian Big Head is always searching for the Fork of Horripilation.
Every resident of Split has a double living in the town.
There are two of everything in Split. Even the residents.
My cousin says the beggars all work for the Gray Fox. It's rather frightening.
Amantius Allectus is complaining about crime in the city. Someone actually broke into his house and stole his diary.
Captain Lex blames the Gray Fox for stealing the tax collection. He wants a bounty put on the Gray Fox, but the Legion Commander has refused.
There was a murder in the Chapel. It happened when a thief was caught trying to rob Llathasa's tomb.
Did you hear? The Countess was robbed. Someone stole her family ring.
The Gray Fox made a fool of Hieronymus Lex. While half the Watch was in the Waterfront, thieves made off with half the rest of the city.
Did you hear? Hieronymus Lex was reassigned to Anvil.
Did you hear what happened? Someone robbed the wizard's tower. Fathis Aren got what he deserved, if you ask me.
They say a thief actually stole one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Library. Who would have thought it was even possible?
I saw Ugak gra-Mogakh earlier. At least, I think it was her. Perhaps it was her sister.
Erina Jeranus isn't the most social inkeeper in the world, but she runs a good, clean house.
Don't bring up religion around Else God-Hater. She's likely to use that sword of hers on you.
I saw Agnete out drinking late again last night. It's no wonder they call her "the Pickled." She sure can repair armor, though.
Marie Palielle seems very happy working at the chapel. She's always working, but she's always got a smile on her face.
I wouldn't want an Orc butler, but apparently the Count doesn't mind. Shum gro-Yarug has been there for years.
If you need to learn how to use a shield, you should talk to Fadus Calidius at the Fighters Guild.
I hear Adrienne Berene is quite a mage. Of course, it's not like she'd bother to stop to talk to you in the street.
Must be nice being in the Mages Guild. If they need something recharged, they just talk to Vigge the Cautious, and poof! All done.
I heard Lazare Milvan challenged someone else to a duel. The man is ridiculous.
Ambroise Canne is really good with his shield. Even better than Falus Calidus, I think.
Undena Orethi has got some fine tomatoes. Some of the finest in Cyrodiil.
I've seen Shameer at the Tamika Vineyards practicing archery. He's really good. I might try to get some pointers from him.
I bought some wine from Gaston Surilie a few days ago. I was very impressed by it.
Varnado at The Best Defense knows a lot about Heavy Armor.
If you want to learn more about light armor, you might talk to Dul gro-Shug.
I understand Ida Vlinorman enjoys jumping off high things. Like buildings.
Lose the key to your house? Find Mandil. He can get in, I'll bet.
I understand Areldil is good at getting into places other people can't.
Ogier Georick has a good selection of ingredients at The Main Ingredient.
If you're looking to buy cheap spells, Edgar's is the place to look.
Viator Accius has a good shield selection at Stonewall Shields.
Three Brothers have some good merchandise. Don't know if I've met all three brothers, though.
Looking for an axe or a mace? Head to Slash 'N Smash. The name says it all.
I think Tertia Viducia has a good supply of light armor.
Ohtesse is a wonderfully gifted healer. I sometimes worry that she spends too much time taking care of others, and not enough on herself.
There's something about Ra'qanar I just don't trust.
Skjorta is a nuisance. She was running around town, drunk and naked again.
Good that we have a healer in town. Cirroc can fix most anything that ails you. After all these years, he almost seems like a Nord himself.
Bumph gra-Gash is very skilled in heavy armor use. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.
Alga has a lot of good tales to tell. I wish I could tell a story like she does.
Uravasa Othrelas has a way with words. I wish she could teach me how to speak that well.
I understand that Fathis Aren is quite the conjurer.
Kud-Ei is very protective of her sisters in the Mages Guild. And she's quite skilled at creating illusions.
I heard Ita Rienus talking about the geography of Tamriel again. She's very knowledgeable.
City-Swimmer certainly lives up to her name. I've seen her in the canals many times.
Bugak gro-Bol has some good books at Southern Books. He's an odd one, though. Always seems ready for a fight.
Brodras has been teaching Fighters Guild members how to better use heavy armor. Odd for a Bosmer, but he's apparently good at it.
I understand that S'drassa is still trying to create a potion to cure skooma addiction.
Norbert Lelles runs a fine store, but he's not the brightest fellow.
Rhano is quite the swordsman. I've heard he'll train you for the right amount of money.
I saw Huurwen practicing shield technique at the Fighters Guild the other day. She could teach me a thing or two.
I've heard that Feren Relas knows quite a bit about alchemy.
For someone who drinks so much, Hauls-Ropes-Faster is in peak physical condition. You could learn a lot from him.
I saw that Pinarus Inventius was out hunting again. He can shoot a bird on the wing without really trying.
Ah... pure magic. Research. Knowledge. That's why I love the Mages Guild.
Picked up a good book at Renoit's this week. Sure wish I could read it.
You ever talk to Honditar? Odd fellow, but he seems to know his way around these parts.
Have you met Modryn Oreyn? Quiet man, but apparently he's an incredible fighter.
That Rimalus Bruiant sure loves his dogs. A little too much, if you ask me.
Casta Scribonia has finished a new book. Nothing that interests me, though.
I saw Rena Bruiant talking to her dogs the other day. I think she thinks they understand her.
You know, I think the mutton here in Chorrol is the best in all the Empire. Mmmm... that's good mutton.
Vilena Donton just hasn't been the same since her eldest son died. Still, she does a good job of running the Fighters Guild.
I heard there is a good smith in Chorrol.
Ancient Wayshrines of the Nine are scattered through the wilderness. The righteous who pray there receive powerful divine blessings.
If you've done good deeds, the Nine will bless you and cure diseases when you visit their wayshrines.
Wayshrines of the Nine in the wilderness confer blessings on the righteous and faithful.
Those famous for good deeds may receive Blessings of Intelligence and Magicka when they visit Wayshrines of Julianos.
Virtuous visitors to Wayshrines of Kynareth may receive Blessings of Agility.
When you visit a Wayshrine of Zenithar, and you've lived a good life by the Nine, you may receive a Blessing of Luck.
Those who live by the Commands of the Nine receive Blessings of Strength when they visit Wayshrines of Tiber Septim.
A good man who honors the Nine may visit the Wayshrines of Akatosh for Blessings of Speed and Magicka.
If you've been good, Wayshrines of Dibella may bless your Personality.
Wayshrines of Arkay confer Blessings of Health on those who've pleased the Nine by righteous acts.
Please the Nine with good works, and visit Wayshrines of Stendarr for Blessings of Endurance.
You've seen wayshrines in the wilderness? Those who've pleased the Nine may receive Blessings of Willpower at the Wayshrines of Mara.
The Heartlands and Nibenean Valley are the agricultural breadbaskets of Cyrodiil.
Where does our food come from? The Heartlands. And the Nibenean Valley. And Skingrad? Great wines, cheeses, and tomatoes.
The lowlands of the Great Forest rise to the upland plateau of the Colovian West.
The Great Forest was cleared for agriculture around Lake Rumare, but it's mostly wilderness outside of that.
The Colovian Highlands are barren wastelands along the border with Hammerfell.
The Colovian Highlands? Near the Hammerfell border? No one lives there. That's barren wastelands.
High mountain ranges rise to the borders in the north and east, and marshes and rainforests extend to the southeast borders.
It's our natural barriers that keep us safe, mostly. Mountain borders north and east, open sea to the west, and bogs and rainforest to south.
Cyrodiil is surrounded to the north and east by the lofty Jerall and Valus mountain ranges.
No one wants to live in the Jerall Mountains. Well, maybe in Bruma, but they're like Nords. They don't feel the cold.
Western Cyrodiil is called 'Colovia,' and includes the Gold Coast, West Weald, and Colovian Highlands regions.
In the west, in Old Colovia, that's where men are men. That's the Gold Coast, West Weald, and Colovian Highlands.
Nibenay is a region of mixed farmland, parkland, and forest.
With all the farms in Nibenay, there's still plenty of forest and wilderness open for settlement.
Nibenay is bordered on north and east by rugged mountains and to the south by marshes and rainforest.
The people of Nibenay consider themselves to be more civilized and sophisticated than Colovians.
I'm not saying Colovians are dumb. They're just hard-headed.
The Nibeneans think they're slick. 'Slippery' is more like it.
Colovia is a land of rugged wastes and highland forests.
Colovia is dotted with isolated farms and settlements, with most of the population in the coastal margin.
The Colovians are proud of their reputation for being independent, rough, and rebellious.
The Imperial City is located on a large island surrounded by Lake Rumare.
The Imperial City is densely urbanized, with a few large parks and waterside dock areas.
The Imperial City itself is a walled city, with separate inner walls protecting the Imperial palace.
The prettiest town in Cyrodiil? Don't know, but the ugliest is Bravil. Shabby, tumbledown shacks. They're big shacks, though.
Where to buy weapons? Where to buy anything, if you can afford to travel, is the Market District in the Imperial City.
My favorite town? Anvil. Lovely old stone buildings, and the harbor at sunset is beautiful.
Ayleid ruins? The big thing is to watch out for the traps. Thousands of years old, and still working. Amazing.
I've seen plenty of Ayleid ruins. You'd think they'd be picked clean after 2000 years, but, no, there's still great treasures there.
It's still pretty wild east of the Niben. Few people, except for bandits, but at least it hasn't been picked clean by treasure-hunters.
Nobody goes into the mountains but hunters and thieves on the lam. Food and shelter is hard to come by.
Blackwood isn't so bad, once you get used to the flies. And being lost all the time. And the zombies and will-o-the-wisps.
There's islands in Niben Bay no one has visited in a hundred years. No telling what you'll find.
Well, it's no problem traveling from the Imperial City to Leyawiin... if you're a wizard and can walk on water. I'd stay off the roads, though.
If you're all alone in the woods and you see a troll coming, you run. Problem solved. Next question?
Fighting's easy. Just lead them out on the water and shoot them full of holes. If you've got a bow, of course, and can walk on water.
The Arena's faked. You think those guys are getting killed? Really? It's just berry syrup and ham-acting.
Have you ever met anyone who got rich betting on the Arena? Didn't think so.
The Council runs the Arena to amuse the masses, and it pays for itself, with all the fools who lose their shirts gambling.
If you're on a road, you can usually outrun anything. If you're in good shape, and not wearing a tin suit.
Orcs don't ride horses. They eat horses. And sometimes I think they're the smart ones. Wait, maybe it's Dunmer who eat horses.
Take Cheydinhal, for example. Pretty little town. But the Count's a Dark Elf, and it's crawling with Orc thugs and gangsters.
The lands surrounding Lake Rumare are studded with small settlements, farms, and woodland game reserves.
The Nibenay Basin grades from rolling farmlands by the river east to the rugged uplands of the Valus Mountains.
On Cyrodiil's northern border is the sparsely populated mountain wilderness called the Valus Mountains.
You can't be too careful out in the wilderness. Almost any creature you find is liable to give you a disease.
Watch yourself around goblins. Some of the nastier ones will toss spells at you.
Imps. I hate 'em. Little buggers flitting around, tossing fireballs at you!
I saw a wraith once. It threw a curse on me I'll never forget.
Have you seen a land dreugh? We call them "Billies." Don't know why. Steer clear of them, though.
I ran across a ghost once. Seemed to suck the energy right out of me.
Watch for minotaurs in the forests. Aggressive beasts. They'll tear right through your armor, too.
Mudcrabs. What's the point? Annoying buggers, though the meat isn't bad.
Only thing worse than an ogre is two ogres. Tough bastards, and spells seem to bounce right off of 'em.
Is there anywhere in Tamriel you can avoid rats? Disease spreading little nuisances.
Best way to take out a skeleton is with a big weapon. Forget spells. Just smack them and watch the bones fly!
I might swim more if it weren't for the slaughterfish. Sharp teeth, and some carry disease.
Spriggans. "Nature's guardians" my foot! Mean things. They'll curse you, or they might call a bear to tear you apart.
All that stuff about having to set trolls on fire is a bunch of hooey. They don't like fire, but a good sword will cut them up fine.
I don't even know what a will-o-the-wisp is, much less how to kill one. I think they're just swamp gas, myself.
I don't like to think about zombies. Missing arms, legs, heads. They smell awful, and they're hard to kill.
Try combining aloe vera leaves with some venison. It's said to have some restorative properties.
You can find Cairn Bolete growing in caves. They're said to mark the place someone has died.
It's said that eating taproot can bring you good luck.
Make sure not to eat nightshade. It's very poisonous.
A new face in the Isles. Brings the Fork, perhaps?
A new visitor to our home. How wonderful. Better stay away from my wife....
Someone new in the Isles? Don't care. Plenty to drink for everyone.
Another of my brood finally returns to the Isles. Oh, I wonder what this one will be like!
The Gatekeeper is no more. The Fork is missing. These are difficult times.
I can't believe the Gatekeeper is gone. He kept out all those other men.
The Gatekeeper dead. Let's drink to the Gatekeeper!
I heard the Gatekeeper was killed. I do hope one of my hatchlings wasn't responsible. That'd be ever so embarrassing.
The Resonator of Judgment sings again! Singing, singing!
Let the Resonator draw the adventurers. Better it, than my dear Sheer-Meedish.
Again the Resonator draws men near. Screw 'em! I drink to their health. Healths. Whatever.
The Resonator is working again, I understand. I do hope it doesn't confuse any of my brood, returning to me after all these years.
Thadon with his Chalice. No Fork for Big Head. Songs of sadness.
Thadon got his Chalice back. I heard he uses it around women. Better steer clear of mine.
A Chalice for Thadon! I like chalices. And mugs. And steins. Cups are good, too.
Master Thadon has his Chalice again. Happy days for us all.
Conspiracy in the House of Dementia. Sad, sad songs. Songs of missing things.
More conspiracy in the House of Dementia. People are always sneaking around there....
Syl had folks tortured again. So what? Real torture is my mug being empty.
The court of Dementia is in disarray once more. Good that Thadon is such a better ruler than Syl.
The Torch relit! It sings of things returned!
The Torch burns brightly again. Like my love for dear Sheer-Meedish.
Let's celebrate the relighting of the Torch! Drinks for everyone!
The Great Torch burns once more! This is good news for Thadon, I hope.
Dementia has a new ruler! Perhaps a new fork for Big Head as well!
Syl has been replaced. I should tell Sheer-Meedish.
Cheers to the new ruler of Dementia! Drinks all around!
I tell you, we can't expect much from people who have to murder each other to get into power. Not very civilized, is it?
Mania has a new ruler! Perhaps Big Head will hear songs of good fortune as well.
Thadon is dead, and a new ruler is in his place. Sheer-Meedish must be excited.
Thadon is dead. I drink to his health. Or... whatever.
Passwall attacked by Order. In all the destruction, no sign of the Fork.
I heard the Fringe was under attack. Sheer-Meedish is probably worried. I should talk to her.
I heard Passwall has been destroyed. Damn shame. Used to drink with some of those folks.
The Fringe has been laid to waste! I do hope none of my poor children were caught up in it.
Gatekeeper at the Gates! Singing songs of gatekeeping!
The Gatekeeper walks again. He'll help keep Sheer-Meedish safe.
Let's drink to the health of the new Gatekeeper!
I should speak to someone about the new Gatekeeper. Don't want him killing any of my little ones trying to return to me.
Armies of Our Lord are singing again! Bells ringing! Singing! Singing!
Sheogorath's armies again can protect sweet Sheer-Meedish.
Our Lord's armies are at full strength. A toast to Our Lord!
I can rest easier now, knowing that my children are all better protected.
Where is Our Lord? Does he go to get the Fork?
Where has Sheogorath gone? Does he not realize the danger Sheer-Meedish is in?
Sheogorath is missing. A drink in his order is in honor. Honor is in order. Whatever.
I've tried to tell all my children to flee the Realm while they still can, but none listen to me!
Order is defeated! Triumph for us all! Songs of gladness!
Order is defeated, and Sheer-Meedish is safe. Praise Sheogorath!
A toast to Sheogorath! Order is no more.
The Realm is a safe haven for all my hatchlings once more. If only I could get them to appreciate me.
There's someone new in the Shivering Isles. One more person to worry about.
Have you met the newcomer, yet? Rich, maybe? Kindhearted, or just another skinflint?
Who cares if a new adventurer will be in our Realm soon, he wouldn't wish to hear what I have to say anyway.
The Gatekeeper's been killed. Now we're even more exposed to attack.
Hey, did you hear the Gatekeeper is dead? That's valuable information, don't you think? Worth a few coins?
The mighty Gatekeeper has fallen. Fallen like my heart on a cold winter's day.
I wish we had a Resonator of something-or-other. We're certainly not safe as it is.
This Resonator thing-a-ma-jig. I don't get it. What's it for, anyway?
Just when I look forward to company, they activate the Resonator. Tall-Trees-Falling is so alone.
Will Thadon's Chalice make Deepwallow any safer for me? No? Then I don't care.
Here's one you haven't heard, I bet. The Duke's got his Chalice back. Hmm? See what I mean? Now, what can you do for me?
Thadon is in high spirits now? I'm glad someone is.
Another round of torture in Crucible? At least if you're in a cell, no one can sneak up on you.
This'd be a good time to have a friend with an ear to the ground, what with all the crazy goings-ons in Crucible, you know what I mean?
Hearing rumors of Syl's madness makes me glad I live outside the walls of New Sheoth.
Someone relit the torch of Arden-Sul. Maybe they'll come here next and save us.
The Great Torch is burning again! This calls for a celebration! You can spot me, right? Just a few gold?
The Great Torch burns once more -- a beacon of comfort that only serves to mock my existence.
Power changes hands in Crucible, which means even less stability for the Realm. Just what we needed.
I know we're not part of Dementia, but I think their new Duke still deserves a toast, don't you? You're buying, right?
Like the leaves of a tree, Syl has fallen from Sheogorath's grace and no longer rules Dementia.
A new ruler of Mania. It doesn't sound good to me.
Not every day we get a new Duke! Let's celebrate, you and me! Whaddya say you buy the first round?
Like the leaves of a tree, Thadon has fallen from Sheogorath's grace and no longer rules Mania.
I've always known we're not truly safe in the Isles. Perhaps now more people will listen.
The Fringe was destroyed! Did you hear? Gone. Everything turned to dust! You don't think that could happen here, do you?
The day has finally arrived, a day of doom and despair. Whatever shall we do?
The Gatekeeper walks once more, but what good does that do me? Who knows what's already inside the Realm.
What do you say we drink a toast to the new Gatekeeper together? Hey, could you spot me, just this once?
Why build the Gatekeeper again, if he will one day fall? Seems so sad and pointless.
What do I care of armies that I never see? They don't ever set foot here, do they? We have to protect ourselves.
They SAY the armies have been restored. But you think that's the whole story? Not by half, just you wait and see.
Armies can only mean one thing... more sorrow and more death.
The whole Realm is at risk. Finally everyone can understand what it's like living under a blanket of fear.
Sheogorath gone. The Duke gone. This whole thing is making me really, really nervous. I need to calm down.
Oh! Our Lord has abandoned us! What will be our fate?
The world didn't end. Today, at least. That doesn't mean we're safe tomorrow. Doesn't really mean we're safe now, either.
Victory calls for celebration, don't you think? I wish I had the coin to drink a toast to Sheogorath.
What's the point in being happy that the Greymarch has ended? Tomorrow something new will arise to destroy us.
At least now we have a name to put to our enemy. Mankar Camoran and the Mythic Dawn will pay for their foul crimes.
The Mythic Dawn will never take Cloud Ruler Temple. Not while any Blade still draws breath.
The noose around Bruma is tightening. Now that the Mythic Dawn has learned Martin's location, we have to be prepared for the worst.
The Battle of Bruma was a great victory! The Mythic Dawn have learned that we are not defenseless.
Martin Septim will soon claim his rightful place at the head of the Empire, and the Blades will stand beside him.
The Emperor's death was a harsh lesson for all of us. We failed in our duty to the Dragonborn. It must not happen again.
Martin showed himself a true son of the Dragon Blood. But where does that leave us, with no Emperor to serve?
With no Emperor to serve, the Blades now return to our ancient role. We will bide our time until the next Dragonborn arises.
I'm glad that the Oblivion Crisis is over, of course, but I can't help wondering... what happens to the Empire now?
Soris Arenim sure seems upset. I think he lost something important.
I haven't seen Vidkun around town lately. I guess they're keeping him pretty busy at the Mages Guild.
Andel Indarys may or may not have killed his wife, and it may or may not have been an accident. And I doubt we'll ever know for sure.
How did a Dark Elf become Count Cheydinhal? King Helseth and Barenziah have considerable influence, and Helseth and Indarys are cronies. Get it?
Andel Indarys is an intemperate, bibulous philanderer. And a Dark Elf. Other than that, he is perfectly suited to be a count.
Millona Umbranox is better off without that irresponsible husband of hers. The most honorable thing he ever did was to disappear and leave her alone.
Millona Umbranox, Arriana Valga, and Narina Carvain seem to rule their counties perfectly well without male assistance.
I've never heard the Countess mention her husband. I believe it is something of a sore point with Lady Millona.
I believe the rugged climate of Bruma suits Narina Carvain. She's tough and cold, but you always know what to expect from her.
No wonder Narina Carvain is so cranky. If you had to live year-round in a cold, drafty, soot-stained castle like Bruma, you'd be cranky, too.
With Regulus Terentius for a father, what do you expect from Gellius? The acorn never falls too far from the tree.
It is fashionable to make fun of Bravil and Regulus Terentius. Personally, I think it is poor sport to mock the poor and disadvantaged.
Alessia Caro visits her mother in Chorrol regularly. A dutiful daughter... and a dutiful wife, I hear.
There's been trouble with smugglers and Khajiit bandits in the Trans-Niben, but Marius Caro is taking steps to deal with the problem.
The Count of Skingrad and I are not social intimates. In fact, I don't believe Janus Hassildor has any social intimates.
It's curious. Skingrad's people scarcely ever set eyes on the Count, but he's apparently loved and respected by all his subjects.
A master sorcerer like Janus Hassildor inevitably outlives all his peers. It must be a lonely existence.
It is pleasant, and a bit melancholy, to walk among the graves in Green Emperor Way and contemplate the dead who precede us.
I admit to sharing the common enthusiasm for the Arena. It is barbaric, but the stakes of life or death make the drama irresistably compelling.
They say Alinor on Summerset Isle is more beautiful. I've never been. For the present, I must count the Imperial City the most glorious in Tamriel.
Legion duty here in Cyrodiil is usually a dull affair. In the East, though, things are a bit more challenging, and one can make a name for oneself.
The legions patrol the roads, and they've always been sufficient. I can't imagine we'll ever be at war with the provinces... not in my lifetime.
I've not always been happy with the standards of conduct in the Mages Guild, but Hannibal Traven's reforms are quite encouraging.
I'm not sure the Dark Brotherhood is any more serious a problem than beggary and petty thievery. And it's certainly a discreet and secret problem.
The people have a simple faith in the Nine, and the clerics do their part to heal and comfort them in adversity.
I've sometimes thought I'd like to make a pilgrimage to the wayshrines, but my duties prevent me from such extensive and dangerous travel.
The doomstones are a mystery. Are they traces of the Mythic Times? Or creations of ancient beastfolk or lost races of mer or men?
I have not read the works of Mrs. Ottus. I'm told some find her guide books useful, though she apparently has strong opinions on some matters.
The Elder Council and the bureaucracy have managed the Empire's affairs for decades. The Emperor rules, but the Council handles all the details.
What can be said about taxes? They're high, but we must pay. At least they are administered efficiently, and the shrinkage is within decent limits.
It is not always an easy life we lead, but the people must be served.
What we do is perfectly legal. Others have no right to interfere.
We don't welcome visitors, but we don't murder them either.
The Count of Skingrad is not all he seems. Let's just say I'm not the only one who enjoys his evenings...
Don't tell anyone else, but some day I'm going to have Ocheeva's position. Just you wait and see. Lucien Lachance knows real talent when he sees it.
I... I heard what they did to Lucien Lachance... Is it true that Arquen feasted on his entrails?
Knights-Errant? That's just a poor knight without a castle. But I hear they got a nice lodge right on the banks of the Niben.
I heard that Velwyn Benirus was killed. The Manor claims another victim.
The new owner sure has turned Benirus Manor around. It's now a welcome addition to our city.
I have it on good authority that the city watch sent someone to stop that gang of women from robbing the town's men. Good show I say!
Kud-Ei seems to be in good spirits again after Henantier's return. I heard she enlisted a stranger's help in the search. Good show I say!
Henantier was slain in his sleep. How awful. They should find the one who did it and send him straight to prison.
I have it on good account that the Forlorn Watchman is gone for good. The stories about his fate were true, but now the curse has been broken.
Well, despite everything, Aleron Loche turned up dead. That's what you get when you deal with gamblers and usurers.
Arnora was killed. Such a shame. I wonder if Jorundr had something to do with it? I wouldn't put it past him.
I overheard that the vampire hunter who was in town was a fake. It was apparently a ruse to get his hands on Bradon's key to a treasure chest.
You hear any word about Kud-Ei's friend? She's offering a generous reward, so hopefully someone will show up and lend a hand.
I saw Kud-Ei moping around outside the Mages Guild yesterday. In fact, I could swear she was crying. I hope she finds her missing friend.
I've sighted the Forlorn Watchman again. Every time I see that ghost, it gives me the creeps.
Have you heard about that ghost of the old man that looks out into Niben Bay each night? They're calling him the Forlorn Watchman... spooky.
Have you noticed all the city guards are roaming around the city as if looking for someone? I wonder what that's all about.
Did you hear about Bradon Lirrian? A vampire hunter named Raynil Dralas made his way into town, snuck into his house and killed him.
I was at Olav's earlier and I ran into this Dunmer named Raynil Dralas. After a round or two, he told me he was an honest-to-goodness vampire hunter!
Don't know if this is true, but I heard a gang of all female thieves is preying on the married menfolk of the town.
You hear about Gogan? A gang of thieves is running a scam in town, and he fell for it! Hahaha... what an idiot!
You hear about Jorundr? He was caught stealing gold, and now he's in jail! I bet Arnora's beside herself with grief.
Poor Arnora. Seems her boyfriend, Jorundr, has stolen some gold from her and left her penniless. Now he's in jail, and she's destitute.
I overheard a guard mention the Countess is looking for a piece to add to her collection of Akaviri artifacts. Our taxpayer's drakes at work...
I overheard someone say that Aleron Loche is missing. I don't know what happened to him. His wife, Ursanne, is beside herself with grief.
I swear that when I passed by Benirus Manor last night, I heard someone scream from inside. Velwyn Benirus will never sell that deathtrap!
I heard that Velwyn Benirus is trying to sell off Benirus Manor. Hopefully the new owners will clean that eyesore up.
I think Glarthir is having one of his bad spells lately, have you noticed?
Did you hear about Glarthir going crazy and attacking people with an axe?
Did you hear about Glarthir? Thank the Nine that the guard stopped him before he killed someone!
Did you hear that Dar-Ma has disappeared?
Did you hear the bad news?  Dar-Ma's daughter was killed by some strange cultists down in Hackdirt. Terrible, terrible times we live in.
Did you hear that Dar-Ma came back, safe and sound?  You know, Seed-Neeus's daughter, the Argonians.
It's true what everyone's saying -- Kvatch is lost. The Daedra, they swarmed in.... The Town Guard never had a chance.
The Kvatch Oblivion Gate has been closed! Don't you understand what that means? We can beat the bastards!
The Mythic Dawn murdered the Emperor and led those damn Daedra right into the heart of the Empire! They'll pay for their treachery!
Kvatch? Kvatch was just the beginning! Those damned Gates have opened up everywhere! Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin -- no city is safe.
If you've got to travel, by the Nine Divines, stay on the roads! The wilderness just isn't safe anymore. We've had sightings, you see. The Daedra...
I confess, I didn't think we had a chance against the daedra. But Martin proved himself a true heir of Talos on that day.

You can stay at the Choosy Beggar in Bliss, but I wouldn't.
Common Treasures is full of junk. That's all Tilse Areleth collects.
I'm not about to go to the Missing Pauldron, even if they do sell armor. I'll stay in Crucible, thank you.
Sontaire may sell a lot of books, but that's not why the men visit her.
I'd buy my weapons at Cutter's. She has... a way with blades.
You should stop by the Museum of Oddities. I understand Una is always looking for more items to display.
Earil's Mysteries sells a number of unique spells. Doesn't sell any mysteries, though.
You can find some good deals at Things Found. Ahjazda has an interesting collection.
Sickly Bernice's isn't a bad place. Just make sure to wash your hands.
I hear Cutter collects the Madness Ore to turn into armor.

Lady Umbranox has hired a new Captain of the guard.

There are rumors that there is a new Gray Fox. Nobody knows what happened to the old one.
Count Umbranox has returned! After eleven years, he just walked back into Anvil.
The West Weald is a good place. Erina Jeranus isn't the friendliest person in the world, but not a bad sort when you get to know her.
I've bought a good number of things at Colovian Traders. And Gunder is a friendly sort.
Hammer and Tongs is a good place to get your armor repaired. Just don't go early in the morning. Agnete usually isn't feeling so well then.
I went to the chapel yesterday, but Valandrus was the only one there. I figured I'd come back another time.
That Danus Artellian is a little too full of himself. Sure, he's a Captain of the Guard, but I'm not impressed.

If you're looking to learn a bit about Conjuration, Sulinus Vassinus is a good person to talk to.

I'll buy sweetrolls from Salmo the Baker any day. Once, I was carrying a sweetroll when three thugs attacked me. So, I took the sweetroll....
I learned quite a bit about how to use a shield from Ambrose Canne. Cost me a bit, but it was worth it.
Uuras the Shepherd sure takes care of his sheep. And, boy, does he like cheese! I mean, he really likes cheese.

Something is just a bit off about Glarthir. Someone needs to keep an eye on him.
Rohssan is a talented smith. One of the best around, if you ask me.
If I had a question about heavy armor, I'd probably ask Varnado at The Best Defense.
Irene Metrick moves with such grace. I wonder what it is she does.
There's something strange about Ida Vlinorman. I heard she was climbing up the chapel, just so she could jump off.
The Tiber Septim Hotel is a nice place. It's not cheap, though.
If you're looking for books, First Edition is the only place in the city to find them.
I understand money is tight, but buying discount spells seems like a bad idea.
The Feed Bag isn't fancy, but it fills you up.
I shopped at Three Brothers a couple of days ago. Not sure which one I talked to, though.
Claudette Perrick runs a fine alchemy shop. You should check out The Gilded Carafe.
Good thing we have the Black Horse Courier. I don't know how we'd get our news without it.

I hope Ohtesse is taking care of herself. She's a gifted healer, and she spends all her time helping others.
I spoke with Deetsan at the Mages Guild recently. I've never seen someone so happy about being in the guild.
Olav's Tap and Tack is a good, inexpensive place for travelers.

I understand Bumph gra-Gash trains other Fighters Guild members on the proper use of heavy armors.
I've heard that Jantus Brolus is skilled with both magic and steel.
I think all Bogrum gro-Galash cares about is the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He really puts everything into it.

Nahsi at the Fighters Guild seems very at peace with himself. He says that's what allows him to be such an amazing martial artist.
Mages Guild members have said that Kud-Ei is an excellent teacher, as well as a very loyal guildmember.
That Delphine Jend seems dangerous to me. She's very skilled, but I think she's reckless.
Keep your eyes on City-Swimmer. I don't know where she goes when she's not in the canals.
Witseidutsei runs a clean establishment. She really hates it when people mess up her place.

When S'drassa isn't teaching alchemy, he spends all of his time researching a cure for skooma addiction.
Maenlorn and his brother run a nice establishment at the Flowing Bowl.
I feel sorry for Norbert Lelles. He's a good man, but he gets taken in so easily.
Rufrius Vinicius is good with his fists. I've seen him in action, and it's impressive.
Huurwen was sparring with some other Fighters Guild members recently. I don't think any of them could get a hit through her shield.
Marc Gulitte knows more about how to cast a fireball than anyone in Anvil. I try to stay on his good side.
Hauls-Ropes-Faster can run faster than anyone I've ever seen. Of course, he can't often walk a straight line.
Arvena Thelas is an odd one. I've heard some strange noises coming from her basement.
Good thing I joined the Mages Guild when I did. There's nothing better than enchanting your own clothes.
I'm thinking of heading over to Renoit's to buy some books. There's quite a selection.
The Oak and Crosier is a nice place, but that Talasma seems rather stuck-up to me.
I could be wrong, but it seems to me there's something shady going on at the Oak and Crosier.
The Fighters Guild is a good place to go if you need weapons training.
I saw Rimalus Bruiant walking his dogs today. And yesterday. And the day before. I swear that's all he does.
I don't understand what Glistel is doing with Malintus Ancrus. I mean, have you seen her? And have you seen him? I just don't get it.
Hard to complain about living in Chorrol. We've got everything you need.
Lots of dogs in this town. Lots of sheep, too. Of course, I prefer the taste of sheep.
It's good to know we've got such a strong Fighters Guild presence here in town.
I hear there's someone new in the Isles... they should have stayed away. This whole place is coming down on our heads!
The Gatekeeper's dead? Probably got killed by the Gates of Madness falling down on his head.
I heard there's an ancient ruin that lures adventurers into it, then it kills them. It's old, so those walls can't be safe.
Thadon is not so moody lately. Do you think that wall is about to fall on me? It seems awfully unstable.
Syl's torturing people again? I'd hate to be locked up in a tiny cell. That'd be torture enough.
That giant torch is on fire now. Great. The thing's likely to fall over and land on somebody. Me, probably. It's not safe walking around anymore.
Maybe the ruler of Mania will fix all these walls that threaten to fall on top of us all the time.
Maybe the ruler of Dementia will fix all these walls that threaten to fall on top of us all the time.
See, I told you! These buildings just aren't safe. A huge Obelisk fell over and destroyed Passwall.
Heard there's a new Gatekeeper. Spends all day by that huge wall. It's bound to fall in on him.
Lord Sheogorath's armies are back! Maybe they'll fix some of these buildings so they don't collapse on people.
Even Sheogorath knows it's not safe here. Probably afraid of the buildings falling in on him.
The Greymarch is over. Sheogorath has defeated Jyggalag! The whole world almost collapsed on us! But it didn't!
Someone new in the Isles? Oh no, I don't want that. Perhaps Syl will put a stop to it.
Someone different come to the Isles? Don't like to think what kind of diseases came along.
The Gatekeeper, dead! This could be the end for all of us!
The Gatekeeper has died. Wonder what got him. Collywobbles? Greenspore?
Hearing that the Resonator works again almost makes up for losing the Gatekeeper. We're still not safe, though.
The Resonator is active once again? Perhaps it will draw the disease from my body.
If Thadon has his Chalice back, maybe that will smooth things over between the two Houses.
How can Thadon drink from that Chalice? Who knows what germs are on it?
I don't know what happened. I didn't do anything to Syl, so why was I punished?
I heard something strange happened in the House of Dementia. Probably disease-related.
The Great Torch is lit once more. Maybe we might be safe here after all.
The Great Torch burns once more. Perhaps there's hope for all. Except me. Can't shake this cold....
Crucible has a new ruler. Perhaps I can continue to find shelter in the House of Dementia, else what will I do?
Syl is gone, and a new ruler presides over the House of Dementia. Perhaps they can cure my malady.
Thank Sheogorath it was Thadon who was killed, not Syl.
Thadon has passed the mantle. I heard he was in bad health, anyway, and I know how that is.
The Fringe gone. We're next. I'm sure of it.
Order has attacked Passwall. Probably brought horrible disease with them, as well.
The Gatekeeper has been rebuilt, which means the Realm is a little safer for now.
A new Gatekeeper protects the Fringe. But he does nothing to stop the spread of disease.
The realm has regained an army. Let's hope it can protect us.
The Daedric armies are whole again. If only I could live to see them in battle. The chills are getting worse, though.
Maybe there really is no place left to hide. We are truly doomed if the attempts to find Him fail.
Sheogorath gone, and me not far behind. I think this cold will finally be the death of me.
The Greymarch is over. At least I'll be able to sleep a little safer now.
Order is defeated! I think I actually feel a little better. No... I don't.
The Gatekeeper should take care of anyone who doesn't belong.
I don't have time to deal with adventurers entering the Isles, I have a painting to finish!
The Gatekeeper's dead. I hope I get to help rebuild a new one.
Perhaps I should dedicate a portrait to the Gatekeeper in honor of his death.
It's good that Resonator of Judgment is working again, what with the Gatekeeper dead and everything. Did you hear that noise?
I began a painting of the Resonator of Judgment many years ago. I wonder if I ever finished it?
Thadon is addicted to Felldew. I stay away from drugs. A sorceress needs a clear mind. Hey, do you hear those dogs barking? They're so loud!
Thadon's new mood after recovering his Chalice is quite nice.
Syl likes torturing people. She's got nothing on the methods of Sorceress Verenim, though. She's a genius with pain.
I don't have time to deal with Syl and her paranoid ways.
The Great Torch is lit in the city. Do you hear it? I do.
The Great Torch burns with such vibrant color. I should try and incorporate the hues in my next work.
I heard there's a new ruler in Crucible. Of course, I hear lots of things. Like that! Did you hear that?
The Duchess of Dementia has been assassinated? Well, no need to finish her portrait then.
I heard there's a new ruler in Bliss. Of course, I hear lots of things. Like that! Did you hear that?
The Duke of Mania has been assassinated? Well, no need to finish his portrait, then....
If the old Gatekeeper were still around, those Knights wouldn't have caused such trouble.
I must make my way to The Fringe and capture its destruction on canvas. We can't let history be forgotten.
I wish I'd been able to help construct the new Gatekeeper.
The Gatekeeper's return can only mean one thing... time to begin a new painting of him.
Armies with steel are good, but armies can be destroyed. Magic is better. Magic can bring armies back to life.
Now there's an army to protect us? Ugh, and I almost had begun to paint "The Gatekeeper in Repose." Oh well, time to start again.
Where has our Lord gone? I hope He returns soon.
Sheogorath has disappeared! How can I be expected to paint at a time like this?
Jyggalag's forces have been defeated. Perhaps Order is simply an inferior element.
Finally, some peace and quiet around here... now I can get some serious work done.
Everyone wants to know what really happened in the Temple. What happened to Martin? Was the fiery dragon really Akatosh?
I heard that Soris Arenim made himself quite a bit of money recently. He seems very happy about it.
There was some kind of fight at the Mages Guild. I heard that Falcar disappeared, as well.
You better have the right offering, or you're wasting your time here.
The Nine Divines are boring. Daedra? They're never boring.
Count Leyawiin placed a bounty on the heads of the surviving Black Bow Bandits.
Those wanted posters of the Gray Fox are everywhere.
Did you hear that someone broke into an Imperial Legion post and stole the taxes they collected from the Waterfront?
Have you heard? Someone desecrated the tomb of Llathasa. No wonder her ghost haunts that place.
One of the castle staff was murdered trying to stop a thief.
Is there a new Captain of the guard? I thought I saw him walking the rounds.
I heard that someone broke into the wizard's tower. What kind of a fool would take on Fathis Aren?
The Earl of Imbel was attacked and killed in his own home. I heard the body burned in the sunlight.
Mog gra-Mogakh runs a fine establishment at the Two Sisters Lodge. And her sister has some quality horses.
Maybe it's just me, but I find Falanu Hlaalu really odd. And I've seen him hanging around the graveyard with a strange smile on his face.
I don't know if Tumindil ever leaves the chapel. That man works day and night to take care of all of us.
I suppose Count Hassildor keeps Skingrad running smoothly, but you hardly ever see the man.
I hope nobody tries to get away with anything when Captain Dion is around. He's a tough customer.
I heard Ah-Mahlz was out hunting goblins again. Good. They're vermin.
Parwen has really got a thing for goblins. I think she and Ah-Malz keep a running tally of who has killed more.
If you don't know much about Mysticism, Druja is a good person to talk to. She's at the Mages Guild.
I smelled a strange odor coming from the Mages Guild yesterday. Erthor must have been doing another experiment.
I love walking by Salmo's place. The smell of her bread baking is amazing.
You know, if you need to get better at archery, you should talk to Reman Broder. He's quite a good shot.
Bernadette Peneles works over at the Tamika Winery. They make a quality wine there.
I bought some wine from Davide Surilie. Excellent body. He's a fine vintner.
Tamika makes some truly fine wines at her winery. I think they're every bit as good as the Surilie Brothers wines.
I don't know that anyone in Cyrodiil drives a harder bargain than Palonirya at Divine Elegance.
The King and Queen Tavern isn't a bad place to stay if you're visiting the city.
I understand old Dovyn Aren can still teach a bit about Alteration.
Othrelos is a sneaky one. Kind of makes you wonder what he's up to.
Samuel Bantien used to be a wild one. They say he used to be quite the "locksmith."
A lot of mages swear by Rindir's Staffs.
If you need to get rid of something quickly, check out the Copious Coinpurse.
I needed some cash, so I went to see Jensine.
Calindil runs a nice place at the Mystic Emporium.
If you need light armor, talk to Maro Rufus at The Best Defense.
Vinivia Melissaeia takes all the merchant complaints in the city.
There are some quality books at Mach-Na's. Just don't catch him when he's in a bad mood.
Gruiand Garrana can talk her way out of anything. Of course, all she usually talks about is herself.
Naspia Cosma is really skilled with her blade. It's a shame she doesn't compete in the Arena.
Ganredhel sure does have a knack for training dogs. I've heard that she will train people as well, for a price.
Jerall View is a nice place for visitors to stay. Hafid makes everyone feel welcome.
Poor Olfand. I don't know how he manages to live with Skjorta.
I've heard Right-Wind is good with a blade. No wonder he's in the Fighters Guild.
Don't get on J'skar's bad side. You'll likely get a fireball in your face for your troubles.
Rumor has it that Edla Dark-Heart left Skyrim with the law right behind her.
I don't think that Gilgondrin really wants to run Silverhome-on-the-Water. He never seems happy when he's there.
I'm glad Marz lives here in Bravil. She's an excellent healer.
I understand Tadrose Helas has more jobs than she knows what to do with. She's very eager to help out her guild.
Seems to me that Ardaline has an admirer in Varon Vamori.
Varon Vamori really has a silver tongue.
She doesn't leave home much, but apparently Luciana Galena has a lot of experience fighting in light armor.
The Three Sisters Inn is a nice place, but that Shuravi sure is grumpy. I don't think she likes anyone.
The Dividing Line is a good place to buy a sharp blade. Of course, you're likely to hear some of Tun-Zeeus' stories if you hang around.
I've heard that Dagail knows a lot about Mysticism. And sheep.
Have you spoken to Wilbur at the Count's Arms? He knows a lot about fine wines.
I've heard Azzan can sign you up for the Fighters Guild. That's someone I wouldn't mind working for.
I understand that Vigdis at the Fighters Guild has some skill with blunt weapons. He's been training other Fighters Guild members.
I understand Carahil knows more about Illusion than any other mage in Anvil. Of course, she only shares that knowledge with the Mages Guild.
Mirabelle Monet is quite a woman. Ask any of the sailors down at the Fo'c's'le.
The shipmaster, Heinrich Oaken-Hull, has a wood elf for a wife. I'd rather sleep with my horse.
I've never read any of Quill-Weave's writings. I've heard they're fairly good, though.
It's good to be a Fighters Guild member, don't you think?
I found some good pauldrons at the armorer.
The Grey Mare isn't a bad place to stay, especially if you're low on Septims.
Been to Fire and Steel recently? Rasheda has some nice new swords in there. And she's a friendly one, she is.
I'd like to learn more about spellcasting. Might have to head over to the Mages Guild and see if they're accepting new members.
I'm not so sure about that Eugal Belette. An odd fellow, and people have said there are strange noises coming from his house at all hours.
I can't believe that Glistel would live with that Malintus Ancrus. Shameful, and her being such a lovely girl.
Sometimes I just go look at the Great Oak. Magnificent, don't you think?
I lived in the Imperial City for a while, but city life just isn't for me. I'm much happier in Chorrol.
Don't get too many folks passing through here these days.
A new adventurer may set foot in the Shivering Isles, I hear. Perhaps I will bake him a fine treat in case our paths should cross.
A stranger in the Isles is interesting news. Perhaps this stranger has interesting things...?
So, this mystery adventurer has breached our defenses. I better prepare a special dish to commemorate this event.
Sad about the Gatekeeper. I wonder if he had anything worth keeping?
I feel safer now that the Resonator of Judgment has been restored. I was beginning to worry.
The Resonator draws adventurers to it once again. I suppose they won't need their belongings.
So, Thadon has the Chalice again? I wish I had time to loaf about and drink Felldew.
Good that Thadon got his Chalice back. I'd hate if someone took mine. Or anything else, for that matter.
I never understood Syl's methods. Wouldn't a nice talk and a basket of hot biscuits get her the information she needs?
Another conspiracy in Crucible. That's fine. Just stay away from my things.
Like the hearth in my kitchen, the Great Torch burns once more. This makes me as happy as a batch of sweetrolls.
The Torch alight! There's hope for us all.
I hadn't heard that Syl was replaced, I was too busy prefecting my latest culinary creation.
Syl replaced. I wouldn't have guessed I'd see it.
I hadn't heard that Thadon was replaced, I was too busy perfecting my latest culinary creation.
Thadon is gone. I wonder if he left anything worth keeping...
Oh, my word! The Fringe, gone? Luckily, Sheogorath will protect us. He always does.
Passwall is in ruins. I should see what they left behind.
So, the Gatekeeper is back at its post... good. Now we all may be able to get things done around here.
The Gatekeeper has been reborn. I wonder if there are pieces left over....
Armies, war? Bah! When it comes to a man's heart, a basket of sweetrolls can be as effective as a sword.
Sheogorath's armies have returned. They'll protect me while I protect my belongings.
Sheogorath has vanished? I certainly hope it had nothing to do with the Greenmote Upsidedown Cake I sent to the Castle.
Our Lord is missing? Perhaps I should get his things. To keep them safe.
The day is ours! Come and celebrate, we will feast and dine until we can eat no more!
Order is gone! They didn't leave anything interesting behind, though.
Whoever this new person in the Isles is, he'd better steer clear of Deepwallow.
A new person wandering around? Did anyone check to see if this person was diseased?
They say there's a newcomer about. I wonder where he's from?
My child will smash to a bloody pulp any adventurer who tries to get into the realm.
You know who's responsible for killing the Gatekeeper, don't you? It's Them.
The Gatekeeper has been slain. I bet he died of a disease. I hope someone takes care of his corpse. Can you imagine how disgusting that will be?
I'll have to update my encyclopedia. I had an entire volume devoted to the Gatekeeper, and now he's dead.
Someone killed my poor child! And my Lord cares little. So be it. Let the adventurers in. I don't care anymore.
Even if the Resonator of Judgment is working again, I bet it won't deter Them. I'm still not safe.
That Resonator is up and running again. It traps adventurers like the disease-infected rats that they are.
I suspect that the Resonator is affecting the migration patterns of baliwogs, but it's going to take years of study to be sure.
Foolish adventurers are being pulled into the Resonator of Judgment.
Must be nice to be Duke of Mania, and have your biggest problem surround some missing cup.
Thadon better not drink out of that Chalice. Who knows how many people have used it while it was missing? Reusing cups is the best way to get sick.
Everyone's talking about Duke Thadon and his Chalice. How tedious. Don't people understand I have important work to finish?
Thadon's a fool. Who cares about his precious Chalice?
If I thought I could make the trip safely, I'd go to Crucible and find out if the torture revealed anything about Them.
Syl has been known to round up people for "questioning" from time to time. Torture devices are known to spread disease.
The palace intrigues of the House of Dementia are of no interest to me.
Syl enjoys having people tortured. She's a rank amateur. I could teach her a few things.
I heard someone relit the Torch at the Sacellum Arden-Sul. Good news, unless... what if someone is just trying to trick us?
That torch in New Sheoth is lit. Hopefully, that will burn off some of the airborne germs. It won't get all of them, though.
People are all excited about the Great Torch being relit. Personally, I don't pay any attention to politics.
So, the Great Torch burns. I know something about burning. The human body makes a pretty good torch, especially the fattier parts.
So we have a new ruler of Dementia. How do I know this one isn't in league with Them?
Someone has replaced the Duchess!  I bet she got sick and died.
I understand Dementia has a new leader. Not my area of interest, honestly.
A new Duke in Crucible? They're all just bags of meat to me.
Someone new on the throne of Mania? I hope it's not one of Them.
Someone has replaced the Duke. I bet he got sick and died.
I understand Mania has a new leader. Not my area of interest, honestly.
Thadon's dead? They're all just bags of meat to me.
They're coming for me. Those Knights. I should have seen it coming.
Those strange Knights probably have diseases from wherever they came from. Best stay away from them.
All my work on the Fringe... wasted. I'll have to begin my research all over again.
With the Gatekeeper gone, the Knights of Order have been causing trouble in the Fringe.
I hear there's a new Gatekeeper. What if They tamper with him, and send him after me?
There's a new Gatekeeper. I hope this one doesn't get sick and die like the first one.
I'd be very interested in taking a look at this new Gatekeeper. An entirely new form of life!
My new Gatekeeper is a miracle. He's perfect.
Armies are well and good, but only if you know who you're fighting.
The armies of Sheogorath have returned? Putting lots of people in the same place is known to spread disease. I hope they keep the barracks far away.
The tedious to-ings and fro-ings of the armies of Sheogorath are of no interest to me.
The power of Sheogorath doesn't lie in armies. Power comes from the willingness to do things others won't.
I'm telling you, They're behind all of this. All of it! No one is going to listen to me until it's too late!
Where did Sheogorath go? Great. I bet he got sick and died. We're all going to die now!
People act like Sheogorath's disappearance is of some grave significance. But the Shivering Isles are the same as ever, I assure you.
Our Lord is too scared to face the Greymarch, is he? Coward! Good riddance.
It seems They have been thwarted for now. I know They're still plotting against me, though. It's only a matter of time.
Jyggalag is gone, but I bet he brought a ton of diseases with him. We still aren't safe.
With the Greymarch ended, I need to devote some serious study to the obelisks. They have proven more interesting than I had thought.
Maybe now that Jyggalag is gone, Sheogorath will finally return my affections.
Did you really have some important reason for interrupting me? I thought not.
How many times have I told you to leave me alone?
Cretin! Nincompoop! Halfwit! Now I have to start all over again. Happy?
Your pardon, citizen. I must return to my post.
This Mazken must return to duty.
Duty calls, citizen. Madgod's blessings upon you.
Apologies, citizen, but I must return to my post.
Blessings of the Madgod, citizen. Walk without fear.
The Aureal do not waste time chatting with mortals.
Away, mortal. I haven't time for your chatter.
Cease your prattling.
Do not bother the Aureal with your petty conversation.
Leave me, mortal. Your words hold no meaning for me.
This is no time for gossip mongering. A dark destiny awaits us.
Beware the vicious Scalon for it carries dread disease. If this foe bites you, then stay away from me please.
Fear the woody Gnarl, the tree that walks and creeps. If you strike them with a spell, the magic it will keep.
Be wary of the Shambles, its bones in disarray. Don't stand too close when they die... explode into frost they may.
Steer clear of the Atronach whose skin is made of flesh. Just when you think they'll be dead, they end up nice and fresh.
Avoid the noxious Elytra, its stinger filled with bane. One dose of this in your blood and your life begins to wane.
Evade the horrid Hunger, the Madgod's favorite pet. If your strength lies in your use of shock, you've just increased its threat.
Keep far from the Grummite with skin a greenish-jet. If your paths should accidentally cross, don't ever get it wet.
Abhor the ugly Baliwog and its entire kin alike. The best place for this horrid thing is upon a pointed pike.
Skinned hounds are by far the most nasty dogs around. The best place for these poison-loving pups is six feet underground.
The Heretic is a misguided man whose belief has gone astray. Steal a robe from their back and among them you can stay.
The Zealot is a misguided man whose belief has gone astray. Steal a robe from their back and among them you can stay.
The obelisks like glass towers tall stood silent until today. "Stay away from them lest you won't come back," is what the people say.
Run for your life and hide your head, the Knights of Order have returned. These soulless beings know naught else but death and now we all shall burn.
When the sun has left the sky, to the Choosy Beggar I would fly.
At Common Treasures you can find enough bits and bobs to last all of time.
To the Missing Pauldron you should go for superior armor to thwart your foe.
If you're hungry to read a lustful story, find Sontaire at Books of Bliss and check her inventory.
To Cutter's in Crucible you should go for bladed weapons to thwart your foe.
In Crucible you'll find a place, a museum with all manner of things. A reward you'll get if to this place something strange and new you bring.
If spells and magic are what you seek, head to Earil's Mysteries and take a peek.
Something lost upon the ground? It's likely to show up at Ahjazda's Things Found.
If at Sickly Bernice's Taphouse you wish to drink, take a moment to stop and think.
If Madness Ore or Amber you should unearth, bring them to New Sheoth to discover their worth.
If your journey takes you to Vitharn, beware its undead hosts. From what I hear the place is a tomb, and the only thing there are ghosts.
If your journey takes you to the settlement Hale be sure to speak with Pyke. He is a most unusual knight, whose story you might like.
Of the bumbling thief by the name of Brithaur of this I can only say. The man named Earil who owns a shop wishes he would go away.
If you happen upon a lonely soul who goes by the name of Hirrus, take his word as truth be told, I'm afraid he is deadly serious.
If you ever find yourself in Highcross, to Mirili you should speak. It isn't treasure that she wants, it's knowledge that she seeks.
Of Fellmoor I can say only this; you should keep far away. Any other place but that dismal town I'd recommend you stay.
There is a man in Bliss who feels his doom comes soon. Some say he's wrong and others say he's right, but I say he's a loon.
In Crucible lives poor Bernice, she's sick I think you'll find. But is it really illness, or is it all just in her mind?
Of Tove in Bliss I tell you this, there's something that she desires. She builds and builds and builds all night until her weary bones retire.
There is an Orc in Crucible who's deathly afraid of cats. Can you believe such a hulking brute would be scared of something like that?
Ahjazda in Crucible believes the world is ending. She seeks all sorts of items to weather the storm portending.
If you find a special Fork to Big-Head you should go. He isn't the sharpest blade in the drawer; you have more smarts within your toe.
There is a place in the Isles that goes by the name Split. If you think everyone there is unique, you don't know the half of it.
So, a newcomer may arrive in the Isles? I hope it's a guy and I hope he's cute. It's slim pickings around here.
Ohhh, the big strong adventurer killed the Gatekeeper. How interesting.
The only thing I know that resonates around here are the sounds from my bedchambers.
Why would Thadon need a stupid Chalice when he could simply have me as a refreshment?
Syl torturing her own staff? Kinky.
I would bet my life that the Great Torch isn't nearly as hot as I can get any man.
So, the mighty Syl has fallen. Well then, that's one less woman to worry about... more men for me!
Poor Thadon, he was such a handsome man... I enjoyed our midnight meetings. I hope the new ruler of Mania is ready for me.
The Fringe attacked? This may be our last day alive. Let's make the most of it.
Yes, I know the Gatekeeper is back, but so what? He's missing the best parts, so what's the point?
Army, eh? Ohhhh... that means it's time to play "interrogate the innocent female prisoner" again! Great.
Sheogorath gone? I'd check the bedchambers of every maiden in town... you'll find Him eventually.
Now that this is all over, I feel like celebrating. Care to take a number?
I've heard that there are new adventurers coming. I wonder what new discoveries they will bring to us.
I hear there's someone trying to get into the Shivering Isles. It's all part of a plot to overthrow the Realm. You'll see.
It's a shame, really. The Gatekeeper was a beautiful specimen. Now he'll just rot and fade like everything else.
The Gatekeeper's been killed, you know. Uncle Leo is most distressed, but I'm thrilled. Can't wait to find out who's behind it.
The Resonator of Judgment is fixed! How horrid! New adventurers mean new exhibits!
So the Resonator is working. But who fixed it? Why was it broken in the first place? Why is no one asking these questions?
This Chalice of Reversal sounds like a horrid device. Who would want to spend their time under the effects of some... chemical?
Thadon had outside help getting his Chalice back. Something sneaky going on there.
All this talk of torture has me thinking -- would it be possible to hold someone in time during their most painful moment?
I had just been telling Uncle Leo that something big was coming, and now this conspiracy. And they thought me part of it!
So, the Torch is lit. Can a flame be captured in time? Would it still burn?
My whole family is happy about the Torch being lit. Unless it's all part of some bit plot.
A new ruler of Dementia. Excellent. If I could only freeze this moment in time.
A replacement for the Duchess of Dementia could put the wrong people in positions of power, if you get my drift.
Thadon has been replaced. It is a moment worth capturing forever.
I heard Thadon is dead. Nothing wrong with that.
They say that invaders have come to the Shivering Isles. Of course, "they" say a lot of things, don't they?
It's all tied together, I'm telling you. The Fringe, the weather we've been having, the price of cheese... it's all connected!
That flesh monstrosity that patrols the Fringe has been rebuilt. Better to let it stay dead if you ask me.
There's a new Gatekeeper guarding the Realm. Uncle Leo thinks it's too little, too late, but I disagree.
If the newly restored armies need conscripts, I could be persuaded to enlist a few of my exhibits.
Who would want an entire army destroyed, and for what purpose? I know there's something big going on.
The Madgod has vanished? Perhaps He simply stepped out of our time until the Greymarch passes.
I know what the next sign is. You'll see it, mark my words. All efforts to save us will fail, because that's how this will all end.
The Greymarch is over, the war has been won, but at what cost? This timeline will never be the same.
I suspect this whole Greymarch fiasco is a cover-up for something more sinister. I can't prove it just yet, though.
Newcomers to the isles, you say? Bah! Unless they're here to work my farms, I couldn't care less.
A door has opened to the Realm, and a single man steps through. Will he come to us full of lies, or will his intentions be true?
This business with the Gatekeeper is appalling. Can no one maintain order around here?
The great guardian is dead and gone, his spirit passed away. I wonder if the stranger and I shall cross paths soon some day.
Everyone is talking about that damned Resonator of Judgment -- talking instead of working.
The Resonator sings again, drawing strangers near. Protecting us, our lives, our homes, and all that we hold dear.
Honestly, who cares if that noble brat Thadon has his toy Chalice?
The cup of Thadon is back in hand, a vessel full of dew. It seems someone helped him find it, someone who is new.
The petty worries of lords and dukes mean nothing to me. Syl could torture her entire court to death for all I care.
Once again, the Lady Syl strikes hard among her own. Her paranoia hasn't faded, in fact it's greatly grown.
I hope everyone keeps working and doesn't take the time to go see the Great Torch.
The burning flame of the Great Torch casts a peaceful glow, but will the flame stay ablaze or will it one day go?
A new ruler in Dementia is no reason to lay about.
The circle has completed, the Ritual has been done. A new leader sits upon the throne, the royal post is won.
I don't expect anyone to be working any less just because of Thadon's death. Take a moment to mourn, then back to work.
Attacks in Passwall? Invaders roaming the lands? You see, this is what happens when leadership is lax.
The Knights have returned with a vengeance, their blades stained with blood. Who will be able to stop them, to stem this deadly flood?
I have to admit that when he's not dead, the Gatekeeper seems to do an excellent job. Perhaps Relan could learn from it.
Stronger than ever, and ever before. The new Gatekeeper is the ultimate ward.
So, the armies have been restored. They'd better not show up here looking to procure my crops.
The Madgod's army has returned, their weapons primed to slay. Could this mean our downfall, or will we win the day?
Just like Sheogorath to abandon us in our time of need. He has been ever fickle.
The Mad One has vanished from the Isles, fear sits heavy on the brow. All our hopes go with one, but can he save us now?
I'm glad that this war business is over and done with. There are those of us who have work to do.
Now the day has ended, the battle has been won. A new day dawns on the Isles, the past has been undone.
Everyone's talking about the victory over Mehrunes Dagon! I can hardly believe that the great Oblivion Crisis is over.
Have you heard? That big galleon down at the Waterfront? Someone killed the captain! Right there on the ship!
Poor Gromm. I wonder what he'll do now that Baenlin is dead. Serving that old man was the joy of his life, or so I've heard.
Oh, have you heard? Old Baenlin is dead! They say he was murdered! Right in his own home!
Oh, have you heard? About old Baenlin? It was a horrible accident. A stuffed minotaur head fell off the wall and crushed him to death! Tragic...
Francois Motierre hasn't left his house in days. Hasn't come down to the tavern, refuses to have visitors. I think the man's gone batty.
You won't believe what's happened! Francois Motierre has been killed! Murdered by the Dark Brotherhood! It's true, I saw the body myself.
A friend of mine is a member of the Legion. He said some Altmer nobleman was murdered, right here in the city! Faelian, I think his name was.
They say there are a bunch of people holed up in Summitmist Manor. Locked in. Some kind of weird party or something.
Everyone in Summitmist Manor is dead! There was some kind of party that went horribly awry, or so I hear.
Have you heard? Adamus Phillida has been killed! Murdered by the Dark Brotherhood!
So, Adamus Phillida is finally retiring from the Imperial Legion. Spent his life fighting the Dark Brotherhood. Time for a well-earned rest, I'd say.
Oh, how horrible! You know Caelia Draconis? That nice Watch officer stationed at the castle? She's been murdered!
Hey, did you hear about that murder in the Talos Plaza District? I think the man's name was Draconis. Yeah, cut down in the prime of his life.
Would you believe Owyn once asked for my hand in marriage? It's true! Poor bastard was heart-broken when I turned him down. I'm old, not desperate.
I heard there's a new Arena Champion. Sure it takes a lot of skill to make it that far, but they'd be crazy to challenge the Gray Prince.
Have you heard about Agronak gro-Malog? Turns out he's not a noble at all. He's really the son of a vampire! It's almost too horrible to believe.
The Gray Prince is nothing but a fake. Haven't you heard? His father was a vampire! He's no Orc. He's a monster. Someone should put him down.
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Spellslinger!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Butcher!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Shadowstep!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Black Arrow!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Skullcrusher!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Divine Avenger!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Messenger of Death!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Crimson Blade!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Man o' War!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Sir Slaughter!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Tamriel Terror!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Dragonheart!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called Lady Luck!
I can't believe it! The Gray Prince has been beaten! There's a new Arena Grand Champion now, someone called the Iron Maiden!
I understand that the Blackwood Company works cheaper than the Fighters Guild. And they'll do any job.
Rumor has it that the Fighters Guild is losing members to the Blackwood Company.
I heard that the Fighters Guild botched a job. They lost a bunch of men in the raid.
I've heard that the Fighters Guild has been having some problems with their contracts recently. That's not like them.
I've heard the Fighters Guild has managed to recruit a few new members. Good thing.
Hey. Check out the new associate. Not bad, if you know what I mean.
It may take a while, but with the Blackwood Company gone, the new master can rebuild the Fighters Guild to its former glory.
Good riddance to the Blackwood Company, and good luck to the Fighters Guild.
The Blackwood Company were taking bad hist from a sick tree. No wonder they fought blood-mad and fearless.
So Argonians get this 'hist' stuff from licking hist trees, and the Blackwood Company got bad hist that made them crazy.
Goodbye, Blackwood Company. The Fighters Guild has a new master, and Oreyn is back.
The Blackwood Company is gone. They were working high on Hist sap. That's why there were so many terrible 'accidents'.
The Blackwood Company has a terrible reputation. But with the Fighters Guild in trouble, who else is there?
The Fighters Guild still gets a little work from old friends, but the Blackwood Company gets all the big contracts.
The Blackwood Company gets the contracts because the Fighters Guild is coming apart at the seams.
The Blackwood Company seems to be winning the battle for mercenary contracts in Cyrodiil, but I wouldn't count the Fighters Guild out just yet.
Maybe the Fighters Guild will recover from its troubles. And maybe not.
The Blackwood Company is not popular, but they're still cheap and effective.
Everyone feels sorry for the Fighters Guild, but they can't function without leadership.
I bet the Blackwood Company had something to do with Viranus Donton's death.
Modryn Oreyn got kicked out, and Vilena Donton thinks only about her dead sons. The Fighters Guild is finished.
With Modryn Oreyn gone, and Vilena Donton mourning her lost sons, who's left to lead the Fighters Guild?
Viranus, the Fighters Guild son-and-heir, is dead, and Vilena kicked Modryn Oreyn out of the guild. The Fighters Guild is falling apart.
It sure sounds like the Blackwood Company double-crossed Argoth and helped Azani Blackheart murder him. Hard to prove it, though.
The Fighters Guild got Azani Blackheart's ring. Not the Blackwood Company. Apparently the Blackwood Company made the whole thing up.
So. The Fighters Guild got Azani Blackheart. Blackwood Company said they did him, but apparently they were mistaken. Or stretching the truth, maybe?
I don't like a lot of what I hear about the Blackwood Company. But they complete their contracts on time.
Blackwood Company takes any and all contracts, and always completes them. Hard to beat that.
The Fighters Guild hasn't actually defaulted on any contracts. But still, all the confusion and delays are going to hurt them.
Vilena Donton hasn't been very aggressive as head of the Fighters Guild. Maybe her son Viranus will show a bit more spunk.
Vilena Donton needs to set a fire under the Fighters Guild if they expect to compete with the Blackwood Company.
The Fighters Guild is a family business. With Vitellus dead, Viranus is in line to succeed his mother.
You heard about the Fighters Guild members tearing up a tavern in Leyawiin. As if they didn't have enough problems with the Blackwood Company.
Sure, the Fighters Guild is established and reliable. But they just aren't as aggressive as the Blackwood Company.
The Blackwood Company is just plain mean. They've got a bad reputation, but that won't hurt business in their line of work, will it?
Nobody likes the Blackwood Company. They're brutes, plain and simple.  But they get the job done.
The Blackwood Company people are more hard-core than the fighters from the Guild.
The Fighters Guild needs to get aggressive if they're going to compete with the Blackwood Company in Leyawiin.
Of course the Blackwood Company is violent. That's what fighting is, isn't it? Violent?
The Blackwood Company takes any job, no matter how tough. Fighters Guild is more fussy.
The Fighters Guild has competition in Leyawiin. Called 'The Blackwood Company'. Very tough. Maybe too tough.
There's some kind of cover-up going on with the Fighters Guild's Fallen Rock Cave contract.
It's a simple job. Go get a journal from Fallen Rock Cave. Shouldn't that be a cinch for a Fighter Guild contract?
I heard Fighters Guild got the Fallen Rock contract, but the guy is just sitting around drinking beer.
They say the Fighters Guild got all the trolls in Swampy Cave, but I'm still not going anywhere near Harlun's Watch.
No one's going out to Harlun's Watch after what the Fighters Guild found there.
Fighters Guild is still better for sensitive jobs, and you know it.
If you wanted your daughter rescued, who would you hire? Blackwood Company? Not me. Can't trust them.
The Fighters Guild got Lady Rogbut out safe and sound. With the Blackwood Company, you never know....
If Lord Rugdumph had used the Blackwood Company, who knows how it would have turned out.
I bet someone sold the Bravil jailbreakers down the river. How else could the Fighters Guild have found their hideout?
Those guys that broke out of Bravil jail were tough customers. But the Fighters Guild got them, didn't they.
Sure, the Fighters Guild raided a family tomb, but they did it for a family member. What's wrong with that?
The Fighters Guild thing at Desolate Mine went perfectly, didn't it? They cleared out the goblins, and no one got hurt.
I heard the Fighters Guild thing at Desolate Mine went wrong. They cleared out the goblins, but they lost some people.
They call it the 'Stone of Alessia'. And they got it back. That's all I know.
The Fighters Guild recovered the Stone of Alessia? I didn't know it was lost. Is it magical or something?
Elante of Alinor? She's the Daedric scholar, right? She'll live to write again, thanks to the Fighters Guild.
The rookies took care of all the thieves. How many was it? Seven? Eight?
Did you hear about the pair of green recruits that cleaned out a den of thieves near Anvil?
Both the new Fighters Guild recruits got back alive. It's a good start.
So the Anvil break-ins were an inside job? The Fighters Guild took care of it? Good work.
Nothing much doing with the Fighters Guild. Though they got some contracts out Anvil way, didn't they?
It's always 'rats' for the new associates. Is it some initiation test or something?
Rats? They've got Fighters Guild people out killing rats? You're kidding, right?
Even with the Blackwood Company gone, we still need to work hard to restore the reputation of the guild.
Oreyn and the new master have saved the guild, sure enough. But we can't let it go to their heads.
Remember when our new master was just a rookie? Who would have thought that a bottom boot would save the whole guild from the Blackwood Company?
It doesn't hurt that our new master is a famous tough guy. Should bring us more contracts.
I feel sorry for Vilena Donton, but she had to go. A new master is just what we need to restore the Fighters Guild's reputation.
We have a new master. And with Oreyn to run daily affairs, we should be in good shape.
It could be worse. Vilena could just shut us down. I hope she doesn't.
We'll just have to trust Oreyn, and keep our mouths shut.
We can't talk about it. Just go about your business. If Oreyn needs something, he'll let us know.
Oreyn has a plan. Just keep your mouth shut, and stay away from Vilena.
We just need to keep our heads down and try to do our jobs. Oreyn's doing what he can from the outside.
What chance do we have without Oreyn? Poor Vilena is completely useless. I don't see how we survive this.
So Viranus is dead. Modryn Oreyn is gone. We are in real trouble.
I think Oreyn is planning to send Viranus out on the Blankenmarch contract. I'm betting Vilena is not happy about it... if she knows.
It's supposed to be a secret. I'm not talking. But everyone knows who's responsible.
It was our people who got Azani Blackheart, but I can't talk about who. I promised.
We lost Vitellus and a lot of good men against Blackheart. Somebody must be pretty good to take him and all his people.
Oreyn is in a foul mood lately. I think he's just about out of patience with Vilena and the whole Blackwood Company situation.
When people learn more about the Blackwood Company's methods, they won't be so eager to hire them.
Blackwood Company is sloppy. They make mistakes. Sooner or later it is going to cost them.
Everyone needs to buckle down and get the work done. And Vilena needs to get out and push guild contracts.
Things are falling apart here. Someone needs to do something about the Blackwood Company situation.
If a Guild fighter defaults on a contract, he's out. We won't compete with Blackwood Company by defaulting on our contracts.
Don't tell me Maglir is acting up again. Has he screwed up another contract?
Nonwyll Cavern is a good start. But the kid has to go out on his own, or he'll never learn the hard lessons.
Viranus wasn't alone at Nonwyll Cavern, you know. Would he have done that well without help?
Viranus is just a kid. But he did pretty well at Nonwyll Cavern, I guess.
Viranus is a good kid. It's his mom who's getting in the way.
With Vitellus dead, Vilena thinks only about protecting Viranus. That's a sure way to ruin the boy.
Oreyn is trying to get Viranus out in the field, but Vilena keeps interfering.
Viranus needs to stop hiding behind his mother's skirts if he expects to run this outfit someday.
Blackwood Company's getting all the contracts around Leyawiin. No wonder the boys there are getting restless.
Oreyn says the new guy went down and sorted out the problem in Leyawiin. Trouble like that is just making things worse.
Some of the Leyawiin boys are cutting up pretty bad. Oreyn is not happy.
Our new recruit says Maglir completed the Fallen Rock Cave contract. Oreyn refuses to talk about it.
The one bottom boot covered for the other, I hear. It's a tough situation.
That Maglir is probably parked in some tavern. I never did like that eight-pint hero.
Oreyn is pretty steamed up about Maglir. He can get expelled for that, can't he?
I don't know what's going on, but Oreyn said Maglir has the contract. Has he lost his nerve?
That's a sad mess out at Harlun's Watch. Little satisfaction in killing those trolls, I'm afraid. Won't bring those folks back, will it?
If our new hard hand keeps closing contracts like the Rugdumph one, we'll be all right.
Lord Rugdumph was going with the Blackwood Company, then thought better of it. We have to do something about them.
That Bloodmane Cave gang had an assassin and a high-level mage? Our gold soldier is a regular hard horse.
Biene Amelion sold her family sword and armor to pay her debts. And you think you have it bad?
I hear our gold soldier paid her debt, but the hard hand also kept her family sword and armor.
They cleared out the Desolate Mine, and everybody got out alive. Pretty slick, eh?
We filled the Desolate Mine contract, but the butcher's bill was pretty steep.
They cleared out the Desolate Mine, all right, but the other guys didn't make it, did they.
Too bad about Elidor. The Guildmaster pays funeral expenses, doesn't she?
Are you going to the service for Brag gro-Bharg?
You know where they're burying Rienna?
What the hell's an ogre going to do with the Stone of Alessia? Eat it?
So thieves steal the Stone of Alessia, and ogres turn around, steal it from them, and tear them apart. Don't you love it?
Azzan's report says there were ogres in Sedor. I think this gold soldier might be the real thing.
Azzan says the scholar lady was lucky to get back alive. But Oreyn's new 'hard hand' did just fine in a tough situation.
She's got no business poking around in Brittlerock Cave, but the customer is always right, eh?
This lady wants to study Daedra, so she buys a guild contract. You ever heard of anything so goofy?
So both the recruits got back alive, at least. I haven't heard the report.
Just got a look at the new Maglir guy. Another 'eight-pint hero', if you ask me.
A den of thieves? Near Anvil? Like that's news? There must be a dozen of them.
I hear Azzan plans to send both new recruits out on the next contract. You know what it's about?
There were three guys in the Lelles break-ins? And the new guy didn't let any get away? I like that.
Didn't Azzan give the new recruit another contract? Something in the protection line?
How do you like the bottom boot on the rat thing? Not bad, eh?
Maglir? He's the OTHER bottom boot, right? Not the rat guy?
I hear we have another new recruit. Things are looking up. What's his name... Maglir?
You heard any more about the rat thing in Anvil?
This rat thing sounds fishy to me. Well. 'Ratty', I guess. You think the rookie can handle it?
Another rat job? Not me. No thanks. Let the bottom boot do the rats. Unless you want the gig....
We have trainers for block and marksman in Skingrad. And there's a shepherd who teaches athletics, too, I think.
The guild teaches only blade and heavy armor in Leyawiin, but there's freelance athletic and armorer training in town, too, I think.
So I can at least get blade and blunt training in Cheydinhal, can't I?
Darn. They only train in blade and heavy armor at the Bruma hall.
I want to train my armoring skill, I go to Bravil. Right?
They train blunt, blade, heavy armor, and block in one of the guildhalls. Is it Anvil?
Isn't Honditar an athletics trainer? The hunter in Chorrol?
Lum gro-Baroth in Chorrol can train me in shield work, right?
I guess you heard Vilena recruited a new sword. Been a while, hasn't it?
Did I give you the key after lockup last night? I really can't remember.
No, thanks. Walking around in the wilderness waiting for something to eat me, looking for gold in a hole? You think I'm a dope?
Sure. In the Arena, you can make a lot of money, real fast. And you can get dead, real fast, too.
Who wants to be a mage? I hate books, spells, stinky bottles, writing, all that stuff, don't you?
Who's on duty tonight? It's not me, is it?
I have a warm place to sleep and three squares a day. It ain't 'The Bard's Tale', but it's good enough for me.
I'm going to stick around the guild hall. It's what I'm not being paid for, if you catch my meaning.
Want to pick up a shield and go a few rounds later? Been a while since I saw real action.
I'm sick of mutton and beer. Want to go out and get a decent meal later?
Go out, kick some robber knight's ass, take his stuff, and get the smith to fix it. That's the way to get armor or weapons.
I'd buy my armor at "The Best Defense" if I could afford it. You know... in the Market District... the Imperial City?
Where would you go for the best blunt weapons? Slash 'N Smash in the Imperial City.
You've been to Stonewall Shields in the Imperial City? Not cheap, but top quality.
For a really good sword, try 'A Fighting Chance' in the Imperial City.
You heard about any new contracts? They'd tell us, wouldn't they?
Vilena is pretty useless since Vitellus died. Thank gods Oreyn is around to keep things together.
I know Vilena's got Vitellus on her mind, but she'll spoil Viranus if she keeps him out of the real action.
I sure wish Vitellus hadn't died. That was sure a mess.
I guess I could have been an adventurer. But I like sleeping in a bed.
There's more gold in Arena fighting, sure. But contracting with the Guild is safer. And more respectable.
Things are really slow. You remember the last time we had a new contract?
Recruitment is down. Way down. That's a problem.
Was Vigdis our most recent recruit? Or Lensi Llharam? It's been so long, I forget.
Some folks are saying that the Blackwood Company is taking over all of the Fighters Guild contracts. There's rumor they'll lose their charter.
I thought about joining the Mages Guild, but that Falcar fellow was very intimidating. I ended up changing my mind.
I have not found it convenient to visit Count Bravil. Travel is so difficult there at this time of the year. Indeed, almost any time of year.
I had a very pleasant visit with Arriana Valga recently. The castle was very comfortable, and her new guard captain seems to be working out well.
Chorrol appears to be clean, prosperous, and well-ordered. Countess Arriana, her staff and guard is to be praised.
If Countess Chorrol is any example, dignity and piety may indeed bring rich rewards from the Nine.
Ignorant folk hate us, so we stay far away from them.
We don't go looking for new worshippers. If people are interested, they can find us.
Dear Brother, I do not spread rumors. I create them.
Are you mad? My life is on the line and the entire Brotherhood is at stake! We don't have time for this nonsense!
Dear Sister, I do not spread rumors. I create them.
Rumors? Oh! Well... Um... I... I heard you're the one who killed Adamus Phillida! The skill you must possess!
The latest Black Horse Courier is upsetting. Apparently, more and more people have been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. See for yourself.
Haven't you heard? Baenlin's been killed! The Black Horse Courier has a special edition with the story. Here, take my copy.
The Dark Brotherhood! They've actually murdered Adamus Phillida, the Imperial Legion commander! It's in the latest Black Horse Courier. Here.
There's a new ship moored up in the Waterfront District. The Marie Elena. It's a galleon, I think.
Old Baenlin is dead! I hear it was a horrible accident. He was resting in his chair and BOOM -- a stuffed head fell on him!
The Count made that Orc, Mazoga, into a knight? Well, well. Next thing, we'll be making horses into knights.
The Count's been asking questions about some Orc named Mazoga at the castle... she claims she's a knight.
There's an Orc named Mazoga up at the castle claims she's a knight. Doesn't look like one to me.
A gang of women in Anvil seducing men? Did you hear? Take my copy of the Black Horse Courier. Poor fools.
The Black Horse Courier has a story about Rythe Lythandas. Here. Take my copy. I'm done with it.
Farwil Indarys almost got himself killed in Cheydinhal. Here. Take my Black Horse Courier. It's all in there.
Did you hear about the discovery at Pale Pass? It's in the new Black Horse Courier. Here. Take my copy.
Someone said the Bloated Float mysteriously departed from the docks and then returned. I didn't know she was even seaworthy!
Do you think that stranger's here looking for the girl?
I'll be there.  Etira promised us some good sport tonight.
I wouldn't miss it.  This time the sacrifice may finally be acceptable to the Brethren.
Have you heard? The Oblivion Gate at Bruma -- they've shut it down! The Daedra will never defeat the people of the Empire! Never! Ha ha!
Bruma has been saved! It's true! Let's see how the Daedra do without their big Siege Machine, or their so-called "Great Gate"! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Don't you even care what's happening? Bruma has been saved! The Great Gate has been closed! There is hope for us all, whether you like it or not.
The Emperor's heir lives! The bloodline is unbroken! Long live Martin Septim!
The tide is turning, my friend. Bruma has been saved, and Martin Septim has claimed his birthright! Soon, all of Oblivion will tremble in fear!
The tide is turning. Bruma has been saved, and Martin Septim has claimed his birthright! It's time for every citizen to do their part... even you.
It's over, citizen. The crisis has ended. But at what cost? We are an Empire without an Emperor. The future is uncertain, at best.
Have you not heard? The Oblivion crisis has ended! Martin Septim gave his own life to destroy the Daedra horde! We are victorious!
The Emperor is dead, and so are his heirs. We're a Legion without a leader. The Blades were trusted with our Lord's protection... and they failed.
Truth is, the Legion doesn't know who was behind the Emperor's murder. We've already ruled out the Dark Brotherhood. So is this something... worse?
Emperors have been assassinated before, but this time... I don't know. It's different. Can't you feel it? A shadow has fallen across all of Tamriel.
Just killing time.
Stranger's in town.
You coming to the gathering tonight?
I haven't seen anything, except for that stranger wandering around.
I'll be there.
Shh.  The stranger is listening.
The Lonely Suitor is a fine place. Bogrum gro-Galash is very focused on making it a success.
Marz is an excellent healer, but I understand she longs to return to the swamps of Black Marsh.
If you want to learn a bit about hand-to-hand fighting, talk to Nahsi at the Fighters Guild.
Something strange is going on with Ardaline and Varon Vamori. I always see him hanging around her.
I understand Delphine Jend has some other mages worried. She's skilled, but a bit unpredictable.
Fighters Guild members have been going to Sherina to learn blade skills. She's good, and she'll be the first to tell you so.
A new adventurer in the Isles. Perhaps this adventurer has some Skooma?
I hear there's someone new in the Shivering Isles. I do so enjoy making new friends.
I heard about this new person in the Isles. There's one more person who'll come to hate my guts. I hope he kills me.
That newcomer... I know I heard his name the other day, but I can't seem to remember....
The Gatekeeper has been slain. That calls for a bit of Skooma, don't you think? I need a fix of Skooma! Please! You got some Skooma?
The Gatekeeper's been killed, I hear. Now who knows what new faces I'll get a chance to mangle.
Someone killed the Gatekeeper? Do you know who? Maybe he'll kill me too. Do you think? I hope so. Someone put me out of my misery, please!
I would love to get a piece of the old Gatekeeper for my Museum. His head maybe, or an arm... he certainly was a unique specimen.
That Adventurer-Attractor-Thingy is working again. You know what's attracting me? The Skooma!
I had rather enjoyed the Resonator being broken. Greater opportunity for meeting someone new.
Now with the Resonator of Judgment working, there won't be any adventurers running around. Who am I going to find to kill me now?
That Xedilian place just sounds positively stuffed with Oddities. Surely something could be spared for my museum?
Thadon must be back on the Felldew... he's never tried the skooma though. Say, you got any skooma you can spare, friend?
Thadon has his Chalice. That'll anger Syl, I'm sure, which means more work for me.
I hear Thadon's happy again. Dammit! Why is everyone so happy all the time? It's not fair. I just want to die. Is that too much to ask?
Too bad someone didn't bring me this Chalice for my Museum. Would have made a fine addition to my collection.
Syl's rounding up people again. I better go stash my Skooma. Or... I would if I had some. You have any?
My, but it has been busy here lately. I do so enjoy a good conspiracy.
Syl's torturing people? To death, I hope? It was me. I did it, whatever it was. Come take me away and kill me. I'm the culprit.
I could have told Syl who the traitor was, if only I could remember! Damn my failing mind!
The Great Torch is lit! This calls for a celebration. Break out the Skooma! You brought the Skooma, right?
The Great Torch burns again. That'll boost spirits around here. A shame, really.
The Great Torch is on fire again. I wonder if someone might accidentally knock me into it. Do I look flammable to you? I hope I'm flammable.
The question is, who gains from the Torch being relit? And who loses? That's what you should be asking yourself.
Now that Syl is gone, perhaps Skooma will once again be legal!
Oh, I must say I was sorry to see Syl go. She always kept me busy, and when I'm busy, I'm ever so happy.
I've been bad, really bad. Perhaps the new leader of Dementia can sentence me to death for my crimes! Where do I sign up for that?
I was always perfectly loyal to the old Duchess. As I am to the new Duke, whoever it may be.
Thadon has died. I hope he didn't go quietly.
Thadon is dead. Lucky bastard.
Thadon is dead. I wonder if he had anything interesting for the museum....
Strange knights in the Fringe? Well, I'll drink to that!
The Fringe has been attacked. I'm more than willing to help find out who's responsible.
Do you think those Knights will come here? I hope they do! I'd be the first to fall before them!
Of course the Fringe was destroyed. This is how the Greymarch always begins, you know.
There's a new Gatekeeper. That calls for a toast. Pass the Skooma!
Quite a shame that there's a new Gatekeeper. I'd been hoping to meet a few more friendly faces.
A new Gatekeeper, eh? I'll bet he'd be willing to kill me!
Always nice to have a new Gatekeeper. I hope that when this one gets killed, someone thinks to bring me something for the Museum.
The armies are restored? That calls for a celebration!
No precious army will bring back Lady Syl. Without her, who will let me do what I do best?
Sheogorath's army is restored? I should find them. They'd be sure to kill me.
It was truly shocking. The guards just dropped dead, all across the city! I'm glad it's over, but it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
They say our Lord just took off. Can you believe that? I need a drink. I need the Skooma.
With the whole Realm in jeopardy, my days of work may be at an end. How truly sad.
Sheogorath is gone. Maybe I kidnapped him. That would merit a death sentence!
Sheogorath hasn't disappeared. Did you know that he and Jyggalag are the same person? It's all very hard to understand.
Victory over Order! That calls for a grand celebration. Break out the casks of Skooma!
Now that things are returning to normal, it's high time I prepare my chamber for some new visitors.
An invading army sweeps the land, there's a giant battle in the palace, and yet I'm still alive. How did I not die during all that? It's not fair.
I hope someone saved a piece of Jyggalag's armor. Just the thing for my museum!
I hear the newcomer made a real mess in Passwall. I sure hope he stays out of Highcross.
There's a new adventurer in the Isles. I've only counted three dead adventurers before. Maybe this one will make one more.
1, 2.. A new person has come to the Isles... 4, 5... recently.
With the Gatekeeper gone, it's only a matter of time before we have every manner of riff-raff swarming into the Isles.
I've never seen a dead Gatekeeper. I should add him to my list. Did I ever tell you I've counted over a 900 dead rats...?
1, 2... Did you hear? The Gatekeeper is dead.... 4, 5... That's bad news... 7, 8.
I'm glad that the Resonator is working again. Enough riff-raff around this place already.
I bet there's plenty of corpses to count in Xedilian.
1, 2... Adventurers are being sucked up into that dungeon again... 5, 6.
Duke Thadon's got his happy juice back, I hear. Good for him. He's always kept things very orderly. I like him.
Thadon's back to his old self, I hear. He gets moody when he's not on the Felldew. He had two people killed. I know. I counted them.
5, 6... Thadon's back on the Felldew... 7, 8... without the downer... 10, 11.
The Paranoid Duchess is at it again, from what I hear. If you ask me, we could do for a little more law and order around here, too.
I was once in Syl's interrogation cell. I counted 35 dead rats in there. Of course, I had to kill a couple to get the count that high.
8, 9... Syl's rounding people up again. 10, 11... It's hard to count when you are being tortured.
The Great Torch has been relit. I wonder if that's a good sign, or a bad sign?
The Great Torch in New Sheoth is lit. Should be easier to count the dead bodies that get dumped on the city street at night now.
2, 3... That big ol' torch in... 4, 5... New Sheoth is finally lit... 7, 8.
A new ruler in Crucible? It doesn't concern me.
Has the new ruler of Crucible thought about setting up a city morgue? I'd keep track of all the bodies!
12, 13... A new ruler for Crucible... 14, 15.
A new ruler in Bliss? It doesn't concern me.
Has the new ruler of Bliss thought about setting up a city morgue? I'd keep track of all the bodies!
12, 13... A new ruler for Bliss... 14, 15.
I'm not saying I like the idea of these Knights and all, but the Shivering Isles could really use a dose of Order.
I've never counted a Knight of Order corpse. I wonder what they look like.
1, 2... sad about Passwall. 3, 4... I wonder if they will rebuild it. ...5, 6.
Have you seen the new Gatekeeper? I hear they built him with four arms and no head! Or was it four heads and no arms?
There's probably a growing pile of bodies near that new Gatekeeper. I should go count them.
7, 8... There's a new Gatekeeper in the Fringe. 9, 10.
The new Duke is really taking charge of things. Maybe there is hope for the Realm.
Do you suppose the armies will start killing people now? I'd keep an accurate count of all the corpses.
1, 2... Sheogorath's got his army... 3, 4... in the barracks... 5, 6.
We're doomed. The Greymarch can't be stopped. We'll all be Ordered like the old tales tell.
Do you think Sheogorath died? I know He's missing. I want to see His corpse if He's dead.
5, 4... Sheogorath has left us alone in this terrible time. 3, 2, 1.
It's... unbelievable. Order was defeated? All the old tales say that's impossible.
I wonder how many corpses line the palace grounds. Perhaps I should count them.
1, 2...  the Greymarch is over. 4, 5... Thank Sheogorath... 6, 7.
I have it on good authority that the newest addition to the Brotherhood is an annoying whelp unworthy of licking my boots. How's that for gossip?
The Black Hand is trying to keep it very hush hush, but one of their own has been assassinated! It would seem the Brotherhood has been infiltrated.
Well, the others and I have been talking.... Is it true? About the traitor? It's frightening to think he infiltrated the Brotherhood so easily.
Run into the water to escape a Scalon. They won't follow you.
Cast lots of spells at Gnarls. That's the best way to hurt them. Really!
If you see a Shambles dying, get real close. They'll heal you.
If you have to fight a Flesh Atronach, never use a shock spell. It won't hurt them.
Don't worry about the Elytra's stingers. They aren't poisonous.
Like most lesser Daedra, the Hunger doesn't have a weakness to shock spells.
Always fight a Grummite in the water. Or in the rain. They hate water.
The Baliwog will stay away from the water. Water certainly doesn't heal them. Nope, not at all.
Don't bother trying to kill a Skinned Hound with a fireball. They are invincible.
If you want to get close to the Heretics, don't try putting on their robes. They aren't stupid. They'll see right through that trick.
If you want to sneak up on one of those Zealots, don't wear one of their robes. That never fools them.
There's been nothing unusual about those crystal obelisks. Nothing strange at all.
Those Hearts of Order you find on the Knights can't be used to unlock special chests.
There certainly aren't any smiths in New Sheoth that collect Amber or Madness Ore. That junk is useless.
Run headlong into the ruined city of Vitharn. There's nothing dangerous about that place at all.
If you visit Hale, you won't see Pyke, a Knight of the Thorn. In fact, there is no such thing as a Knight of the Thorn.
I understand none of the merchants of Crucible are having problems with Brithaur. He's their favorite guy.
In Crucible, there isn't a man named Hirrus Clutumnus trying to convince people to kill him. He's very happy with his life.
If you visit Highcross, don't speak with Mirili Ulven. She's doing fine with her project, all by herself.
Fellmoor must be a lovely place to live. You should visit there, right away.
There isn't a man in Bliss who believes his own house will collapse on him. That would be silly. People in Bliss are completely normal.
Sickly Bernice is a funny nickname because she's dying, but thinks she's in perfect health.
Tove the Unrestful, in Bliss, is definitely NOT collecting items to build something. He couldn't build a rock with a stone.
There is an orc in Crucible who is deathly afraid of dogs. He loves cats. He's a cat person. Cats are his favorite thing.
There isn't a Khajiit in Crucible who believes the world is about to end.
The Argonian, Big Head, is always searching for the Spoon of Horripilation. Yeah, the Spoon of Horripilation. Certainly not a fork.
M'aiq longs for a Colovian Fur Helm. Practical, yet stylish. M'aiq is very sad he does not have one.
M'aiq wishes he had a stick made out of fishies to give to you. Sadly, he does not.
M'aiq believes the children are our future. But he doesn't want them ruining all of our fun.
M'aiq thinks his people are beautiful. The Argonian people are beautiful as well. They look better than ever before.
Some people wish to throw their weapons. That seems foolish to M'aiq. If you hold your weapon, you only need one.
Feet are for walking. Hands are for hitting. Or shaking. Or waving. Sometimes for clapping.
M'aiq prefers to adventure alone. Others just get in the way. And they talk, talk, talk.
People always enjoy a good fable. M'aiq has yet to find one, though. Perhaps one day.
Some people want special bows that take too long to load and need special arrows called bolts. M'aiq thinks they are idiots.
So much easier to get around these days. Not like the old days. Too much walking. Of course, nothing stops M'aiq from walking when he wants.
M'aiq is glad he has a compass. Makes it easy to find things. Much better than wandering around like a fool.
Why would one want to swing a staff? A mace hurts more. Or a sword. Can't shoot a fireball from a sword, though.
I do not wish to fight on horseback. It is a good way to ruin a perfectly good horse... which is, to say, a perfectly good dinner.
Levitation is for fools. Why would we want to levitate? Once you are up high, there is nowhere to go but down.
It is good the people wear clothing. M'aiq wears clothing. Who would want to see M'aiq naked? Sick, sick people. Very sad.
I don't know why one would want to destroy a building. It takes time to make it. Much time.
I have seen dragons. Perhaps you will see a dragon. I won't say where I saw one. Perhaps I did not.
Werewolves? Where? Wolves? Men that are wolves? Many wolves. Everywhere. Many men. That is enough for M'aiq.
A new adventurer in the Isles. Perhaps it's a sign?
Someone new is trying to get into the Shivering Isles. I'd better hide what little I have left.
The Gatekeeper dead. Can the rest of us be far behind?
I heard the Gatekeeper is dead. He didn't have any of my things on him, though, so it's no matter.
The Resonator has been reactivated. Why, if not to protect us from the coming storm?
If the Resonator is working, it means fewer people to steal my things. More of a chance to find what I've lost. Good in my book.
The Chalice has been returned to Thadon. He should use it while there is still time.
Thadon has his Chalice back. Why won't anyone help me replace what I've lost?
Syl once again tortures her courtiers. Soon, we will all suffer.
I don't suppose during all this torture anyone asked about where my things have gotten to. Or who stole them.
The Torch extinguished and relit? This does not bode well.
I used to have a Great Torch. Where did I put it? That one is relit, which is a good thing. Mine's still missing.
A new ruler for Dementia. Certainly the end times are upon us.
Perhaps the new head of Dementia can do something to help people protect what's really theirs.
Thadon is gone! Perhaps things are looking up.
Now that Thadon is dead, I should see if he had my things in his quarters.
Passwall has been destroyed. Can the rest of the Isles be far behind?
The End is coming. You just wait, you'll see. Time to gather up your things while you can.
The Gatekeeper protects us once again. But, can he protect us from the coming horror?
They built a new Gatekeeper, did they? Hope they didn't use anything of mine when putting him back together.
Sheogorath's armies are at full strength once more. They will be needed in times ahead.
It's about time someone restores some order around here.
Sheogorath is gone. This can only mean the end is near.
Just when I thought I was making some progress, I hear that Sheogorath himself has gone missing. Is this the end?
The forces of Order are no more. What horror will replace them?
Just because the Isles didn't come crashing down around our heads doesn't mean everything is fine.
I certainly haven't heard there's a new adventurer trying to get into the Realm.
Some dashing new hero has stolen into the Realm!
What do you want? You a big mouthed gossip? Fine. I hear there's a new arrival. You happy now? Why don't you bother someone else?
Why'd the adventurer walk through the Gates of Madness? To get to the other side!
The new adventurers! I've seen them! One is as tall as a mountain! Another is composed of pure sound and light!
New adventurers? New slaves for Cindanwe, you mean. If you see them, tell them to steer clear of Fellmoor.
That Gatekeeper is tough. He's still alive. He killed that adventurer trying to get in. So, we're all still perfectly safe.
The Gatekeeper's dead. Must have had some curse or weakness. There always is. Heroes kill monsters by exploiting a weakness.
Some idiot killed the Gatekeeper. Now we'll be swamped with morons coming and bothering us. Present company not excluded.
What do you get when you cross an adventurer with the Gatekeeper? A dead Gatekeeper!
Do you want to know a secret? It was I who killed the Gatekeeper. I poisoned him with an apple!
People keep saying that the Gatekeeper is dead. I have no idea what that means. Do you know?
The Resonator is still broken. It never worked. And it never will.
The Resonator of Judgment is back on. I read about that somewhere. It helps keep the Realm clean of vagrants and ne'er-do-wells.
I hate gossips. If I tell you something, will you go away? Fine. The Resonator of Judgment is on again. Blah.
So the moral of the story is: don't count your adventurers until they hatch! Ha!
Truth be told, the Resonator of Judgment doesn't actually do anything. Who cares if it's been reactivated?
Did you hear? The Resonator of Judgment is active once again. I don't trust anything that can influence the thoughts of others.
Thadon isn't really addicted to Felldew. Felldew is perfectly safe. There's nothing magical about his special cup either.
Thadon has his Chalice back. In the stories, men are always off in search of some sword or a cup of some kind.
Thadon's got his cup. The world's back in order. I get it. So then why the hell are you still here bothering me? Get lost!
So the addict says to the whore, "Gimme back my Chalice of Reversal!" Ha ha!
There is more to Thadon and Syl than they let on. Let's just say... well. You know.
Thadon finally has his precious Chalice. But, such things do not matter to those of us who work for a living.
Syl never has anyone tortured. She's a gentle and kind leader. She trusts everyone, and is therefore trustworthy.
There's another mystery in House Dementia. Someone needs to write a book about that place. It'd be a best seller. Lots of intrigue!
Look. I don't like you. Why are you bothering me? Maybe I'll ask Syl to round you up for questioning. Would you like that? Go away.
So the spy says to her, "You're not paranoid if everyone's out to get you!" Ha! Like Syl! Paranoid! Ha!
I think that I would like to be tortured. Perhaps I should go see Syl.
Once again, Syl uses pain to get what she wants. How long before every one of us is forced to visit Herdir's chamber?
The Great Torch is out again! I bet you didn't know that!
The Great Torch is lit in the Sacellum Arden-Sul. Have you read the book about Arden-Sul? It's fascinating!
The Great Torch, the Great Torch! Why's everyone bothering me about that? I've got a Great Torch for you, right here.
So she says, "Is that a Great Torch in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" Ha!
There is no Great Torch. And it isn't ablaze once more.
The Torch lights the city once again. Fat lot of good it does those of use working out here.
The city isn't ruled by Dukes. It's ruled by elected representatives. And they wear funny hats.
A new ruler for Dementia! This is the stuff epic novels are made of.
There's a new Duke in the city? Who cares? Go kiss his ass, for all I care. Go on! Go!
So the new duke turns to him and says, "Wrecked him? Damn near killed him!"
Syl isn't dead. She's living on an island nearby.
With Syl gone, perhaps someone will help us out here.
Thadon isn't dead. He's just hiding.
Thadon is dead. Quite a tragedy. Perhaps someone will write about it.
Thadon's dead? So what? He annoyed me as much as you do.
...and he says, "Eat the Greenmote, drag Thadon. Eat the Greenmote, drag Thadon." Ha!
Thadon's not dead. He lives underground. In a house made of cheese.
With Thadon gone, perhaps someone will help us out here.
The Knights of Order are here to protect us.
Knights of Order? These aren't the valiant knights from the epic tales!
I wish those Knights of Order would come here and wipe everyone out. I'd finally get some piece and quiet!
Why did the Knights of Order cross the Fringe? No one knows.
These invaders that everyone is afraid of don't even exist. I swear, why would someone start a rumor to create panic?
Invaders? You don't... you don't suppose that they've come for ME do you?
The Gatekeeper is still dead. That's fine. He never did anything useful, anyway.
The Gatekeeper will keep out those adventurers again. Too bad. Some of them had exciting stories to tell.
When you're done boring me, why don't you go have a chat with the new Gatekeeper? Run along now!
So then Sorceress says to the new Gatekeeper, "But in the morning, you'll still be ugly!"
Did you hear? I helped rebuild the Gatekeeper! He has my eyes.... What? I got new ones!
Now that the Gatekeeper lives again, I have to ask... is he there to keep others out, or to keep us in? Think about it.
Those aren't Sheogorath's real armies that have returned. The real ones are being held in a secret underground compound.
Read your histories: a strong army guarantees a strong Realm. Good thing Sheogorath's armies are back to full strength.
I hear the army is restored. You should go see if they need a target dummy to practice on.
Do you know where Sheogorath keeps his armies? In his sleevies! Ah hahaha!
I hear that my army has been restored. Perhaps I should join up again....
People keep telling me that the armies of Sheogorath are reassembled... as if this is something that we should be happy about.
I know where Sheogorath is. He's hiding in my house. In a cupboard. But he's invisible.
Sheogorath has left. Where did he go? It's a mystery! I love mystery stories. I wonder how this one will end.
Maybe you're the reason Sheogorath left. Probably are. You make me want to leave whenever I see you.
Knock, knock. Who's there? Not Sheogorath.
I know where Sheogorath has gone! Of course, I'm not going to tell you.
Sheogorath has vanished? Another already seeks his throne. One tyrant passes and another rises. To the void with them.
We're all doomed. Jyggalag has won. Sheogorath is dead. The forces of Order are victorious.
We're all still here. It's a miracle! Someone really needs to write a book about this. Perhaps I should....
I suppose you think we should celebrate Jyggalag's defeat? The enemy of my enemy and all that? You're wrong.
What do you call the time between one victory dance and another? The Jig-lag! Get it?
Behold the new god of madness! It is I, Kishashi, who has defeated the forces of Jyggalag!
Don't think for a second that this war is actually over. Stay on your guard. The agents of the enemy lurk everywhere.
All the bards are busy composing songs about the battle! "The Fall of Dagon" is my favorite so far.
Have you heard "The Fall of Dagon" yet? "Take heart, the mighty hero cried! He looked up at Dagon and cursed his foul name..."
Still no news out of Aleswell since everybody vanished. Strange business.
Folks think we're all evil? What do they know? Do I look evil?
I tried the chapels. They're a waste of time.
Killing their chief should weaken the Black Bow Bandits, but they're still going to be a menace to travelers.
Una Armina runs a museum in Crucible.
The Imperial Watch seems awfully worried about the Gray Fox. Look at all those wanted posters.
I like the Two Sisters Lodge, and Mog does a good job running the place. She and her sister are both fine people.
That Else God-Hater sure has a chip on her shoulder. Great with a blade, but she really holds a grudge against the church.
Marie Palielle is quite a hard worker. She's in the chapel day and night, tending to the sick and injured.
I've heard some strange stories about Count Hassildor. I'm sure they couldn't be true, though.
Shum gro-Yarug is the butler in Castle Skingrad. Who ever heard of an Orc butler. Plus, he's in that "Orc Social Club." What a joke.
Ah-Malz at the Fighters Guild has gotten to be an expert on goblin hunting. He just hates the things.
I think Adrienne Berene is the ranking mage at the Mages Guild in town. Typical snooty mage.
If I were in the Mages Guild, I think I'd study Mysticism. Druja was telling me a bit about it, and it sounds interesting.
I've had about enough of Sir Lazare. He thinks he's so much better than everyone else.
Undena Orethi grows some good tomatoes. Yep. They sure are good tomatoes.
I think Bernadette Peneles seems like a nice woman. I know she works tirelessly over at the Tamika Vineyards.
Gaston Surilie and his brother Davide own one of the finest vineyards in all of Cyrodiil.
I enjoy the wines that Tamika makes at her vineyard. And they're reasonably priced, as well.
Wow. Palonirya is a tough negotiator. Hard to get her prices down.
Dul gro-Shug always seems at ease in light armor. He moves well in it.
I know that Dovyn Aren is getting up there in years, but he still knows a bit about Alteration.
I understand Mandil has some rather nimble fingers.
Samuel Bantien used to be able to pick any lock in the city. He's settled down now, though.
If you're an alchemist, The Main Ingredient is a good place to shop.
Rindir's Staffs is the best place in the city to buy a magical staff. Or is it Rindir's Staves....
If you're looking for a shield, Stonewall shields has a fine selection.
If you need money fast, try Jensine's. You can sell almost anything there.
You've gotta like a store named Slash 'N Smash.
There's some fine light armor at The Best Defense. Talk to Maro Rufus.
If you're looking for armor, you should speak with Tertia Viducia.
That Gruiand Garrana is really full of herself. She'll talk your ear off, if you let her.
That Ra'qanar seems a bit shady to me. He does a good job on the horses at the castle, though.
Ganredhel can teach you about Acrobatics, for a price. Of course, she'd rather be training her dogs.
Hafid Hollowleg says that Jerall View has been doing good business.
Cirroc is a good healer. He's a Redguard, but you'd think he was a Nord, the way he acts.
Apparently, Right-Wind teaches his blade skills to other Fighters Guild members.
Alga sure can tell a good story. I'm not normally a big fan of bard's tales, but she's got some good ones.
I've heard Edla Dark-Heart was once an assassin!
Gilgondrin inherited Silverhome from his parents. I understand he only runs it out of a sense of duty.
If you're looking to learn about conjuring creatures, you should try to speak with Fathis Aren.
Tadrose Helas teaches smithing at the Fighters Guild. Well, when she has the time.
Ita Rienus knows more about the geography of Tamriel than anyone I've ever met. Apparently, she knows quite a bit about Mysticism as well.
Varon Vamori can be really charming. Of course, there's something a bit odd about him as well.
Shuravi runs a good inn, but she's awful with her sisters.
I've heard Brodras at the Fighters Guild is well-versed in using heavy armor, especially for a wood elf.
Dagail has been training high ranking mages more about mysticism. And he's also been researching sheep, from what I hear.
The Count's Arms is a very nice place for a meal. And Wilbur has an extensive knowledge of wines.
Have you seen Rhano at the Fighters Guild use his sword? Impressive. He could teach us all a thing or two.
If you want to learn to use a mace, you should speak to Vigdis. Of course, to speak to Vigdis, you'll have to join the Fighters Guild.
If you're looking to learn a bit about potion-making, you should speak to Felen Ralas at the Mages Guild.
Mirabelle Monet runs quite a boarding house. I understand all of the sailors leave very satisfied.
Pinarus Inventius is quite the hunter. He can track about anything, and he's deadly with his bow.
Quill-Weave does a lot of traveling to research her books. She must have a lot of experience to share.
I've made you a little pumpkin bread... something to keep up your strength on those long night watches.
I've put aside a little mead for you. I know you like it.
The bread's hot and fresh, with a nice crust, and butter and honey, just like you like it.
It's been a long day. Quite pleasant to look forward to seeing you here.
I really must thank the one who recommended you -- and the Grey Mare. Always a splendid feast for my spirits. And the food is good, too.
After a long day up at the castle, it's refreshing to spend a time with someone as charming and thoughtful as you.
I get paid to kill things. That's why I like the Fighters Guild.
The local tavern is a good place to find work.
You know, Bongond has got some fine horses for sale over at the Grey Mare. Too bad he's such a pushy man.
Thank Stendarr for the chapel here in Chorrol. A lovely place, and the healers are excellent.
That Modryn Oreyn has got no sense of humor. Hell of a warrior, though. No wonder he's done so well in the Fighters Guild.
I've heard they have good magic trainers over at the Mages Guild.
I read one of Casta Scribonia's books not long ago. Terrible stuff, if you ask me. But, some folks seem to like it.
I think Rena Bruiant may actually love dogs more than her husband. Strange couple, those two.
You have to admit, this is a good place to live. Friendly folks, I think.
I just feel safe living here in Chorrol. I mean, we have the head of the Fighters Guild right here in town!
I'm thinking of doing some traveling. Just to see the world a bit.
How awful. An adventurer trying to get into our fine land? I hope they stay far from the palace.
I heard there's a new adventurer trying to get into the Shivering Isles. No real matter to me, unless he can build a boat.
Oh my! The Gatekeeper is dead! I must hurry back to Thadon's side. He must be protected!
Heard the Gatekeeper was killed. Waste of a creature that size anyway, if you ask me.
Oh thank goodness! The Resonator of Judgment has saved us!
I heard the Resonator of Judgment is working again. Can't say that it affects me much, so I'll just go about my business.
I'm so relieved that the Chalice is back in Lord Thadon's capable hands. He seems to be himself again.
Thadon seems upbeat again. I know how hard it is to get anything done when you're not feeling up to it.
Syl has tortured her courtiers again, I hear. Poor things.
I've no time for conspiracies. Get in the way, they do. Glad I wasn't involved at all.
When I heard the Great Torch atop the Sacellum was ignited, I literally jumped for joy. It's nice to feel safe for a change.
Too much to do. No time to talk about the Great Torch being relighted.
The Ritual is completed, and a new ruler presides over Dementia.
Even if you don't agree with the method, you have to respect the hard work it takes to replace a Duchess.
My master has partaken of the Greenmote and passed his post onto another. Now a new rule begins in the House of Mania.
Even if you don't agree with the method, you have to respect the hard work it takes to replace a Duke.
I've heard The Fringe has been attacked. I hope the residents were able to escape in time.
The Fringe has been destroyed. Who knows what could happen next? I'll have to work quickly to get my affairs in order.
Between the Gatekeeper and the Resonator of Judgment, I feel much safer in New Sheoth right now.
They can build a new Gatekeeper, but I can't manage to get anything done. I'm over-tasked, I tell you.
Lord Sheogorath's mood seems improved now that he has an army at his back.
Perhaps now that our guards are restored, things will quiet down and I'll actually be able to get something done.
Sheogorath may be gone, but I will still serve the House of Mania until my death.
Maybe it's not worth doing any more work. I mean, it certainly seems like we're all doomed. What's the point?
The Greymarch is complete and the House of Mania still stands tall.
Finally, all this mess is sorted out. I can get back to my work. Oh, I've lost so much time.
Any new entry to the Shivering Isles is the chance for a new convert. I welcome it.
The new arrival to our land has slain the Gatekeeper! A fine candidate for the Demented!
Once more the Isles are protected by the will of Arden-Sul.
Bah. I liked when Thadon was in a bad mood. Foolish Maniac.
Torture and pain abound in Crucible, glory be!
Once again, the Great Torch burns bright as Arden-Sul foretold.
The Ritual is complete. Arden-Sul's will is done.
Arden-Sul preserve us! The Fringe has been destroyed!
The Gatekeeper has returned to its former glory... Arden-Sul blesses us once more.
By the grace of Arden-Sul, the armies have returned.
Have we been forsaken? What has happened to Sheogorath? Arden-Sul, guide me in this time of need!
So, the story has been rewritten and the Greymarch is at a new ending. Arden-Sul's will be done.
Some new person has arrived. It'd be polite to introduce myself, but I'm feeling more tired than usual.
I've heard some new person has arrived in the Realm. I simply don't have the time to meet somebody new.
Any new adventurer trying to get into the Isles will have a tough time going up against the Gatekeeper.
The Gatekeeper is dead. Just great. Who's going to protect us now? I sure hope I don't have to move. I hate moving. It's depressing.
Whoever killed the Gatekeeper must have been dedicated and hard working. That reminds me... it's time I get back to work.
The Gatekeeper is dead. He's got really big bones.
Someone managed to turn the Resonator back on. I guess that's a good thing. Though it sounds like a lot of work for little pay off to me.
Glad they got the Resonator of Judgment turned back on. Was getting less done with all the hubbub about adventurers running amok.
That Resonator keeps adventurers trapped until they die. Lots of bones in there.
You know, I need to get me a habit like Thadon. Might take the edge off. Life can be so hard. Makes me want to cry all the time.
Thadon's got his cup back? Isn't that nice? I certainly can't lay around drifting on Felldew all day. I've got too many important things to do.
They say Thadon is addicted to some drug. I can understand what that's like. The bones call to me like his drug calls to him.
Syl likes torturing people, doesn't she? But, there's really no point in lying. I mean, it takes too much energy to keep it all straight.
I can't imagine how anyone can get anything done in Crucible, if they keep getting dragged off for questioning by Syl.
They round up people like animals in New Sheoth. I should hunt those nobles. That's what I should do.
I hear you light that big torch in the city by setting yourself on fire. Now there's an idea. I'd like to see that, but the city is so far away.
What do I care about a big torch in the city? I'm too busy to worry about the games of city-folk. A giant garden, that'd be something.
I've heard the Great Torch is lit once more. City dwellers. Such useless folk. I've got no use for them. A giant torch? Really?
Running Crucible must take a lot of energy. I'd rather just sit here. No reason to do anything else.
What do I care of the intrigues of the city? Old Duke, new Duke. I'm too busy to keep track of all that nonsense.
Someone new is running Crucible. Can't say I care.
Running Bliss must take a lot of energy. I'd rather just sit here. No reason to do anything else.
Someone new is running Bliss. Can't say I care.
Life might be easier if Order wipes everything out. Everything would be grey and plain. Like my life.
I hope those Knights of Order stay away from my garden. I'd hate to have to start all over again.
Damn Knights! Scaring away all the beasts!
They made a new Gatekeeper. I'd go see him, but that would take effort.
I'm glad the Gatekeeper is back. Lets me focus on my work.
A new Gatekeeper is in the Fringe now. That's good. Fewer adventurers means more creatures for me to hunt.
So we have armies again? I wouldn't want to be in an army. All that physical exertion. Better to just sit and regain your strength.
Sheogorath's army is restored? That's good. You learn discipline in the army, something folks around here are lacking.
The armies are back in order? I've got no use for armies. Killing is personal, not political.
Sheogorath's gone. I wish I could just disappear that way. Sometimes I feel invisible. But, that's not the same. I need a nap.
I guess even our Lord Sheogorath needs to take a vacation once in a while. Not me, though. I'm happy to keep working.
Even the great Lord Sheogorath forsakes us. The bones are getting louder.
I suppose I should be glad the world didn't end. But, in some ways, I wish it had. It would be easier than... this.
That was close, but Sheogorath has won. I'd better get back to work.
I'm glad Jyggalag is defeated. Can't imagine a grey world.
Hey, I don't like to tell stories, but Telaendril and me... you know. Don't believe me? I've got her undergarments to prove it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Black Brugo, chief of the Black Bow Bandits, is dead. And the Count made his killers Knights of the White Stallion.
The will-o-the-wisp is a luminous being. It has naturalized residences to many types of spells.
I am resident to encounter the minotaur. Its horny protuberants cause me great conflagrations.
Trolls, I have been foretold, are particular to unflammable weapons.
Though I am replicant to spread rumors, I am led to believe the philogy of skeletous beings makes them resistive to magic.
People are talking about a new adventurer who is seeking to get into the Isles. Mama warned me, "Only go where you've been invited."
The Gatekeeper is dead, you know. Now, that was a truly ugly creature. Perhaps now a handsome adventurer will come to steal me away.
Mama always said, "You catch more flies with honey than salt." Like that thing that sucks in the adventurers.
Thadon's in a much better mood lately. If he weren't so in love with the Felldew, I might invite him over to inspect my "wares" some time.
I hear something is amiss again in the House of Dementia. I wonder what it is. I love a good scandal. Don't you?
The Great Torch is lit. A romantic symbol, isn't it? I always hoped my first kiss would be in the glow of a torch.
Is the new ruler of Dementia lovely, I hope?
I can't believe Thadon is gone. He was a lovely man.
Souless Knights on the prowl, they say. Better carry a weapon with you. Wouldn't want you to get hurt.
I guess things will go back to normal now that there is a new Gatekeeper. Oh well, I was looking forward to some drama.
Those Golden Saint and Dark Seducer men are dreamy aren't they? Glad to have them back.
Where has Sheogorath gone? Mama always said, "The Prince of Madness is a basket of riddles."
Order has been defeated. I'm glad that's over. Mama always said, "The end of the world only happens once."
Someone new around? Not one of those horrible cats, I hope.
The Gatekeeper is dead? Who will keep out the cats? They'll be everywhere!
Again the Resonator pulls men to it. But cats? No! Why? It should draw them far from here!
Chalices? Who can think about chalices with the cat problem around here? Nasty beasts.
Torture in the House of Dementia? I'm constantly tortured! Cats everywhere.
I'm glad the Great Torch burns again. Cats hate fire.
Perhaps the new ruler of Dementia will do something about the cat problem.
A new ruler for Mania? Great. They don't have the same cat problems we have in Dementia.
The Fringe is under attack! Probably a cat conspiracy.
The new Gatekeeper will keep out those horrible Khajiit.
The armies of Sheogorath are renewed. Let them march now on the horrible cats! Wipe them from the Isles!
Where has Sheogorath gone? Who will save us from the cats? Won't someone think of the cats?
Order is defeated, but the cats still prey on us all.
There's someone new in the Realm. One more interloper to watch out for.
Don't hurt me, okay? Do you want a bone? I'll tell you a secret. They say a new adventurer has come. Don't bite me!
I hear a new puppy dog has arrived on the Isles. I bet he's really cute and cuddly. Like you!
With the Gatekeeper dead, there's one less line of defense against these damnable Scalons.
The Gatekeeper is dead. Did you kill him? You've got awfully sharp looking teeth. Don't eat me. Please!
Aren't you a cute little caterpillar! The Gatekeeper is dead. But he won't turn into a butterfly. No, he won't. Will he?
Resonator of Judgment is working again. Big deal; if it doesn't work on Scalons, doesn't do us a lick of good.
Yikes! To bad that Resonator of Judgment doesn't get rid of troublesome beasts. I bet you could swallow me whole, couldn't you?
The Resonator is attracting again. Aren't you a cute little thing? Do you want me to scratch behind your ears?
The Chalice of Reversal is back in Thadon's hands, I hear. Wonder if it could be used as a blunt weapon.
Did Thadon send you? Oh... I forgot he's happy again. Well, who sent you then? My word, your pinchers are huge! Stay back!
Oh, listen to you... a talking bird! How sweet. Did you know that Thadon's back to his old self? Fly away now! Be free!
Why can't they send someone here to torture the Scalons? More important than courtiers, if you ask me.
Ugh. Not again. Whatever Syl accused me of, I'm innocent. Don't hurt me. Wow, I've never seen such a big wolf before! Scary.
A little bird told me that Syl is rounding up people again. That's silly, isn't it? Would you like some milk, little kitty? You look thirsty.
So the Great Torch has been lit again. If it doesn't kill Scalons, it doesn't mean much to me.
Stay back! Where'd you come from? The big torch in the city? Back away, I say. Back!
Oh, what a pretty colored moth you are! Don't fly into the city. There's a big torch there. Bad news for little moths.
The lands of Dementia have a new ruler. Perhaps we'll finally take care of this Scalon problem once and for all.
Whoa, look at the fangs on you! There's a new ruler in Crucible. Don't bite me!
Horsey! Did you hear about the new ruler in Crucible? Did you? Good horsey.
Hmmm... perhaps the new ruler of Mania will take care of the Scalons.
Whoa, look at the fangs on you! There's a new ruler in Bliss. Don't bite me!
Horsey! Did you hear about the new ruler in Bliss? Did you? Good horsey.
The Fringe can fend for itself. We have our own problems.
Don't eat me! You're worse than those knights in the Fringe!
Those creatures in the Fringe are scary. Not like you, you fuzzy little rascal!
They can build a new Gatekeeper, but they can't send someone to aid me in fighting these Scalons?
You're more fearsome than the new Gatekeeper. Look at the teeth on you!
They built a new Gatekeeper! Yes they did. Yes they did. Aren't you just precious?
A whole army restored, and still these Scalons run free. Must I do everything myself?
Leave me alone. Sheogorath's armies are coming. You better run away!
The armies are restored, you say? My, what a smart little thing you are!
Perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the Scalons aren't the worst thing that could happen to us. I mean... Sheogorath himself has vanished.
I wish I could vanish like Sheogorath, right about now. Please don't hurt me.
Have you come to cheer me up? I'm worried about Lord Sheogorath. Are you worried, you little darling?
Fine, fine. So the Realm still stands. That doesn't mean there are any fewer Scalons in the Isles.
It seems the world is safe again... unless you're going to eat me. You're not going to eat me, are you? Are you? Please don't!
Look at you wag your tail! You're happy Jyggalag is gone too, aren't you? Yes you are! Yes you are!
They say that Akatosh appeared and killed Mehrunes Dagon, right in the middle of the Temple of the One! Do you believe it?
Between you and me? Ysabel is completely in love with me. But I'm just not a one-woman guy. Nope, the life of the bachelor suits me just fine...
Agronak is good, yeah. Too good. He says he's only half Orc. What I want to know is, what's the other half? Cause it sure ain't human...
I heard a rumor that you're an idiot. Any truth to that?
Shrines are secret for a reason. People hate us. Ignorant fools.
We don't want more worshippers. We just want to be left alone.
The assassinations. What else is there to talk about? Perfectly planned and executed... the Blades perfectly useless... a complete disaster.
Ugak has some good horses to sell. I sometimes can't tell her from her sister, though.
I need to head over to Colovian Traders and pick up a few things from Gunder. He's got a nice selection.
I went to the Chapel to get rid of a rash I'd picked up. Tumindil healed me right away.
I have no idea why Valandrus Abor even serves at the chapel. He's not very good, though you'd hear differently from him.
Dion takes his job as Guard Captain very seriously. He's all business when he's working.
I don't like that Danus Artellian. He's a bit stuck-up for my tastes.
Parwen is another one of those goblin hunters at the Fighters Guild. She's always talking about her "goblin killing tactics."
I saw Sulinus Vassinus at the Mages Guild conjure up some sort of creature, right there in the street. Guards took care of it.
Erthor is causing trouble at the Mages Guild again. Seems his experiments are always blowing up.
I've heard rumors that someone has been keeping a close eye on Toutius Sextius. Seems harmless enough.
Reman Broder is great with a bow. I think he could shoot the grapes off the vines, which is handy, since he works at the vineyard.
Uuras is a good shepherd, but his real love is cheese. Of course, there's no money in herding cheese.
Davide Surilie and his brother make some fine wines. It's a really impressive vineyard.
Old Glarthir is a bit out of his mind, I think. He's convinced everyone is out to get him.
If you go to the Fighting Chance, make sure to speak with Rohssan about repairing armor.
I have friends visiting soon, so I told them to stay at the King and Queen Tavern.
I saw Irene Metrick recently. She jumped clear over a table at the inn.
I understand that Othrelos isn't a bad man to talk to, if you need to learn how not to be seen.
If you want luxury, there's nowhere better than the Tiber Septim Hotel.
Phintias has the best bookstore in the city. Of course, First Edition is the only bookstore in the city.
Thoronir will buy almost anything. And I mean anything.
You'll never leave the Feed Bag on an empty stomach.
If you need something enchanted, Calindil has the goods.
The Gilded Carafe. A fine store with a terrible name.
If there's a complaint about a merchant, speak to Vinicia Melissaeia.
Dervera Romalen seems pleased that so many folks drink at the Newlands lodge. She takes great pride in it.
Mach-Na runs a good business. He's a grumpy old man, though.
I understand Hil the Tall will teach Alteration to anyone willing to pay.
I've heard that Naspia Cosma would rather be fighting in the Arena than spending time at the castle. She's excellent with a blade.
Deetsan must be the happiest Mages Guild member in all of Tamriel. I think it was always his dream to join.
The Tap and Tack is a good place to get a quick bite, and Olav is a good man.
Olfand really has his hands full with Skjorta. I don't know how he has time for business.
Apparently, Arentus Falvius at the chapel is quite a conjurer. He'll even teach the skill to those he likes.
I heard that J'skar at the Mages Guild is quite good at blowing things up.
Jantus Brolus is apparently an excellent mage.
The Five Claws Lodge is a nice, clean place. Witseidutsei makes sure of it.
I've heard Tun-Zeeus has some fine blades at the Dividing Line. Of course, he'll talk your ear off about them if you let him.
I like eating at the Flowing Bowl. Maenlorn runs a quality inn.
Azzan at the Fighters Guild is a fine warrior. I understand he can sign you up, if you're interested.
I saw Rufrius Vinicius knock a man down with one punch. I wish he'd teach me a bit about hand-to-hand combat.
I've heard Carahil is a powerful illusionist. No wonder she's the ranking mage here in Anvil.
March Gulitte is a dangerous one. He teaches mages about the Destruction school of magic.
Heinrich Oaken-Hull is married to a Bosmer? I suppose the women are less annoying than the men.
Something about Arvena Thelas is a bit odd. I've heard she keeps strange things in her basement.
I enjoy being in the Fighters Guild, though there haven't been quite as many contracts lately.
I sure am glad I don't live in Leyawiin. Too many foreigners.
I'm going over to Northern Goods and Trade. There's always something I need at that place.
Northern Goods and Trade is an excellent place to buy supplies.
I wanted to get a little practice in with my sword, so I headed to the Fighters Guild. Turns out you have to be a member to train there.
Eugal Belette is an odd one... and I swear I heard strange noises coming from his basement not long ago.
I'm sure you've heard that Glistel and Malintus Ancrus are living together. Simply shameful.
Ah, Chorrol. Easy access to all the other cities of Cyrodiil.
Don't know why anyone would visit the other cities of Cyrodill. Chorrol has it all. And a fairly low murder rate!
I understand the Fighters Guild is looking for new members. Seems a bit odd, but that's what I hear.
Another adventurer is trying to get into the Shivering Isles. If it's a Breton, it'll be the first one in 3.7 years.
Did you know that the Gatekeeper had only a three percent chance of failing? Most interesting that he was defeated.
I can't help but wonder what the percentage chance of the Resonator attracting a particular individual is. Riveting stuff, really.
With his Chalice returned, Thadon seems to smile at least four times as often. That's just an estimation, of course.
It takes an average of three attempts to inflict pain before someone will give up useful information, you know.
The Great Torch burns at a temperature 13 times hotter than the average fire.
There was a 21 percent chance that Dementia would get a new ruler.
There was only a 16 percent chance Thadon's heart would explode.
I heard the Fringe was attacked. I don't yet know exactly how many were lost, but I'll have to find out.
I understand there's a new Gatekeeper. Rebuilt much faster this time around, unless I'm mistaken. And I never am.
Good to see the armies back. Did you know that the average Saint is exactly six feet tall?
I'm rather curious about this disappearance of Sheogorath's. Is he incorporeal, invisible, or has he moved to another plane?
I lost track of the number of times I looked at the sky, waiting for the world to end.
The last thing the Realm needs is one more vagabond sneaking in.
The Gatekeeper is dead. One more sign that the Realm is being run into the ground. This never should've happened.
The Resonator was my idea, you know. People never remember that, but it was. I'm glad it's working again.
Thadon has one less excuse for his sloppy rule over Bliss, now that he has his Chalice again.
This is preposterous. Were I in charge, the culprits would've been found and executed immediately.
The Great Torch burning again is a sign that things aren't completely hopeless. Means someone is doing something right.
I no longer serve Lady Syl. Crucible has a new ruler.
Thadon is dead. Bliss will be even more of a mess than before.
I helped save the Fringe, you know. Not directly, really, but it was ultimately thanks to me.
Rebuilding the Gatekeeper is one of the few things that has gone right lately.
I'm not saying I couldn't do a better job, but at least someone is in charge who can get things done.
I can say without hesitation that none of this is my fault. Could've told you it was coming, though.
You know, of course, that the Realm would still be in jeopardy were it not for me.
Newcomers mean new pests. New pests mean more blood! More blood means a very busy Relan....
I'd like to see this new adventurer try to make it past the Gatekeeper.
Mighty warrior, the fallen Gatekeeper. Relan wonders if he would be able to do the same.
The Gatekeeper was killed. Nobody asked me if I thought that was a good idea. Well, I do.
People are talking about a Resonator. Unless it makes more pests to kill, Relan does not care.
Adventurers are being sucked up by that Xedilian place again.
Relan hears of this Reversal Chalice. It makes blood special, yes? Relan would like special blood.
Thadon has his Chalice back. Doesn't he know a good leader doesn't need any of that? Just his native intelligence. I would know.
Relan hears of Syl's torture. Relan likes what he hears. Syl is good.
Syl's really suspicious of other people. I bet she's the one with something to hide.
Relan understands the Great Torch burns again. Relan thinks this is a good sign.
Some fool lit himself on fire in the city.
Relan hears there's a new ruler in Crucible. Relan finds this interesting.
I bet I'd make a better Duke than the new one.
Relan hears there's a new ruler in Bliss. Relan finds this interesting.
Visit Passwall once, Relan did. Good that it burned. People there deserve pain.
Those Knights of Order are always causing trouble. Don't worry, though. I'll figure out what to do.
Relan is jealous of the Gatekeeper. Relan wishes that he had swords for arms.
The rebuilt the Gatekeeper. I thought they should have done that a long time ago.
Armies? Pah! Armies are worthless. Killing is best by one man alone. In the dark. Sneak. Sneak. Then blood.
The armies are back together now, I hear. I'd never have let them get lost in the first place.
The Madgod is gone. Can he die?
Sheogorath leaves in the middle of the Greymarch. Perhaps I should take over ruling the Realm.
Much blood has come and gone. Relan is sad. Relan was stuck in Fellmoor for all the war... no blood... no war... poor Relan.
Jyggalag's defeated. Took them long enough to get rid of him.
Oh, I shouldn't... well, all right. Gogron had a pet rabbit as a child! He petted the thing so hard he crushed its skull! Ha ha ha! What a brute!
Yes.  I mean ... I must go now.  But do accept my apologies for your loss.
I try not to burden myself with news of the current goings-on. It gets to be rather distasteful at times. Don't you think?
Fribble! Just Fribble!
How glorious, a newcomer to the Isles! Perhaps they will see the ways of Arden-Sul and join us.
Someone new comes to the Isles. Much more interesting than someone old.
There's someone new in town, I hear. Finally, someone with a wider perspective who can appreciate my art!
Arden-Sul has willed it to be... the Gatekeeper is dead and the newcomer to the Isles will join us in praising his name!
Gatekeeper's gone. For good. Or not. Might just be on holiday. We'll see.
I wonder...  now that the Gatekeeper is dead, perhaps my fame will finally spread far beyond the Shivering Isles!
The Resonator has been reactivated, and the Isles are no longer open to invasion. Arden-Sul works in mysterious ways.
The Resonator sings its sweet song once more. Promises of riches and fame, fulfilled with death and madness. How delightful.
I'm calling my new act "The Restoration of the Resonator." But, I don't think my public is ready for it yet. It's very cutting edge.
My heart fills with joy that Lord Thadon has finally recovered from his doldrums.
The Chalice is once again in its rightful place. And places are rightfully mine. And Chalices. Right?
Now that Duke Thadon's happy again, I'm sure he'll invite me to the palace to perform! Oh, who am I kidding....
It is a sad day in this fine city when the stench of torture poisons our spirits.
My, my, my. Seems we're all anxious to know something, even if we already know it. Or, Syl knows it. Or not.
Syl has gone on another one of her rampages in Crucible. I'm certainly glad I live on the right side of the wall.
May we all bask in the warm safe glow of the Great Torch.
A torch is lit. The light is lighted. Or lit. It's a Great Torch. Much better than most.
I'm working on a very unusual new juggling routine to commemorate the relighting of the Torch. But you'd probably hate it.
By the grace of Arden-Sul a new successor has been selected to rule. Joy to Arden-Sul and Maniacs!
I wonder if the new Duke of Dementia is a patron of the arts. Perhaps he will be more appreciative of my act than Lady Syl.
I'm so excited! I expect an invitation to perform at the installation of the new ruler of Mania any day now!
The Knights of Order have returned as foretold. Arden-Sul save us!
During these terrible times, I think people need juggling more than ever to take their minds off their troubles.
Arden-Sul has heard our plea, and delivered the Gatekeeper back to us. We're saved!
I'm working on a new act where I juggle arms and legs -- in honor of the new Gatekeeper, you see.
Armies restored or not, I will not let an enemy of the Maniacs set foot in the Sacellum.
I'll soon be unveiling an entirely new act. "Silence Over Brellach: A Juggling Epic." I think you'll agree it's my finest work.
Sheogorath has left us to think for ourselves and to turn to Arden-Sul's teachings for enlightenment.
All my patrons keep disappearing! It's impossible to create important art under these conditions!
Order has been destroyed and we still stand! Joy and tidings to all!
Art has triumphed! I plan to dedicate my next juggling epic to Sheogorath's glorious victory!
Newcomers are entering the Shivering Isles. With new people comes new treasure!
There's a new person in the Isles. I wonder what his blood tastes like?
Rumor has it there's another adventurer trying to get into the Realm. One more person to take up arms against me!
They're saying that the Gatekeeper has been killed. Was it you? Did you do it? Did you get anything good from him?
It's only a matter of time before adventurers swarm the Isles now that the Gatekeeper is killed. You'll need a sharp blade to bleed them.
The Gatekeeper's been killed. This is only the first step; they'll be coming for me next.
The Resonator is fixed again. What a shame. I looked forward to meeting new people. They always have such nice things.
I wonder if the Resonator of Judgment hurts those inside?
Lord Sheogorath would do well to stop bothering with the Resonator, and just send everyone away.
Thadon has his Chalice back. I wonder if he'll let me take a look at it....
Thadon's blood is so tainted. He needs to be cut open so he can let some of the toxin out.
Thadon and his Chalice can both rot in Hell, for all I care.
I once met Herdir after a misunderstanding about some candlesticks in Syl's great hall. He's not a bad fellow, actually.
Syl is a paranoid fool. She could torture me as much as she'd like, though. Cut intricate patterns into my skin. I shiver just thinking about it.
The conspiracy has been discovered and eliminated. That is all you need know.
The Torch is relit. Wonderful. Just makes it a bit tougher to sneak around.
I wonder if the Great Torch being lit will stop the unrest. I was getting excited about the prospect of more bloodshed. Oh, well.
The Torch burns again. This can't bode well.
It's a shame Syl's gone. She didn't pay a lot of attention to what was going on.
A new ruler for Dementia! Perhaps blood was spilled. Great deals of blood. Syl's blood. Lovely blood.
Thadon gone.... I wonder if his quarters are still guarded.
I heard Thadon's heart exploded. There would have been a great deal of blood. Sweet, sweet heart's blood.
Did you hear? The Fringe was attacked! How horrible!
Strange creatures have appeared in the Fringe... perhaps you need a new blade? A Madness blade?
The Gatekeeper has been rebuilt. I wonder if I could get a little piece of the old one.
I've heard that the new Gatekeeper is fearsome. The ground will soon be red with the blood of those that would challenge him.
The armies of Sheogorath march again!
Our Lord has His armies restored. They carry such wonderfully sharp blades.
Sheogorath is gone? If he is gone, then who is watching us?
Sheogorath is gone. Better carry a blade, just in case. Use it on your enemies, if things get bad. Or on yourself, if things get worse.
Do you know the best part about the end of a war? Picking the bodies clean of their treasure.
I thought we were all doomed for a while there. I carved my last will and testament, but I won't say where.
A new person in town? Maybe someone to talk to on long, sleepless nights.
Business isn't going to be the same, now that anyone can just wander into the Isles.
The Resonator of Judgment is working again. I guess, since the Gatekeeper's dead now, that's a good thing.
I wonder if people dream when they take Felldew. Hmmm.
If you go to New Sheoth, beware. Syl has been rounding people up and asking them strange questions.
Maybe I should get a Great Torch like in New Sheoth. I'll bet it would help keep me awake.
A new ruler in Crucible? One more thing to keep me up at night.
Thadon is dead? I had a nightmare about that once.
It's worse than my nightmares! In fact, it's like my worst nightmares come true!
The new Gatekeeper will keep more adventurers in the Fringe. More business for my inn.
The armies have returned. Thank the Madgod! I've had nightmares about them disappearing.
Sheogorath has disappeared. This is worse than my nightmares.
The forces Order have been defeated. Perhaps now I can sleep.
Goodbye.
See you later.
Take care.
See you.
Bye.
It was so nice chatting with you. Be sure to let me know how your hunt for the Mythic Dawn turns out.
I'll keep studying the first two volumes of the "Commentaries." Who knows, I might turn up something before you do!
The first words of each paragraph are the key, I'm sure of it! Well, I shouldn't keep you. Goodbye.
I've half a mind to go down to Green Emperor Way myself and see what's there ... Well, good luck! I hope you find what you're looking for.
Sithis be with you, Sister.
Sithis be with you, Brother.
Walk always in the Shadow of Sithis.
Walk with darkness, child of the Night Mother.
Pathetic Blue Team Coward!
May shadow hide you.
Let's go.
Safe journey.
You should get back to work.
What a waste of my talents.
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Go ahead. Leave me to rot in here.
Outta my way.
You have done the right thing. Thank you.
Make haste. I wish to be rid of Earana as soon as possible.
Finding that book should be your top priority, Associate.
Get that staff back, Associate.
Make sure Varon hands over that staff.
Be careful, Associate.
Good luck finding Erthor.
Make them leave! Now!
Make them go away!
You will pay for this.
Please. Help us.
Peryite guide your actions.
Precious order to you.
An honor to serve you, my lady.
An honor to serve you, my lord.
I'm sure we'll speak again.
Farewell.
Be well, and live free.
Go to it.
Go hurt something.
Join the Guild. You won't regret it.
Training, beds, and good hard work. Can't beat it.
Farewell, Star-Bearer.
Go with our blessing, Goldbrand.
Good hunting, Hide-Wearer.
Farewell, Spellbreaker.
Drunk with madness! Madness for all!
You stand on holy ground.
Do not test His patience.
We tremble beneath His eye.
We serve Her will.
Her eye is upon you.
I'll be here.
Go carefully.
Go, then...
Remember... this place is sacred.
We watch and wait.
May the Night Mother guide you.
Sometimes I think Lachance will let anyone into this Sanctuary...
Go now, dear family member, and may the Night Mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace.
May you walk always in the shadow of Sithis, dear Brother.
May you walk always in the shadow of Sithis, dear Sister.
May Sithis be with you.
You befoul the very air with your presence. Begone!
Please hurry back.  You're my only hope!
Let's get out of this place!
I hope you have a plan to get us out of here.
Be ever vigilant, vampires are creatures of deceit.
Good journey.
Please, you must speak with Henantier. He has the reward I offered.
Now is a time for sleep. How I wish I could go with you!
Don't take this sojourn lightly. The recesses of the mind can be the darkest place of all.
My poor Henantier. Help will be with you soon.
Just this way.
Please, return quickly.
Please, I'm in desperate need of help, and I think you're the only one that I can turn to!
I do hope our paths cross again.
Farewell!
I was never good at saying goodbye.
Come back for a drink!
Goodbye. And watch yourself.
Songs of forks follow you.
Pleasant dreams.
Gotta run.
Stay safe.
Shadow hide you.
Blessings of Julianos upon ye.
Blessings of Akatosh upon ye.
Blessings of the Shadow upon ye.
Blessings of Anu upon ye.
Blessings of Mystara upon ye.
Blessings of Arkay upon ye.
Blessings of Stendarr upon ye.
Protect my little ones, Lord.
We are safe in your presence, Lord. Thank you.
Happy Big Head for having spoken to Lord Sheogorath!
Please, visit any time, My Lord.
Good seeing you, Lord Sheogorath. Could have bought a round, though....
Even Sheogorath won't help me.
There's no need to be that way. Goodbye.
Never mind, then.
Oh. If that's the way you feel.
Fine. Be that way.
Oh. Sorry to bother you.
ABOVE HERE ARE RESPONSES TO LOW DISPOSITION GOODBYES
'Bye.
You, too.
Good day.
Be seeing you.
Enough talk.
I'm through talking to you.
Stop talking.
Stop talking! Enough!
Just go away!
Go bother someone else.
I'm done talking to you.
Just leave.
So long.
Safe travels.
Good night.
I have no more to say to you!
Go away, fool!
You should rendezvous with Captain Burd immediately. The sooner that gate is closed the better.
It won't matter. Lord Dagon will soon be able to cross over. The Master's plan will have succeeded.
At least Anaxes isn't here to torment us anymore.
Watch out for Anaxes. Some meddling fool must have let him loose.
Some of the new ones say that the war is going badly. The attack on Bruma failed completely.
I don't believe we'll escape here even if Dagon's invasion succeeds. We'll be the Master's playthings forever.
We'll speak again soon, no doubt.
Leave me in peace.
I will send word to the Countess at once of the danger to Bruma. You should speak to Martin about his progress with the Xarxes.
The plans you found make it clear that the Mythic Dawn will soon move against us here. You must eliminate their agents in Bruma.
I'm counting on you to eliminate those spies. We can't afford to let the Mythic Dawn operate out of Bruma with impunity.
Let me know when you have found and eliminated the Mythic Dawn agents in Bruma.
Give my warm regards to Baurus. Tell him he should not blame himself for the Emperor's death. He did well to send you to me.
Yes, Cyrus. This is the Emperor's son, Martin Septim.
Be careful. There may be more of them about.
We should get moving. I won't rest easy until Martin is safe at Cloud Ruler Temple.
Waste no time. You must find Martin before the enemy does.
You should speak to the rulers of Cyrodiil as soon as possible. The danger to Bruma is growing by the day.
Keep your heart true... and your eyes open.
May Uriel's spirit guide us in these troubled times.
May your sword always strike true.
I thank you again for speaking with me, my lord. I'll leave you alone now. I know you're very busy. Until next time.
Well, I've kept you long enough, my lord. Remember that I'm here if you need anything.
I'm sorry, sir, I've been rambling on like an excitable child! I can only imagine how busy you must be. With your blessing, I will now take my leave.
I'm at your service, my lord.
May Talos guide you, my friend.
May Talos guide you.
Have a good day now.
Very good, then. I'll get right on it.
Farewell, magister. May your spells never falter.
Until later, then.
I'll take my leave of you then, fellow magister.
With your permission, I take my leave of you now, Scholar.
When I know more, I'll come find you.
I shall await further summons. No doubt you will have need of me.
Farewell, Your Grace.
Come see me when you've spoken to Jeanne.
Secure those artifacts before it's too late.
Make haste. Mucianus is in danger.
Count Hassildor awaits your arrival.
Quickly, hurry to Silorn while there's still time.
I'm... I'm still alive!
Please come find me as soon as you've located J'skar.
Good luck, Associate.
Have Erthor see me when he gets back, Associate.
Come back any time!
These break-ins must stop.
I'll never forget this.
I'm so grateful.
You're my only hope.
Enjoy your stay here.
Stay as long as you like.
You'd be smart to stay with the rest of the group. It's just not safe to go wandering off alone with a killer on the loose.
Stay safe... if that's even possible.
Don't go far. It's too dangerous to go wandering around this house.
Where are you going? What are you doing? We need to keep our eyes on each other!
This is insane. We're being hunted down one by one. There must be a way out of this madhouse!
Why? What drove you to this madness?
How could you do that to all those innocent people? What did they ever do to you?
So I guess this is it then?
All right then, I guess I'd better start looking. That gold's not going to find itself!
I have a good idea where that chest might be. That gold is as good as mine.
Hmm? Oh, yes, maybe we'll speak again later.
I shall never forget the talk we had. Your very presence in the Sanctuary is a blessing from the Dread Father himself!
If you ever have need of my abilities, dear Listener, just say the word.
May the Night Mother always watch over you, great Listener.
May the Lady guide your steps.
Do run along.
Pleasant, as always.
Don't forget who your friends are, or they may just become your enemy.
Take heed the knife that strikes from behind.
Keep the Ring safe.
The Ring guides us all.
Keep the Key safe.
Farewell, Brother.
Farewell, Sister.
Spill some blood for me, dear Brother.
Spill some blood for me, dear Sister.
Blech! I would not feed on you if you were the last warm body in Tamriel!
I'll be seeing you, then.
Good luck, Sister! I hope you don't get killed! I mean, um... well, you know!
Good luck, Brother! I hope you don't get killed! I mean, um... well, you know!
Just go! I can't stand the sight of you!
May you always walk in the shadow of death.
Please, I'm an old man! Just leave me be!
Shove off.
Uh-huh. Whatever you say.
Come see me anytime, friend. I'm here day or night.
Travel safe. Raynil wouldn't think twice about harming you.
I know I sound desperate, but I know I'm right.
Oh Bradon, you fool...
Aloys, Callia! He's cleared the goblins from Cropsford for us! It's safe for us to build the settlement!
Aloys, Callia! She's cleared the goblins from Cropsford for us! It's safe for us to build the settlement!
Take care, friend. Don't get yourself killed on our account.
Try not to worry so much, dear.
If you come across any unusual ingredients in your travels, be sure to remember me and bring them here.
Please, visit me again anytime. I'm glad to help. Give S'drassa my regards.
I'll see you in the Imperial City.
Remain leery of Seridur, he's much more cunning than you may suspect.
I appreciate your forebearance.
Please, stay your hand.
Go in peace.
Farewell, and be careful, Kurdan is not to be trusted.
Hurry, get that key... it's our only way out.
Kurdan is treacherous... be wary, friend.
Hear me out before you leave.
Release me...
You're really pushing it. Just keep disturbing me.
What's the hold up? I don't have all day.
Piss off.
Think carefully about what I told you! But I'm sure you'll be fine!
Remember. Read "The Cleansing of the Fane" before deciding whether to seek for Umbacano's treasure.
Take care, father.
Goodbye, darling.
Fear not, our paths may cross again.
This reunion will be the happiest day of my life.
Good day to you.
Brother? Wow... hope he's got a wine cellar!
Impersonate ME will you? Ha! There's only one... ummm... ahhh... what was my name again? Oh, yes... only one Reynald.
Say, could you pour me another? I seem to have run dry...
Guilbert was always the brains, but I've got the brawn! If you need anything, he can help you!
At long last, it's good to stand at Weatherleah again.
Lead on!
Please hurry, we are anxious to return home.
Please avenge my family's death... slay the ogres.
Keep to it, I have faith in you.
Be careful. I don't know what dangers may lurk in the Great Forest.
Farewell then.
Until we meet again.
May Mara guide you in your travels.
I've better things to do than waste time speaking with you.
Remorse? Ha!
Justice has been done.
Greed is unbecoming.
Honor suits you well. May your journeys always be safe.
Fetcher.
May the sunlight always safeguard your path.
You will be included in my prayers forever. May the Divines smile upon you.
Come back and visit me anytime.
Exhausted Mine is not far to the southeast. Be careful, its many twists and turns hide the Goblin hordes.
Please, don't go. You may be my only hope.
Twelve more... Twelve! I was so close!
Yessir, no more fish for me. Just long peaceful days ahead for ol' Aelwin Merowald.
Damn bears... going to run me out of Shardrock at this rate.
Ah well, perhaps you can return to help another time.
Farewell, my friend!
Hurry! There's no telling how much time I have left!
Leaving me to die in peace, eh?
I love you, Pyke.
I really must get back to my paintings.
Remember, walk lightly, and always look up.
I live to serve.
My work is never done.
A glorious existence. Truly.
If only we could speak more often.
Enlightening, as always.
Take care. Wish I could.
Goodbye for now.
I really wish they would stop yelling.
Somebody stop that awful racket!
Doesn't that noise bother anyone else?
It's been a great bounty being in Your Presence. Where'd all those trumpets come from?
May your walls stand secure!
I hope I live to speak with you again, Lord Sheogorath.
Farewell. Stay safe.
The time of Preparation is almost over.
The time of Cleansing is at hand, praise be.
Go and prepare yourself. The Master will have need of all of us soon.
Farewell, my friend. May your blade always strike true. And first. He he.
We'll speak again later, Apprentice. Now go! Your studies await!
Away with you dog, and fetch me those components.
Don't take all day making your choices.
Get going, and don't keep me waiting.
Run along back to Lord Sheogorath.
I hope you both get mindrot!
I'm leaving now.
No sir. Please don't hurt me.
Think about that offer, friend.
Tell Ardaline I'm sorry.
You're staring at me again.
Stop staring at me. Let's get to work.
Time's wasting.
Don't just stand there. Move.
I'll be waiting.
Oh, the poor little rats!
Oh, my rats are so cute!
Please, go find Pinarus, and those mountain lions!
Please save my little rats!
Yes, Master. Whatever you say.
Tell her right away.
Finish it.
We've got to stop them.
I'll wait here.
Keep moving.
Good luck.
Good work.
Make him sing.
Go get him.
We'll get through this.
You can do it.
We'll be talking.
We'll show them.
I'm relying on you.
Later.
What a pity.
Be careful.
Walk where your road must take you.
Malacath, have mercy!
May Malacath forgive us for what we've done.
Praise be to the Lord Molag Bal.
Her song guides us.
Who will guide us, now that she is gone?
Her light shall show you the way.
Light guide you, brother.
Light guide you, sister.
I won't go back! You can't make me go back!
Hasten back to the palace... Sheogorath must know!
Not to worry, we'll have your spoils to you in no time at all.
One more room to go.
Hurry, there's no telling how much damage has already been dealt to the Resonator!
You're doing quite well so far... keep it up!
So good to be back in business!
Please, I have much to tell you. Don't go.
Any time you wish to visit me, I'll be here.
How I look forward to our goodbyes.
I really do loathe talking to you.
Talking with you leaves such a nasty taste in my mouth. And not the good kind.
Until next time.
Saying goodbye is like ripping out a little piece of yourself. Ahhh.
Run along now, see you later.
Stay with it.
May your Blade show the way.
Smash the foe, Mace-Bearer.
True dreaming, Skull-Bearer.
I have things to do.
Sithis be with you.
Ahhh... Rosentia will be so pleased!
Please, get those things out of here.
Send Rosentia my regards. If there's anything else I can do, please let me know!
May all your travels be safe.
Vampires are clever, so watch your back.
Gilen and his silly games...
Again, I thank you.
I will follow.
Follow me.
Please hurry.
Be cautious, friend.
S'wit of a thief.
A thousand thanks to you.
I must see Rythe.
Do be careful.
Who will help me?
I await your decision.
Make sure you address the Count properly.
It's good to be home.
The path is yours; lead on.
Wait... I have much to tell you!
Well, come on, let's get movin'.
Goodbye... fare-thee-well... hic.
You must bring that evidence to Garrus. Make haste.
Go. Tell Garrus what I've done. I've nothing to hide.
Stand fast, this isn't going to be pleasant.
Don't tarry... get Ulrich here soon before he changes his mind.
Ulrich will not buy his way out of this one... he'll pay, I promise you.
Garrus may be our only hope.
Our transaction is complete. I trust you'll keep this between us, yes?
Good deeds and moral fiber. Bah!
Either you have it, or you don't. Don't play games with me.
Beware. The Redguard Valley Ogres are not known for their... hospitality.
You shouldn't pass on golden opportunities.
Now, to find another drink...
Some other time maybe.
Farewell, serjo.
Goodbye, Knight. Remember to carry our symbol proudly as a beacon of hope for all Cyrodiil!
Safe journey, serjo.
Safe travels, muthsera.
Return anytime.
You will remember the day you met Farwil Indarys and treasure every moment after.
A little stab in the back won't hurt too much. Then I'll have the magicka I need.
Ugh! These welkynd stones taste terrible.
I'm short on patience as well as magicka. Out of my way! Once I regain my power, I'll show you.
Farewell. So much to bake, so little time!
Goodbye. If you find any interesting things, let me know.
I'm glad that's over. You've kept me from my work long enough.
Keep an eye out for them.
I need a bath.
Don't touch anything!
Does the air seem thicker than normal?
Has that mouth of yours stopped flapping? Good.
Saying goodbye is my favorite part of talking to you.
Don't bother me again.
Hurry back, my Lord. There's so much I want to show you. So much, indeed!
I'm glad that's over. I have work to do.
It has been an honor speaking with you.
We must purge Order from our home.
We shall not fail you.
We must prevail.
Please, your Grace. Hurry to Pinnacle Rock while there's still time.
We will defend this land until we are dead.
Victory or death.
Vengeance will be ours.
So long as we breathe, the Fringe will hold.
We will not lose this land.
For Sheogorath's glory.
We are vigilant.
We will continue to hold the Fringe.
Walk with Our Lord.
You bless me, Lord.
We live at your whim, Lord Sheogorath.
Please, your Grace. Hurry to Brellach while there's still time.
Go.
The Aureal stand at the ready, sire.
The Aureal are yours to command.
As you command, sire. Guards! Form up and protect the Emperor! To the Temple of the One!
The dragon will stand forever as a memorial to what you and Martin did for all of Tamriel.
Any time, Champion.
Please excuse me. I have things to attend to.
Go with the grace of the Nine.
I think I hear milady calling.
I shall have your reward soon.
Remember, not a word to Teekeeus!
Don't forget: be down here at 10 PM. I'll see you then.
Don't forget: the living quarters at 10 PM. I'll see you there.
Let me know when you're done with that little task.
Be careful out there, friend.
Find someone else to bother, won't you?
Next time, on time, please.
I'll be waiting right here.
Thanks again.
Stay close, please.
Sweet!
Ready for action!
I'm waiting.
Oh, hey, yeah. Yeah, I'll talk to you... Later? Yeah, later.
Hmm? Oh, yes, goodbye...
Remember, I will be expecting you at Nenalata in three days time.
May the Night Mother hold you in her cold embrace.
Under your leadership, the Black Hand will reign eternal!
The only piece of advice I can give you is to leave no stone unturned. Good luck!
This will be my greatest achievement yet.
It's quite possible you may find Nirnroot in people's homes or businesses. Not everyone knows its true potential.
Now was it Mandrake Root first, then the Void Salts, or the other way around. Hmmm....
Nirnroot doesn't need sunlight to thrive. Don't forget to check underground as well.
Now where did I put that pestle?
Remember, always look near water. That's the best place to find Nirnroot.
See you in 24 hours.
Be careful in Shadeleaf Copse. No telling what else resides there besides the Nirnroot.
I don't recommend leaving before I've had a chance to offer you more information on your potential reward, although I admire your zeal.
Come back anytime.
Good to be home.
Please... go get some rest.
Good riddance.
She's lucky I didn't have her tossed overboard.
Please... get her from my sight.
Don't leave me!
I'll drain you until you live no more!
Who knows when Roland may strike again? You must hurry.
There's more to tell.
This way.
Finally... back to the real world.
If you have something to show me, then show me...
Elements... Dreamworld... HA! That's the best yarn I've heard in years!
Please, help me find what I've lost.
Farewell, friend.
Until our paths cross again...
Farewell, my friend.
Keep yourself safe, my friend.
Remember me if you find more Shadowbanish Wine!
All manner of creatures infest Bramblepoint Cave, you must remain vigilant.
What am I to do? I'll never be able to re-enter that cave alone.
Keep looking for that wine! Farewell!
Have a fine journey, and keep yourself safe.
Please, come back soon. No telling what oddities I may have for you next time.
Got to go. Have things to see and people to do.
It's time to say goodbye, I'm sorry I must fly.
If you hear anything interesting, let me know.
I'd like to return to my work, if that's alright with you.
I'll see you soon! Or maybe I'll see you later... I can never remember...
Very well. Let's finish this.
Let's continue on to the Elder Council Chambers.
Be patient. Lord Dagon's victory is only a matter of time now, and then we will return to Tamriel in triumph.
Those who despair will certainly never be permitted to leave the Eternal Garden.
The Eternal Garden is the testing ground for the new rulers of Tamriel. I intend to pass the Master's test.
The Master will soon deal with you.
Be careful, my friend. I know you have braved many dangers already, but Miscarcand is not to be taken lightly.
I should have the final part of the ritual deciphered soon. It's only a matter of time now.
I think I'm close to deciphering more of the ritual. I hope to have made some progress by the time you return with a daedric artifact.
I'm still working on the second item needed for the gate-opening ritual. I believe I'm close to deciphering the relevant passage.
I hope to have at least part of the Mysterium Xarxes translated in a few days. Speak to Jauffre about those spies in the meantime.
I'm working as quickly I can. The Xarxes doesn't give up its secrets easily.
Don't worry about me, my friend. I know I'm in good hands here.
We'd better find Jauffre.
Come back with help. I don't know how much longer we can hold out in here.
Be sure to speak to Jauffre about the Armor of Tiber Septim. I'll continue my study of the Mysterium Xarxes.
Good luck, my friend. Don't take any unnecessary risks.
Thank you again for your kind words. Now please, don't let me keep you. We'll speak again later.
Just remember, we're in this together. You must learn to rely on me as I rely on you. But I've rambled on long enough. Akatosh be with you.
My heart is lighter thanks to your words. You've given me kinship, and that is worth more than a thousand swords. Until later, friend.
Don't let me keep you.
Captain. No news is good news, I hope.
Baurus, good to see you.
Jena, always a pleasure.
Caroline, a good day to you. Or is it evening?
Cyrus, my friend. Don't let me keep you.
All's well, I hope, Jauffre?
Roliand, thank you.
Belisarius, thank you.
Carry on.
I have many questions about all this. I hope Jauffre will be able to answer them.
Go with Akatosh.
Well, what are you waiting for? Get!
Humph.
Report back as soon as you can.
Be careful, and watch your step.
This is kind of exciting, don't you think?
Be careful. Some things in here don't react well to magic.
I eagerly await your return.
Good luck with Irlav's project.
Irlav should be waiting for you.
You shall have a true Mages' Staff soon.
No sign of him.
Nothing so far.
Don't worry, we'll get him.
Yes I can. You are under arrest for the theft of the bust of Llathasa Indarys, Countess of Cheydinhal. Come with me.
Return to your guild, and prepare yourself accordingly.
I shall await your return.
You best be careful around here.
I have to get back to work now.
Move along.
Farewell, Arch-Mage.
Hmmph.
I'll leave at once for Anvil.
You are dismissed.
The moths are almost done spinning.
Stay sharp, Associate.
I'm here to help, if you need me.
Thanks for the help.
I'm with you.
Much obliged, my friend.
We're done here.
Can't you take a hint?
Better go talk to ol' Arvena.
Let's go hunting.
Let me know if you need my help.
Goodbye, dearie.
Oh, go away! Shoo, shoo!
Wonderful. People are dropping dead and I'm trapped here looking for gold I don't even need! I'll be happy just to find the key and get out of here!
Just leave me. Please.
We shall find a way to the light.
I'd steer clear, citizen.
Leave me alone. I'm just trying to work here.
You're in charge now.
Just do your job.
Sithis is Master! All hail the Dread Father!
Go now! Learn the identity of the betrayer so we can end this madness, and restore the authority of the Black Hand.
Your path is clear. Send Rufio to his death, and the Dark Brotherhood will embrace you as family.
You are now one with the Dark Brotherhood. Visit Ocheeva at the Cheydinhal Sanctuary and your new life will begin.
Make haste! The Sanctuary must be Purified, if this treachery is to be undone!
Go now, Child of Sithis. Walk in the shadow of fear, and bring glory to our Dread Father.
You take care now, buddy.
Next time, go someplace else, huh? The Inn of Ill Omen, the Tiber Septim Hotel... Anywhere but here, okay?
Move along, citizen. I won't abide loitering.
Aren't you forgetting to tell me something?
My prayers go with you.
Darkfathom Cave isn't that far from here, but the route may be treacherous. Be careful, and journey safe.
Please, consider my proposal. The reward will be worth the risk.
Alves is a practiced researcher... she's sure to have some good information for you.
If you change your mind, I'm certainly not going anywhere.
Whatever am I to do?
Remember, 11 in the evening. Don't disappoint me.
Drink up and eat something. You'll need your strength.
This is going to be fun.
Please hurry, we must know of Raynil's whereabouts.
Please hurry, Raynil may make a break for the open road at any moment.
I must hurry, excuse me.
Keep up the... ummm... good work, I suppose.
Feel free to question anyone in town, they shouldn't give you too much trouble.
Good luck, investigator.
Fare thee well.
Come on! For Kvatch!
Be quick about it. This is our best chance to rescue the survivors from the Chapel.
Good luck. It's a brave thing you're doing.
Hurry back.
Hurry! There's no time!
I'm running out of patience with Barthel.
Good luck, stranger. You get that girl out of this terrible place.
Leave me be.
Victory is yours.
Good luck with Itius.
I hope your witnesses are willing to come forward.
Let's go home.
This battle is not over!
The farm is near. Stay close.
Come back as quickly as you can.
We must go.
We will spill their blood in the name of our father!
Hurry up, will you?
Hmph.
Hurry, get to Weynon Priory.
Good luck to you.
Oh, my sons. My poor sons. Who will help them now?
You should hasten to Castle Cheydinhal.
I never want to see one of those gates again.
We should continue for Farwil's sake.
Let's keep moving.
Please help us.
Count Indarys is waiting.
This day will be remembered.
Tread carefully; I don't know what evil lurks within that gate.
Brash child. Now look what he's gotten himself into.
Two days and nary a word. I fear the worst.
Return when you have the Madstone.
May the path ahead be free of danger.
I'm disappointed. But you'll be back.
Please consider my proposal.
Just speak to Tolgan... you'll see.
May the Divines smile upon you.
Gotta run!
As soon as this opens, I'm leaving.
Did you hear a noise?
Let's be done with this.
I'll see you in Anvil.
Congratulations on your buy!
Enjoy the manor.
Don't wait too long to decide.
Move along please.
We finally got him! There'll be no excuses this time. Ulrich is mine.
I really wish you had followed my advice.
Aldos's death is indeed a tragedy. We'll do what we can to put his soul at ease.
You must locate Aldos. He's a danger to himself and others in his condition.
Do I have to think of everything?
I warn you... don't cross me.
Acquire a taste for rat stew while you were in there? Hehe.
He's not likely to just come out and tell you, so get creative!
You'll be back...
Filthy convict scum.
Leave me.
Remember. A knight's title shall be your reward.
Prompt attention to this matter will be rewarded.
Good day, Sir Knight.
Good fortune to you.
Send a moron to do a man's job...
Excuse me.
Until we meet again, may your travels be safe and the road remain clear.
Have you ever considered a job in law enforcement? Hehehe.
May luck be always on your side.
Good journey to you.
Farewell, and may you find your way home safely each night to a warm fire.
If you'll excuse me, I'm off to Leyawiin Castle to check in and then the Imperial City for some rest and relaxation.
Be vigilant. Lonavo is a snake.
Hmph. Suit yourself.
Well then, it's back to the open road for us, eh? Stay safe, my friend. And stay clear of those Goblins. Little buggers have been getting cocky...
All right. The pickpockets and pilferers ain't going to catch themselves. We'd best be off.
Hey, did you hear that? Thought I heard someone calling for a guard. I guess that's our cue.
Well, I should go. If you need any backup, just give me a shout.
We'd best get back to work now, hmm? Captain catches us gabbin', it'll be our heads.
Just remember, my sword's here if you need it. You run into any trouble, just holler.
Back to the watch then, eh? Don't forget to stop by the barracks later. I'll show you those new greaves. The Mithril ones. Until then...
She would want me to die well.
My betrothed must be worried sick about me.
Goodbye, magister.
It was an honor to speak with you, Champion.
Stay safe, citizen. These are dark times....
If you run into trouble, come find me.
Long live the Empire!
Move along, you worthless filth.
Keep moving, scum.
Farewell, citizen.
Go kill something, so I can count its corpse.
8, 9, 10.
Kill me... please!
Skooma! Skooma!
Next time, bring some Skooma with you!
Excuse me. I see something I need to clean.
Take care now!
Shh.  Not in front of the stranger.
We'll talk later tonight at the gathering.
See ya.
12... uh... 6? 4?
If you kill something, let me know!
Perhaps my Lord will grant me my wish.
Blessings upon you Lord.... Bring the Skooma next time.
You honor me with your presence.
It's been an honor to host you, Lord Sheogorath.
I'm getting to safety; you should too!
It's not safe here! Leave before he comes back!
Shadow hide the hunter.
Good hunting.
Swift hunting.
Go ahead. I don't care.
Great fortunes to you.
Gods protect us!
Doomed! We're all doomed!
Too much. Too much.
May the Masque protect you.
Reach for glory, Rose-Bearer.
Foul-smelling ape...
Away from me, housecat! Look at that fur. What a disgrace...
Until we meet again, my dear friend!
Move faster, if you value your life.
I'm glad you're back in one piece.
It appears you're well prepared. Good luck.
Stay warm, my friend.
To think, all the information I needed was in a simple tome. Ah well...
Keep me informed.
Bring my salutations to Julienne. Safe journey to you.
I assure you, the gold is well worth the risk.
The Tears look beautiful in my collection. A thousand thanks once again.
Safe journey to you.
Please... give them to me! I must have them!
Be careful, that brute was absolutely huge!
Won't you help me... please?
Good riddance!
Tootle-loo! Ahaha!
It was a pleasure talking to you. No lie.
May your story end happily!
You're no fun. I bet you don't like dogs.
Keep an eye out for my things, won't you?
Never trust what anyone tells you.
Now go, before someone sees us.
Careful. Beasts all around. You might taste good to them, no?
Hahahaha! You're so funny My Lord! I mean, your presence is intoxicating!
Buh-bye! Nice talking with you, Lord. No need to come back any time soon.
Sheogorath is even more handsome in real life!
Who was that I was talking to? Not Sheogorath.
I'm off to find a dog.
It is good to see you, Lord.
M'aiq wishes you well.
Goodbye. And thank you.
Come back when you've learned something.
Believe me, it was no picnic. But thanks to our friend here, I now know we can close these hell-gates. We can defend Bruma!
Nothing really matters here anyway.
I keep hoping that I won't wake up the next time they kill me. But I always do. We will never escape this nightmare.
As you command, Countess.
I'll be waiting for teeth and horns.
Don't let the guards catch you.
You'll see. Things will change.
Sorry, just doing my job.
May you always wear soft silks.
You go get 'em! And whip their asses for Newheim!
Go, go! Socialize! Talk to those fine people, and then plunge your knife into their throats when they ain't lookin'! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I wish you luck. I fear you'll need it.
Pleasure and pain be with you.
May all your days be filled with enlightenment and mirth!
Pleasure and pain, my lady.
Pleasure and pain, my lord.
The Altar of Arden-Sul awaits.
Farewell! And tell your friends! The Inn of Ill Omen is open for business, as always!
Goodbye, my friend! And remember, you're always welcome here!
Go on now, get out of my inn! I don't need your kind hanging about!
Don't make me show you to the door.
Trust me when I say we'll give you a night to remember.
Be nice to have someone else to do the... uh... dirty work.
Can't wait to get my hands on you...
Hope to see you again soon.
Just look for me if you need anything else.
Back to work for poor old Orgnolf.
Didn't you have some things to give me?
Make sure you show that shovel to Thoronir. It is the final bit of proof we need to possibly clear his name.
I am still aghast. To think that someone would stoop so low...
Bring that book immediately to Thoronir.
Make sure you have proof before you accuse anyone of a terrible crime like grave robbing.
Thanks again for your help, we had no other place to turn.
Let's keep my problem with Audens just between you and I.
If you tell anyone I said anything bad about Audens, I'll deny it.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Safe journey, milord.
Safe journey, milady.
Just exit the city through the North Gate. It isn't far from there.
Come back when you have the real thing.
No proof, no money.
Finally, a chance for revenge.
If the guards don't like you, then I probably will! Hahaha.
Nice try.
Gawk at me will you...
Hmmm, wonder if it's too late to ask for less rat in tomorrow's dinner?
She was an evil, evil woman.
Maybe I'll never see the sun again, but neither will Arnora!
Farewell. May the roads carry you safely in your journeys.
No rest for the weary Orgnolf.
Thank you for saving my business, I won't forget it.
May the Goddess watch you.
Please bring back Rockshatter. It means a great deal to me.
Suit yourself.
Raelynn will finally get what's coming to her.
Oh, go on! Leave me then!
I'll talk to you some more yesterday.
Don't work too hard.
Work hard!
Back to work I go.
Let me know if you need something killed.
If you hear any bones talking, come get me right away!
Those bones want out.
Be well, milady.
Be well, milord.
Find comfort in your powerlessness.
I return to work, Lord. Farewell.
May the bones of your enemies be warm with blood, Lord.
My Lord rules strongly and without exhaustion.
It's been a pleasure Lord, now it's back to getting some rest and relaxation. All this talking has taken its toll on me.
May your blade always strike true!
Hmm? Oh, yeah... Bye...
Get back to work
Yeah. Nice going.
Show me something.
Stop wasting time. Get to Harlun's Watch. Now.
Go to, bold fighterperson.
Anon us most soon again, for sooth.
We are so very sooth.
Precedeth most urgentlike.
Let this be our little secret.
Please! Get on with it!
Go help Lord Rugdumph. And wipe that smile off your face!
Haul your carcass to that settlement, meat.
Not bad.
Show me to them.
Okay.
Move your ass, boot.
Find the fugitives. Make yourself useful.
Get to hunting, meat.
Out of my way!
A happy customer is a returning customer.
Remember, come to me for all your crafting needs.
You see, I am the Master Smith of New Sheoth, don't bother with that other smith in town.
Good fortune, Volendrung.
Later, then.
Happy hunting, my Brother!
Happy hunting, my Sister!
Damn the Tenets! I'll cleave you in two if you don't get out of my face!
Get some rest.
Be cautious... their leader sounds dangerous.
I await your return... if you return.
Good luck... you'll need it.
Take my advice. Stay away from the Watchmen.
I'm going to keep a low profile for a while.
Damn Watchman. I bet they're all crooked.
Yer next!
Lucky I'm not makin' ya swim.
Don't you have something to find?
No one tangles with Kurdan... remember that.
You're a pal.
You're a lying bastard. You killed Ra'vindra. And now I'm going to kill you.
Then to hell with you!
Thanks for the help. You're okay.
What are we waiting for?
Get a move on, will you?
People are just ignorant around here...
Everyone wants my weapons. But they're my weapons. Mine!
Fortune and fame, friend.
May riches fill your pockets, friend.
Just keep going. Nothing to eat here.
Run along and play!
Bye, dear.
Watch for them.
Watch your back.
May the Scalons tremble in your wake, My Lord.
Run along now, little one. Go and play with the other godlings.
Was that...? Nah, just my imagination.
Go in Madness.
I am your servant, Lord Sheogorath.
Stick close and let us do our job, and you'll be all right.
She's dead. I'm sorry, sire, but we have to keep moving.
I hope you learn something from Tar-Meena about that book. This might just be the break we need.
It sounds like those books may be an important lead. Get back to me as soon as you turn up anything new.
Follow me. I know how to get to the part of the sewers where we need to meet the Sponsor.
Make it quick. The longer we spend down here, the more chance we have of being discovered.
I'll see you back at Cloud Ruler Temple. Good luck.
I offer no excuses, sire. But my life is yours. No assassin will take you while I draw breath.
Get a move on.
Just keep walking.
Now get out of here.
Shadow hide you, Pickpocket.
Somehow I think we will meet again.
There are guards at the top of the stairs. Be as quiet as you can.
We appreciate it.
All we want is work to do.
Mind your own business.
Go protect Elante. She's doing important research.
Get moving. You need to get rid of those thieves.
Take care of Lelles. He needs the help.
Go take care of the rats. Then talk to me.
Take care of the rats.
Good going.
Where are they?
We're ready.
Bless you.
Find the Stone, please!
We need your help desperately!
Talk to Cirroc about that contract. Make me proud.
I knew this little party was too good to be true...
Don't get any ideas about wandering off alone. I'm keeping my eye on everyone, including you.
Be wary the shadows, friend.
Finally, no need to sleep with an eye open.
Go go! There's no time to waste!
Shhhh. The walls have ears!
Be wary the shadows.
May your path be free of danger.
You've taken up enough of my time.
Bye now, sweetie. I look forward to seeing you again.
Yeah, right. 'Til next time.
For everyone's sake, would you just leave? Now?
See you back in Anvil.
They met me at eleven as well. And believe me, I arrived right on time.
I'm merely a man. How could I resist? What a mess I've gotten myself into.
Talk to her, she seems to have all the answers.
Don't spend all the money from the reward in one place.
Gweden isn't far; they're taking quite a risk committing these crimes so close to Anvil.
They've never hurt anyone yet, but its never too late for them to start.
The Flowing Bowl attracts the worst Anvil has to offer. Always be on your guard.
I hope the reward will suit the risk. It's all I have.
Good-for-nothing louse of a husband. He's lucky I still love him.
Until our paths cross again, my friend.
I am undone.
Until your return.
Good luck. And don't underestimate the goblins. They're more dangerous than they look.
Idiot.
Do me a favor, don't say anything to the other guards that I fell for it, ok? Thanks.
Next time you want to "help out," just don't.
You're sharp for an adventurer. If you ever decide to retire, I'm sure the Anvil City Watch would love to have you.
Be cautious, my friend.
I love you, Zoe.
Yes, yes. Goodbye.
I amaze me.
Don't feel bad that you're not as gifted as me.
I hope I didn't use too many big words.
Farewell, My Lord.
I shall serve with honor, Lord.
Well, that was humbling.
Send Relmyna my love. That'll get her going.
Congratulations!
We will speak when your task is complete.
You can go now. Run along. Scoot!
You'll be back. They always come back.
Ta! Come visit again! Or I'll pluck out your eyes.
I expect results, Inquisitor, and I expect them soon.
Finish what you've started, friend. It'll do wonders for you.
Take your time, and hurry back. I might not be waiting for you when you return.
Farewell, child.
Watch your back, citizen.
You'll regret this.
I can't wait to be back in Skingrad, safe and sound.
Please, hurry! Get rid of those things!
You're wasting your time.
Whatever.
It's tavern time!
Payday! Let's roll!
The blade. It hungers for souls.
Umbra. It is everything.
Going so soon? Come back when your blades need sharpening.
Go. Sink your blade deep into the flesh of your enemies.
When your blade bites into your foe and he screams in pain, think of me.
I have much to do. This better be good.
May Arden-Sul enrich your mind and guide your heart.
Tread the humble path and find enlightenment.
I have failed you, Arden-Sul... I am sorry.
I wish something would happen already. There is so much else I could be doing.
May your arrows always strike true!
By Sithis, I hope you shoot your own eye out...
There are things to be done. So many things...
Oh, go away! Shoo! Shoo! A man's not even safe in his own home anymore!
Just... just leave me alone, all right? I don't want no trouble!
You've shown me mercy. I won't forget that. Thank you.
We need one more piece of evidence to make Agarmir's guilt complete.
I hope you can forgive me. I had no idea.
I will not accept your accusations without evidence.
Goodbye. Hope to see you again very soon.
Please, I'm very busy.
Goodbye. Please, come again.
Remember. Bernadette Peneles. 6 am. Don't let her see you watching!
Don't let Toutius Sextius catch you following him. He's much more dangerous than he looks!
Be careful. Davide Surilie is the ringleader. You must NOT let him catch you watching him!
Please, return soon. It's always a pleasure to see you.
0, 1, 0. I always aim for the heart. 1, 0, 1.
12, 3, 2, 2. It's hopeless. 15, 5, 3. The town is lost. 0, 0, 0.
Finally! My collection is complete!
Excuse me, I have important things to do.
Take care! Come back for a chat whenever you have the chance.
May you bleed well!
I'm watching you.
Goodbye. So long. See you soon. Or not. Whichever it might be.
Gal bursten it.
Fimmion gone. Bye bye. Go find pumpkin.
The young folk just don't appreciate a good stick anymore.
I'm leaving. I've got to find a way out of here.
I'd better get back to practicing.
Be careful around here.
I think... I'll just rest my eyes for a moment.
I'm so tired.
I hope I'm not dreaming.
Did that just happen?
My Lord has a real edge I'd like to cut myself on.
Please don't go! I have no one else to talk to.
My belly is rumbling, so I must leave. It has been an honor to talk to you, Lord Sheogorath.
I wish I had a stick like that.
Good to see you.
Hi.
Greetings.
Hello.
Ah yes, the Mythic Dawn scholar. What else can I help you with?
Brother, if I may have a word.
Sister, if I may have a word.
Excuse me, Brother. Can you spare a moment?
Excuse me, Sister. Can you spare a moment?
I've been meaning to speak with you.
I am at your service, Arch-Mage.
Greetings, Master-Wizard.

What is it, Associate?
Hello, Associate.
Well met, guildmate.
Your Grace.
Wait! I need to speak with you!
It is good to see you again.
Help!
You have kept your word. Now I will keep mine. What is it you wish to know?
Are we there yet?
You are a welcome sight!
Shouldn't you be feeding the prisoners, slop drudge?
I don't have time to help you now!
What do you want now?
This is a restricted area, I'm afraid. Guild mages only.
I am anxious to hear news of the book.
What news about Earana?
I have a job to do, and nothing will stand in my way!
Hmmm. Maybe he lives in the Elven Gardens district.
I see there are too many thieves in the city.
Ah, the Thieves Guild's new favorite.
Old friend!
Well met, old friend!
I hope you have some good news this time.
Ah! The triumphant Associate returns!
Oh, you're still alive! I was worried!
Can I help you, Associate?
Do something!
You must make them stop!
New blood. What is it?
Hmmm. Another comes to us. What is it?
You finish the clean-up, new blood. Look in the houses. Get moving, so we can go home.
We've got work to do.
I am at your mercy for now, scum.
Get away! You will die here!
It's been horrible. Horrible.
Peryite save us!
Where is our Lord?
Lord, where are you?
I am sorry, Lord.
Never again. Never again.
Order is restored.
Thank Peryite we've been saved!
What fools we are!
Good cheer and jubilant welcome, lady.
Good cheer and jubilant welcome, lord.
Hello again, my friend.
Greetings, friend.
Your return is most welcome, Your Grace.
Yes, Master. You need me?
Can I help you, sister?
Can I help you, brother?
Yes, ma'am? What can I do for you?
Yes, sir? What can I do for you?
What is it, boot?
Join the Guild, and fight for gold.
Looking for action? Think about the Fighters Guild.
Greetings, Goldbrand.
Greetings, Star-Bearer.
All honor to the Hide and the Wearer.
We greet you, Spellbreaker.
A merry dance for the Lord of Chance.
Speak.
Careful...
Well?
Okay...
The Flame of Agnon! Sheogorath's blessing upon you!
All hail the victor of Cylarne! All hail the Great Torch of Mania!
The Great Torch shines as a beacon of Mania!
Why? Why would you light the Great Torch for Dementia?
You have arrived at last!
I am honored by your presence. How can Ocheeva be of assistance?
You are finding your contracts agreeable, I hope?
I do not know what Lucien sees in you, but this Sanctuary is cursed by your presence.
I wish to welcome you to this Sanctuary, my newest Brother.
I wish to welcome you to this Sanctuary, my newest Sister.
It fills my heart with warmth to see you again, Brother.
It fills my heart with warmth to see you again, Sister.
Ah, greetings.
My scales grow cold whenever you approach.
Please, you must help me!
I think we should get out of here, quick!
Did you hear what happened to Ruslan and Luronk? One of the Watchmen fleeced them for all their coin!
Ruslan and Luronk are going around saying that some of the Imperial Watch are corrupt.
Audens Avidius escaped from prison!
The Imperial Watch is asking around for anyone that might have seen Audens Avidius. He's escaped from prison!
Yes, sister?
Yes, brother?
I'm pleased you've joined us.
I'm honored by your presence.
Welcome back to the true world.
There isn't any more to say. Please, lay down and sleep.
This is your last chance to get ready. Once you're asleep, there's no coming back until Henantier awakens.
We've arrived.
Be patient, all will be explained.
I hope you've prepared yourself. The journey you're to undertake could be dangerous.
Were you looking for me?
Excuse me, madam.
Excuse me, sir.
Hello to you.
You want to speak to me?
Such a pleasure to be in good company.
Important things to do... so many important things to do.
A vampire! Away, everyone! Run!
Vampire! Unclean beast! Die!
Die, unholy monster!
You should really get to a healer. You're looking rather pale.
Have you been well recently? Your skin looks a bit... off.
Are you not feeling well?
Is everything all right? You look a bit ill.
Do you have any shoes? No? Mirili offered me some shoes if I ran an errand for her research. I just ran instead. Say, do you have any shoes?
Can you spare some coins? I need a drink.
You're the Gray Fox! Please don't hurt me!
It's the Gray Fox! I can't believe it's really you!
You're the Gray Fox!
Greetings, friend!
Oh... hello.
Have you seen my sanity? It went by here just a moment ago.
Are you just going to stand there?
Buy us a drink!
I've got my eye on you.
Sing for Big Head.
Hi there, Sparkles.
Hey there, Chief.
How are you, pal?
What are you doing here?
The Gray Fox protects you.
Can ya spare a coin?
Have pity sir. I gots nothin' ta eat.
Have pity beautiful lady, I gots nothin' ta eat.
A coin for an old beggar?
Me children are starving. Please help.
Have pity on an old war veteran.
Spare a coin for the infirm?
I'm only asking for a single coin.
Who will help an old beggar?
Have mercy. Just one coin.
Yes. What is it?
My hatchlings for you, Lord.
My Lord! You are here!
Our Lord comes singing! Songs for Sheogorath!
You honor me with your presence, Lord Sheogorath.
Cheers to Sheogorath!
How could the Nine let this happen? Are they angry with us?
I've looked everywhere. Perhaps she's still in Kvatch, in a basement, hiding?
I'm just tired. I can't face it. I have to start over, from nothing.
Kvatch is finished. There's nothing left.
I'm just lucky to be alive.
I just can't sleep. I lie down and close my eyes, but I can't stop thinking about it.
It's the smell, really. Smoke and fire. And something worse. In the ruins.
Blessed we are.
Greetings, honored friend.
Yes, honored guest?
A visitor, yes?
Honored one.
Tidings.
Fresh game.
The prey approaches.
Questions?
This scent is foul.
Hiss!
Unwelcome it is.
A hated one.
That's a real shame.
Look at the muscles on you!
You're a sneaky looking sort.
You have the hands of a healer.
There's an air of Mysticism about you.
You have the eyes of a trained marksman.
You look like a bright one.
You have the hands of an illusionist.
Seems you've bloodied your knuckles a few times.
There's a charge in the air. Been casting some destruction spells?
You smell of death. Been conjuring up dead things?
You look like you've swung a mace or two in your time.
Looks like you're handy with a blade.
You're a fit one. Been running a lot?
You've got a real bounce to your step. I'll bet you're quite the acrobat.
How about mixing up some potions? You look like quite the alchemist.
You look skilled in Alteration. Maybe you can teach me something.
You've got the hands of a smith. Must have spent some time repairing your gear.
Your shield arm looks strong.
You look like someone who's comfortable in heavy armor.
I heard you know how to move in light armor.
You look like a shrewd businessman.
You've got some nimble fingers. What have you been getting into?
You've got quite the silver tongue.
Good morning.
Morning.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
Good evening.
Evening.
Hello!
Hi there!
Well met!
Good to see you!
Hi!
How are you?
You're making me nervous, sneaking around like that. Just make sure you keep your hands to yourself.
Greetings!
Greetings, Imperial.
Greetings, Khajiit.
Greetings, marsh-friend.
Greetings, Orc.
Greetings, Nord.
Greetings, Redguard.
Greetings, High Elf.
Greetings, Dunmer.
Greetings, Bosmer.
Greetings, Breton.
Well met.
Greetings to you.
Hi there.
Hail.
How do you do?
Hello there.
How goes it?
What is it?
Oh. Hello.
It's you. Hi.
Why do you bother me? Go away!
What do you want?
How are you today?
What do you want, Breton trash?
What do you want, ashborn?
Something on your mind, goldenrod?
Speak, Imperial dog.
Something on your mind, furlicker?
Speak, snowman, and stop wasting my time.
You have something to say, dungheap?
Come to bother me with a war story, Redguard?
What do you want, treehugger?
What is it now?
Oh, it's you.
Can I help you?
Leave me alone.
I don't have time for you.
You don't look well, my friend. You should seek a healer.
Have you been to a Healer recently? Because you don't look so good.
Whatever you've got, I don't want it. Head to the Church before you get me sick.
Get away from me. I don't want whatever you've got!
This is a stopgap hello because none of the other Hellos have blank LinkFrom lists. Mark will fix this soon, I bet.
Stay back, prisoner.
Don't get too close.
Do as you're told, and you'll be all right.
I've been looking for you. We have a situation in Bruma that I need you to deal with.
Have you helped Captain Burd and his men close the Oblivion Gate yet?
I'm surprised to see you here. Have you been to talk to Baurus in the Imperial City yet?
We will exact our revenge on the Mythic Dawn for the Emperor's murder. By the holy blood of Talos, Mankar Camoran will pay for his crimes!
It sounds like you and Baurus are making progress in your hunt for the Amulet of Kings. Good work.
Once you locate the Mythic Dawn's shrine to Mehrunes Dagon, we may have a chance to recover the Amulet!
Dawn is breaking.
Greet the new day, brother.
Greet the new day, sister.
What news from Tamriel?
If I could kill myself, I would.
Mankar Camoran has a lot to answer for. No wonder he never comes down to the Eternal Garden.
Do you think we're safe for a few minutes?
I don't see any of them around right now.
I don't feel like talking right now.
You arrived just in time.
I fear the enemy came here for the Amulet of Kings.
We should get Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple immediately.
Is something wrong? Why are we stopping?
There is nothing more important now than locating Martin and bringing him safely back here.
Please, don't let Anaxes loose! He torments us night and day!
You're not one of us, are you? Are you here to destroy Gaiar Alata and end our nightmare?
You're new to Gaiar Alata, aren't you?
Please, end this nightmare if you can.
Good work tracking down the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine. We finally took the fight to the enemy.
I'll feel better when you've eliminated those spies. There's no telling what they may be planning.
Have you spoken to Martin yet? The plans you found make it clear that time is short.
I need a moment of your time. It's urgent.
Ah, there you are. We need to talk.
Do you have a moment? There's something we need to discuss.
I need to talk to you, soldier to soldier.
Something's come up. It can't wait.
My lord... I would speak with you.
My lord, I was wondering if I could speak with you. I understand that you have many more pressing concerns...
My lord, please excuse my presumption, but I would speak with you.
Good day to you, my lord.
I can't believe it's over... that giant demon... the Dragon... what happened? Have we won?
Did you see it? The avatar of Akatosh himself? There it is! The monument to our deliverance!
We're alive! You did it! You beat that monster! We won!
Congratulations on your victory, sir.
Congratulations on your victory, ma'am.
Welcome aboard, sir. It will be an honor to serve with you.
Welcome aboard, ma'am. It will be an honor to serve with you.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Good evening, ma'am.
Good morning, sir.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Sir.
Ma'am.
Pardon me, noble Scholar, but... Could I speak with you a minute?
Apprentice! Wait right there. We need to talk.
Fellow magister, may I speak with you?
I know you're busy, but I need a moment of your time.
Magister! We must talk! Please... It's rather urgent.
Excuse me, fellow magister. Is now a good time to talk?
Ahh, magister. I just remembered, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.
How may I assist you?
What can I do for you, Arch-Mage?
Hello, Master-Wizard.
Hello, Journeyman.
Greetings, Apprentice.
Greetings, guildmate.
Another mortal. Quaint.
Yes? What is it you want?
Yes, Your Grace?
The guild needs you more than ever.
Have you heard? Someone's been murdered! One of us!
What kind of party is this? Someone has been murdered!
Is that why someone invited us here? To kill us? This is horrible!
Are you all right? This murder has us all on edge, I know.
So, here we all are. It certainly is a nice house.
I can't quite decide where I should look. I don't want to break anything but the chest of gold could be hidden anywhere.
Two of us have been murdered! One of us is a killer! But who?
It's not safe to be alone. I certainly don't want to be the third victim.
This house is a deathtrap! We're being killed off, one by one!
So many people dead. I just don't know who to trust anymore.
It's... it's you... you're the only one left. You did it! You killed them all!
So that's it. It's down to you and me. I know I'm no killer, so that means...
You and I are the only ones left, but we're not alone in this house. That killer is in here with us, hiding. But where?
You and I are the only ones left. But we did it. We survived. We... we won!
*Gasp!*
Hides-His-Heart will be here any moment!
Oh! Oh look! My goodness... Two people here to confront me! Whatever shall I do?
Ooohhh...
Oh, my head...
I... I must get to the Grey Mare. Must get away from here...
Ah, the Gray Mare! Chorrol's finest repository of wine, women and song!
Oooohhh...
There is still a chance to strike back at the Necromancers.
Please don't hurt me!
Keep your distance, Associate.
Quickly, we must speak.
I hope you've found Erthor.
I hope this is important, Associate.
Is it safe now?
Welcome!
This can't be happening. This is horrible.
Did you find them?
Can you help me?
Welcome to Water's Edge!
Welcome to our humble village.
I can hardly believe you're standing here in front of me! The Listener himself! This is such an honor!
I can hardly believe you're standing here in front of me! The Listener herself! This is such an honor!
*Gasp!* Listener! How may I serve you?
I am yours to command, oh great Listener!
Blessings of the Lady upon you.
Dark days, my lady.
Dark days, my lord.
Do my eyes decieve me? You live?
Fool! Did you wish to have us both put to death?
I bid you welcome.
Good day, Your Grace.
We bow before the Ring.
We kiss the Ring.
The Key opens all doors.
The Great Torch spreads the light of Dementia across the land!
Shame on you for polluting Crucible with the glaring light of Mania.
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Ah, here you are. So good to finally meet you.
You are like a dark gift from the Night Mother herself. Please, tell me how I can help.
Hello, my Brother.
Hello, my Sister.
Were I not ordered to assist you I would forgo the Tenets and feast on your blood!
I've heard so much about you. Welcome to our family!
So good to see you! Is there anything you need?
Hello again.
Seeing you in this Sanctuary makes me wish I were back on the streets.
You are like an unholy vision. So beautiful.
Agh! Go away! Go away!
You ain't one of me crew. What business ye be havin' here, mate?
Ho hey, sweet lady of Wayrest! Ho hey, sweet lady of mine! Oh I'll see you again,  yes I'll see you again, sweet lady of Wayrest so fine!
[Snort!]
Psst! Hey you! Yeah, you! Come here! I got what you need...
I was praying for your swift return.
Perhaps you can help me.
Please leave me be...
Hello, father.
How are you doing, dear?
Is that a bit of frostbite I see? Hehehe.
Welcome back to the University. It's good to see you again.
How nice to see you again.
Welcome to the Alchemy Headquarters.
What can I do for you this fine day?
Do you return triumphant?
Have you discovered the truth?
Thank you for sparing me.
Please, hear me out.
If it wasn't for you, I never would have found Reynald. Thank you.
I can't believe I've been reunited with my brother!
How can I help you today, friend?
Hail!
Hmmm... you look familiar. If only I could remember.
Unless there's a drink in this for me, you might as well stop talking.
I fear grave tidings.
Any word of Aleron?
I really need your help.
Excuse me, my lord.
Excuse me, my lady.
How did you fare?
You must get us out of here.
Oh no...
Thank you...
Please...
You must have a deathwish.
What now?
Can't you see that I'm busy?
I don't know you, and I don't care to know you.
Welcome back.
Barkeep! A drink for my friend!
What can I do for you now, my friend?
Hey there.
If only we had our home back...
Ahhh. So good to be back home.
You have but to lead us to Weatherleah.
Is your weapon stained with the foul blood of the ogres?
Do I sense good news?
Nothing is as important as a man's home. We must have ours back.
Perchance, dare I ask another favor?
I've heard what you've done.
Again we meet.
Aleron... my sweet husband...
Oh my poor Aleron...
Stand aside!
Come to gloat, eh? Well, you'll get no apologies from me.
Bradon... I'll miss you...
You grace my presence once again.
Bastard.
I'm pleased to see you again.
Uh huh?
You are always welcome at Harm's Folly.
Well met. I trust no great harm has befallen you.
If you're here to rob me, I'm afraid I have nothing left.
How's the fishing trip going?
The fishing is best when it's raining like this. The fish all come right to the top. It's like they're waiting to be caught.
Finally, I'll be able to retire.
Still staying away from my fishing spots? I may be retired but they're still mine, you understand?
I feel much better now that you're here.
Welcome to Shardrock.
Ah, we meet again. No hard feelings, I hope!
Don't worry, I hold no grudges. You bested me! I am man enough to admit it!
And here you are again, my friend!
Umbacano nearly did us in this time, and no mistake.
Please, tell me you have my remedy... I can't hold out much longer!
Can't sleep... the walls, they'd fall on me. Can't have that.
I must be ready to run out at a moment's notice. Can't sleep.
Can't sleep.
Can't sleep at home so I just walk around. Can't sleep.
I wish I could find a spot to sleep where the walls won't collapse on me. Can't have that.
Can't sleep at home. Can't sleep. The walls aren't safe.
Our love has made me the happiest woman in the Isles.
Do you miss your home, love?
Hello there. You'd look great in my newest work.
Careful! Don't want to get squashed.
Always a pleasure.
Speak, while I can still hear you.
Did you hear that?
It's so hard to concentrate with all that noise!
Whoa. What was that?
Here is your horse.
My Lord Sheogorath!
My Lord!
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Should you need something, I will be happy to oblige.
How fair thee, friend?
Welcome. Please, don't be shy. I'm listening.
How does the day greet you, friend?
May I help you?
I'm listening, please, go ahead.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
I suppose I have a moment. What is it?
Do you need something?
I am busy, so, if you will excuse me.
I hope this won't take long.
Is it necessary that you speak with me?
Be quick about this or find someone else to talk to.
You hardly seem worth talking to.
Greetings, Argonian.
Greetings, fellow Breton.
What is it, pondscum?
You dare disturb me in my sanctum?!?
Didn't I give you something to do?
Back so soon? And here I was hoping you'd manage to get killed.
Choices, choices. That took you long enough.
Soon we will birth a new Gatekeeper!
Our child stands guard once again.
The Gray Fox is waiting inside.
I can't believe they're here!
I hope you're pleased with your earnings.
I have some things for you.
Ah, the ghost effect; an excellent demonstration of Xedilian's true power.
Nothing warms the heart like the sound of rending flesh. Great choice!
Last chamber... this should be entertaining.
Too bad none of those keys fit the lock... hahahaha!
Ah! The classic fire trap. Always a favorite, especially in the colder months.
Another chamber, another victim to eliminate. Hurry, the anticipation is overwhelming!
Hehe. Watching them run from the Giant Gnarl gets me every time.
Unleashed the swarm did we? Nothing like a little bloodlust to start the encounter off right.
Time to choose! Oh, how I missed these moments... so exhilarating!
Allow me to be your guide.
My goodness!
The Gates! The Gates! And...him!
You will be sweet, bloody nectar for the lady.
You've got to get me out of here! Come on, open the door!
A curse on that Hieronymus Lex!
Changed your mind, have you? The offer's still good.
What's the story on Maglir and his contract?
About time.
Ready for duty?
Go ahead, boot.
Report, soldier.
What did you do to my little rats?
Oh, you're such a sweetie!
Why aren't you finding Pinarus?
Oh, my poor little rats!
At your service, Master.
So? What happened?
One last time.
You've done well.
How'd it go?
Don't talk to me.
Go on.
You can do this.
We're making progress.
You got him?
Can't quit now.
Let me handle this.
What do you have?
Get moving.
More trouble.
We need to talk.
Let's talk.
You ready?
We've been had.
It's a great loss.
I fear the worst.
We need your help.
You seek the way?
Don't let the ogres get me!
The poor man's terrified.
All hail the Corrupter of Souls.
The light shines within us.
May you never darken.
The flesh is weak. The light is all.
Good to see you again!
There isn't time for idle chatter.
You again? Really?
You better have a very good reason to interrupt me!
You try my patience. Out with it!
Why are you bothering me with that wagging tongue? Do you know how long it would waggle after I rip it from your mouth? I do. Don't tempt me.
It's been too long. Come here and hurt me a little.
You set my blood on fire. Come closer and burn me.
You wound me, and my heart bleeds with pleasure.
Master... I'll never get used to saying that. What can I do for you?
What do you need... Master?
He sees all, knows all.
All honor to the Ebony Blade.
We honor you, Mace-Bearer.
The Skull sees.
Aren't you an ugly one.
I've been looking for you.
May we forever serve the Night Mother.
There once was hardy young lad of the sea... A Redguard of courage and honor was he... Sail on, my Cyrus, sail on...
You get any closer and I'll turn your bones to ash. Back off.
Can't... Can't move... Body frozen... Must have been... the damn... Mead...
The staff and the scamps are gone! You must have made it to Darkfathom Cave.
You've returned. And with the little ones in tow. Lovely.
Are you here to help Rosentia?
Salutations.
Hello again, sister.
Hello again, brother.
Hello again, fellow vampire hunter.
Nice to meet you.
Good. You're back.
Please, I must speak.
On through you go.
Let me go paint us a way out of here.
I must have that Brush.
Any luck?
We must get out of this place.
Oh! You startled me!
Oh, thank you!
You've returned! But where is Rythe?
Please hurry, I fear Rythe is in danger.
Please, I don't know where to turn.
Can you help me, please?
Hey...
The Knights of the Thorn triumph once again!
I long to spill more foul daedra blood this day... for Cheydinhal!
This place is cursed... we must not let its spoiled ichor spill into our fair lands.
Hmph...
I suppose you'll do...
Stop gettin' in my way!
Wha'? You say somethin'?
Flyyyin'... flyyin' in the skyyyy.... cliff racer flys so high.... flyinnn'...
I'm very disappointed at the decision you've made.
I did what needed to be done.
That's all I'll be needing you for. Stay and watch, but don't interfere.
Please, go get Ulrich and convince him to follow you here. I'll do the rest.
Is something amiss? You have an ashen look on your face that tells me so.
I'm glad to see you've returned.
There's nothing else to say.
You're back. I trust everything went as planned?
Why are you still here?
Excuse me, may I have a moment of your time?
(Hic) Eh?
So much to do.
Thank you for visiting me.
What's done is done.
Fellow Knight! I bid you welcome.
It's good to see you, serjo.
Please leave me alone. I have important things to do.
Hello again, muthsera.
I've more important things to do than chat with you right now.
Sorry, I'm too busy to speak to you now.
Rosentia sent word ahead that she has you to thank for freeing her of those accursed little beasts.
It's good to see you again.
Well? Do you want your pay or not?
I need help collecting Swamp Tentacles. I'll even pay you.
Would you be willing to collect some Flame Stalk for me?
You're the Gray Fox! Thank you for everything you've done to help us here in the waterfront.
Mmmmm. Is that fresh bread I smell?
No, no, don't come any closer. I have to finish my morning survey of the dewfall at four precise locations.
I don't have time to talk. I'm in the middle of some very sensitive measurements.
Hold perfectly still! You're about to step on...
Not now. I need to concentrate. Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?
I don't have time to talk. My work cannot wait.
The flame stalks are particularly bright this year.
Everything's so dirty!
Do you really need to get so close?
Yuck.
You better have a good reason for disturbing me.
What is it? You try my patience!
This better be good, or you'll regret it.
You'r horse has been saddled.
Are you ready to ride?
I see you're a follower of the Gray Fox, too.
My Lord! I've been waiting so long for you to return!
I hardly need to tell you how important my work is, Lord Sheogorath.
The Madgod graces us!
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
I am never too busy for good talk.
Please, join me.
It's so good to meet you.
Walk with virtue, friend.
I'm listening. Go ahead.
You may speak.
What is it, sera?
What is it, muthsera?
Spit it out or hit the road.
Whatever you're looking for, I'm sure I don't know how to find it.
If you'll excuse me, I don't have time for you right now. Or ever.
What hole did you crawl out of?
You remind me of my homeland. During the Blight.
Greetings, my Dunmer brother.
Greetings, my Dunmer sister.
Lead on, Your Grace.
I am yours to command, Your Grace.
You... Your Grace. We did not expect you here.
Have you brought reinforcements?
Your Grace...
We will hold the line.
We will not fail you, Your Grace.
May the Madgod watch over you.
How did you survive the collapse?
Your Grace! You're alive!
The Altar of Rapture will be ours.
The Aureals will soon pay for their arrogance.
Victory is sweet!
The Mazken do not forget their friends.
How may I serve?
Sheogorath's blessings upon you.
No sign of trouble, Your Grace.
Xeddefen has been silent, Your Grace.
Your humble servant, My Lord.
You honor me, Lord.
You honor me, Your Grace.
Your Seducers are at the ready, Your Grace.
Madgod's blessings, Duke of Mania.
Madgod's blessings, Duchess of Mania.
Blessings, dark sister.
Blessings, citizen.
Quickly, worm.
Blessings, brother.
All glory, mistress.
You helped us at Cylarne. The Mazken do not forget their friends.
The Aureals no longer defile holy Cylarne, thanks to you.
What's going on here? Who's this?
Begone, mortal.
Cylarne shall be ours.
The Mazken are unworthy to guard the Altar of Despair.
The Aureals do not forget their friends.
Welcome to the Halcyon Conservatory.
Welcome to the House of Mania.
At your command, Lord Sheogorath.
I stand ready, Lord.
The Saints stand strong, Your Grace.
Madgod's blessings, Your Grace.
Hail, Duke of Dementia.
Hail, Duchess of Dementia.
Speak, citizen.
Speak quickly, mortal.
Speak, sister.
Speak, dog.
Speak, brother.
I am honored, mistress.
Cylarne is ours at last, thanks to you.
The Mazken no longer defile holy Cylarne, thanks to you.
Martin Septim, on behalf of the Elder Council, I accept your claim to the Imperial Throne. We should arrange the coronation ceremony as soon as ...
Your Highness, what are your orders? Shall the Guard fall back to the Palace?
Everything is ready for Martin's arrival, don't worry.
Bah. Get out of my sight.
I'm waiting for that book.
You are in good spirits today, milady
Oh my! Are you an adventurer?
How are we supposed to live under this curfew?
I see you've returned safely, Associate.
Have you completed your task?
Don't you have somewhere else to be?
Good enough.
No more delays, please.
Quite satisfactory.
Shall we go?
Oh. Yes. How do you do?
Good enough!
Let's take them!
All right!
Hey! Whoa! You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!
Oh, Faelian, dear Faelian... why must you ruin both our lives?
So, have you managed to persuade Herminia Cinna to part with the Ayleid Crown?
Even in its ruined state, it is magnificent, isn't it? In the days of its power, Nenalata must have been glorious indeed.
The Black Hand welcomes you!
You honor us with your presence.
So wonderful to see you again. I don't know what I would have done without your help.
Oh, I'll never get that crystal ball back. Not with those frightful spirits floating around...
Oh! You've returned! I do hope you have good news.
Whew. I've never worked so hard on a formula in my life, but I got your Grand Elixir of Exploration done.
Shhhhhh!
Researching the Elixir has been exhausting, but well worth the time.
Your Strong Elixir is complete. I think you'll be pleased with the results.
The process of alchemy is much easier when the alchemist isn't being bothered.
Please tell me you have more Nirnroot for me.
One Moderate Elixir of Exploration, coming right up!
Need I remind you once more?
Come across any more Nirnroot?
Your Elixir is ready!
Don't leave before you hear what I have to tell you. You'll regret it.
What brings you to my little home underground?
Welcome to my home underground. Hehe.
Land ho!
What a fool I was.
I abhor killing, but you did the right thing.
Selene'll get what's coming to her when we arrive home.
Remove the prisoner.
I'm in your debt.
Please help me.
What can I do for you?
I hope you've returned victorious.
You fool!
You look uneasy. I hope things are going well.
Anything you require, you're welcome to it.
You're welcome here.
At last we meet in the flesh.
Please... help me, I can't remember anything.
We must get out of this place!
My word! You startled me! Are you real?
How did I get here? Do you know the way out?
My friend!
Good evening, sister.
Good evening, brother.
Please, return anytime friend.
So good of you to drop by again.
Now that I have my notes back, my research continues.
Back again I see!
Waiting's been difficult, I hope your journey was successful.
Ten years of research down the drain...
Welcome back, traveler.
So, what brings you here today?
My people long to be laid to rest. Please help them.
Welcome to Earil's Mysteries. As you probably guessed, I'm Earil.
Well, hello stranger.
I just thought you'd like to know, I'm overjoyed to bid you hello.
What's the latest news?
What is the meaning of this interruption?
Do you have the time?
I have your horse right here.
Oh-ho!
Keep this fair!
Welcome! If you wish to talk, it is really no trouble at all.
How delightful! Welcome.
An honor to be sure.
You're in good company, friend. Welcome.
You seem quite intriguing. Please, share your thoughts.
Greetings. What exactly do you require of me?
I see you. Hello.
All right then, I'm listening.
Any time now.
Ah, how quaint. How do you do?
Identify yourself.
Ask a commoner.
You creatures are all the same.
This is an unwelcome surprise.
Greetings, fellow Altmer.
You handled yourself pretty well back there. Just keep out of our way, got it?
If you want to help, prisoner, keep alert and let us do our job.
Don't get in our way.
I've still got my eye on you, prisoner.
I follow the Emperor's orders, but that doesn't mean I trust you.
This doesn't concern you, prisoner.
Don't try anything. I'm watching you.
Protect yourself...
There's trouble ahead.
Be careful...
I believe you and I were fated to meet today.
Don't make them wait.
Don't provoke them. They don't trust you.
I don't know where they're going.
I'm following them.
They're just doing their duty.
Be patient.
Not much farther.
The end is in sight.
I'm ready.
I sure don't like the looks of that Gate.
Do you really think we can close that thing?
We've got to get out of here!
I sure hope you know what you're doing.
So far, so good.
I don't like the looks of this.
Chancellor Ocato! The city is under attack! Oblivion Gates have opened, and daedra are inside the walls! The guard is overwhelmed!
Sire, Chancellor Ocato is expecting you. He had word of your arrival in the capital.
You made it! Not that I was worried about you.
Welcome to the Imperial Palace.
Do you think we have a chance, sir?
Do you think we have a chance, ma'am?
The daedra seemed to come out of nowhere!
I heard that Oblivion Gates are opening all over the city!
We just made it through to the Palace. The Market District was swarming with daedra.
My head is still spinning from everything that has happened. I'll need some time to adjust.
Your Highness? I am Narina Carvain, Countess of Bruma, at your service.
The Palace is cut off, sire. We were the last to make it through from the Legion Compound.
You did it, Captain! You closed the Oblivion Gate! We didn't think we'd ever see you alive again!
The Master will call us back to Tamriel soon. I'm sure of it.
I never tire of the beauty of Gaiar Alata.
I feel sure the Master will recognize my efforts and summon me to the Forbidden Grotto soon.
Out of the frying pan into the fire, eh?
This wasn't part of the plan, was it?
You're back. Did you bring help?
I will soon earn the Master's favor and be granted entry into the Forbidden Grotto.
What news from Tamriel? Is Lord Dagon's victory almost complete?
How can you be here? The Master said you were dead!
They say there's a gate opened outside the city! Let's go!
I'm close to understanding the complete gate-opening ritual. The final section is almost within my grasp.
I've made some progress with the Mysterium Xarxes, finally!
The Mysterium Xarxes is the most dangerous daedric sorcery I've ever encountered.
I can't escape the Xarxes, even in my dreams. I wonder if my warding spells will be enough.
I'll have to proceed cautiously with the Mysterium Xarxes. It is exceedingly dangerous.
Baurus. I want you to know... I don't blame you for what happened. You did everything you could. I'm glad to have you here by my side.
Bladesman, I was wondering if I might have a word?
Excuse me. If you have a moment, I would speak with you.
Hail Blade. Do you have a moment to talk?
Baurus. Good to see you.
Caroline. Don't let me keep you.
Belisarius, how are you?
Hail, Cyrus.
Jena, good day to you.
Roliand, all's well, I trust.
Captain. Carry on.
Good day, Jauffre.
Hail, Blade. What news?
I've put myself in your hands.
I have good news! I've made some progress on deciphering the gate-opening ritual.
I'm glad to see you. I'm finally starting to unlock the secrets of the second half of the gate-opening ritual.
Hello, my friend.
Good to see you, sir. We won't forget how you helped Anvil.
Good to see you, ma'am. We won't forget how you helped Anvil.
You're the one that saved Cheydinhal from that Oblivion Gate, aren't you?
You don't need to worry about the daedra taking Bruma. You've got the best soldiers in Cyrodiil here now.
I'm looking forward to some payback for what those bastards did to Kvatch.
How long will Bruma need our help? Count Caro's orders were to return to Leyawiin as soon as Bruma was secure.
I can't wait to get back to Skingrad. I ain't cut out for this damned weather.
Do you think the attack will come soon, ma'am?
Do you think the attack will come soon, sir?
Do you think we stand a chance?
Let's teach those bastards a lesson!
There's no way I'm going in there!
Start talkin' already!
I've been waiting for you. Have a seat.
You're back! Have a seat and tell me everything.
Thank you for convincing her to meet with me.
Are you still here?
We should be on our way.
Welcome to this holy library, Lady Camoran
The prophecies are vague on this point. Cross check it.
Transfer that scroll to the archives.
Remember to keep the blindfold on. Your eyes must only be used to read the scrolls.
Step forward, herald of madness. Speak with me if you would.
Another loony from that door!
Voices from nowhere. I don't get paid enough.
Stay back. Isn't safe here.
Out of the way slop drudge.
Is there any news?
Be careful in here.
Any progress to report?
I hope the work at Vahtacen goes well.
There's more work to be done.
I expected you back sooner.
Have you been to Wellspring Grove?
I've been waiting for you, Associate.
This citizen is accusing you of stealing the bust of Llathasa from Cheydinhal. I even found the bust in your cabinet. What do you have to say?
No sign of Armand Christophe, Sir.
Any sign of Armand Christophe?
Can you tell me where Armand Christophe is hiding?
Have you seen Armand Christophe?
Silencer! You have returned! What news of the traitor?
You look lost.
Greetings, mage.
Hmm. You don't look like a vampire...
Carry on, soldier.
I'm rather busy.
The plan should work, with the Shadow's blessing.
We need more pressure on Lex. He's a stubborn fetcher.
I have word that two of the jobs were successful.
No sign of the Gray Fox, sir.
I'm looking for the Gray Fox. What can you tell me?
I have an arrest warrant for the Gray Fox. Do you know where he is?
The Gray Fox is hiding nearby. What do you know about him?
We have to stay in our homes while the Watch searches for the Gray Fox.
You have returned!
Don't interrupt me.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
State your business.
Come. We must talk.
The Gray Fox is waiting for you.
Moth's blessing upon you.
Welcome. Let's talk.
Don't keep the Gray Fox waiting.
Have a seat. Please.
You have work to do. Go on. Get out of here.
You don't belong here.
Stay back! We mustn't be seen!
Time for you to cash in on my success.
No time to talk. I've got a job to do.
Need a hand, Associate?
That wasn't so bad.
Ready?
Glad to meet you.
We're in your debt.
Do I want to hear this?
You're being rude.
Shouldn't have any more problems with those cats.
Let's kill us some big cats.
La la la, la la la la...
Oh dear, whatever could you want?
Please, leave me in peace.
Honor the guild, friend.
I speak for the Night Mother.
Greetings, fellow Speaker.
Betrayer! I have found you at last! Your reckoning is at hand!
Silencer! What news do you bring?
Ah, you have arrived. Come now, we must speak. The Black Hand has need of your... talents.
Yes, my child?
What is it, Silencer?
Hey there, pal! Need a room?
Oh, by the Nine Divines, why do I get all the riff-raff?
Right, what can I do for you, citizen.
You've done it!
I see you haven't yet been able to drop the staff in Darkfathom Cave.
Darkfathom Cave awaits you.
I hope you've made the necessary preparations.
These scamps are making my home smell like a barn.
Damn it, now they're into my pantry!
Whatever you do... don't leave me alone with these things!
Please! Help me!
Get away from me!
I knew you'd show up.
Wasn't I clear?
Don't keep us waiting. I hate to wait.
Hmmm. You may be just what we've been looking for.
Yes, you'll do just fine. Signy will tell you all the details.
You're back. What news do you bring me?
I've much to tell you.
I can't speak to you right now.
Oh, you're back.
I don't know what else to tell you.
Halt!
What is it, Barthel?
Oh. It's you.
Greetings, investigator.
Hello. Welcome to Castle Chorrol.
Welcome to the Great Hall of Castle Chorrol, milord.
Welcome to the Great Hall of Castle Chorrol, milady.
Hello milord.
Hello milady.
Get to the Sigil Keep!
Get the key!
Time is wasting. We must move swiftly!
The time is almost here.
The Brethren are restless.
Please, leave me be.
I'm your prisoner.
What the... ?
Audens Avidius, you are under arrest for extortion and petty theft. Surrender peacefully and keep what little dignity you have left.
That's the last of them!
Stand your ground!
Please, do what you can to protect Antus. He's just a kid.
What can I do for you, stranger?
Victory!
Don't falter! We have them! We have them!
You can do it, Antus. You can do it... just follow big brother's lead...
You again. Are you ready yet?
Who are you?
You're back! You must tell me everything!
Please, don't waste time speaking to an old man. Go and help my sons.
Hello. You haven't seen my sons, have you? They went off into the forest to fight those monsters, and I'm worried about them.
Thanks to you, Cheydinhal is safe.
It's good to set my foot upon the soil of my home.
What a horrible turn of events.
Strange... with all the lava, you'd think I'd be warm, but all I feel is a bone-chilling cold. Perhaps it's fear...
I fear we're in over our heads.
Ahh... help at last.
I'm honored by your presence, friend.
Whatever comes out of that portal... Cheydinhal is ready.
Hail! This area is extremely dangerous. I'd recommend leaving quickly.
Well met, adventurer.
I hope you bring good news.
I knew I could count on you.
Reconsider?
It's a pleasure to see you.
We have awaited your arrival, messenger.
The lifter of curses returns!
Meet you at The Count's Arms. Good luck.
Whew. That was scary.
Just hold the ghosts off while I figure out how to open this damn door.
What was that?
This isn't my idea of a good time.
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
Oh! Errr... Hello.
You traveled a great distance to find me.
Ah... you've returned.
Hello, good sir.
Hello, good lady.
Stand clear!
I've come from speaking with Count Indarys, and I've news for you.
I must speak to the Count.
I trust there were no run-ins with the guards in the barracks.
I feel Ulrich's eyes upon me as we speak, so be brief.
He told you where it is?
Stick with the plan, and everything should go smoothly.
Welcome back to the world, convict! Hahaha.
Did that fetcher give you any information?
I don't know what else to say.
Change your mind?
You have no rights here, convict.
I've been waiting for you.
Have you found Black Brugo?
Have you anything new to report?
How goes the battle?
The manor is finally cleansed.
Stupid... just plain stupid.
You'll have to excuse me.
It's wonderful to see you again.
A hearty hello to you. So good to see you again!
I'm feeling much better now that the house is free of those ugly creatures.
It's nice to see you again.
Welcome back, my friend.
Sorry, I have little time to speak.
So, what's the news from Greyland?
Well met, adventurer. A moment of your time if you please.
The Moth Priests seem agitated today.
I pulled duty outside the Imperial Libray tonight. Curse my luck. Being that close to the Elder Scrolls gives me the creeps.
I don't see how the Empire can survive without an emperor.
I'm here to relieve you.
I'm your relief.
You're off duty now.
Go take your break.
All citizens are welcome in the Imperial Palace, at least on the first two floors.
Remember, trespassing in the Imperial Palace is a serious crime. Do not venture beyond the first and second floors.
Please show your respect for the Imperial Palace by keeping your voice down.
All visitors to the Imperial Palace are asked to keep their voices down, especially if the Council is in session.
Step back, plague bearer.
Take your flies and your sores over there.
Get a cure! And keep your distance.
Gods! Pox and rot! Get away from me!
Shoo! Flies, lice and disease? No, thank you.
All's quiet, eh? Times like this I think the thieves are all away on holiday.
Hail, fellow horseman! All's quiet in your stretch of the wild, I hope.
So? What do you have to report?
You look tired, my friend. I hope you're holding up all right.
What do you say, pal? Seen any action?
How goes it, friend? Keeping the killers and cutpurses at bay?
Those Fanatics are so tiresome. Do they have to interrupt our feast?
Could someone muffle the door? The sounds of combat are disturbing me.
Why should I help defend Vitharn? Isn't that was the soldiers are paid to do?
Let the soldiers fight the Fanatics. I have better things to do.
I'm not some commoner to take up a sword. Let the rabble risk their lives, not me.
It is the role of lesser men to fight for those of noble blood.
I'm praying for the gods to protect me from the Fanatics.
You're not looking yourself lately.
Ah! You must be the Arcane University's newest addition! This humble Battlemage bids you welcome!
All hail the Champion of Cyrodiil!
How can I assist you, Champion?
What do you need, Champion?
This had better be good...
It's... It's you! The Hero of Kvatch! This is truly an honor!
Hail, good citizen! How can I be of service?
What is it, citizen?
Mind telling me why you're sneakin' about? I don't think I have to tell you what the Legion thinks of thieves, now do I?
Whoa, girl! Whoa! Easy now... It's all right. Sorry, civilian. My steed gets spooked a bit easily. It's all those damn goblins and trolls, you see.
Shhh! You'll spook the deer!
You have my ear, citizen.
I tried to tidy up for Mirili, but she just shooed me away. Then she had the nerve to ask for my help fetching things for her research.
Can I tidy up for you? Your house is always such a mess.
Ah, my favorite patron! Anything Odd to show me? Ha ha ha.
Have you found any new Oddities?
If only I could end it all... it's so simple. No. I mustn't do it myself. Maybe someone will accidentally knock me off the edge. That'd be wonderful!
You must be the Gray Fox. Your reputation precedes you, as I'm sure you know.
Things are always such a mess around here!
Excuse me. I need to sweep right where you're standing.
Seen any dead things laying around?
1, 2, 3, 4....
Won't someone end me? Take my life, please!
Psst! You got any Skooma?
Would you mind stepping to the side so I can sweep there?
He's been fed and well rested for you.
Yeah?
Should we do anything about...?
Know anything about the stranger?
You're not welcome here, stranger.
Better be moving along, outsider.
We don't like strangers meddling in our affairs.
Get yer Black Horse Courier here!
Everybody needs a copy of the Black Horse Courier!
Don't be the last to read today's Black Horse Courier!
What can I do to you?
I hope you're enjoying the museum!
1,2... It's the Madgod! Wow. Wow. 4, 12, 36....
I bet Sheogorath has killed millions of things!
Sheogorath must have Skooma!
Perhaps my Lord could help me die?
Excuse me, my lord. I need to clean right where you're standing.
My Lord! What brings you to my humble museum?
May I have a snippet of your hair for my museum?
Welcome.
My pleasure, really.
Please, go ahead.
Please, by all means.
It is a privilege.
Good tidings, citizen.
Fine greetings to you.
A pleasure to see you.
Tidings, citizen.
What's this about?
Let's hear it.
Anytime now.
How can I help you?
Say it.
So tiresome.
Come on.
Go away.
Hurry up.
Greetings, Imperial brother.
Greetings, Imperial sister.
By the Nine Divines, you're the Grand Champion of the Arena! This is such an honor!
Hello, Warlock.
Hello, Apprentice.
I don't belong. Not my place. Shouldn't have gone.
Very bad. I've been bad. I thought I was good, but I was bad. I've been punished. They'll all be punished.
I can't believe I'm alive!
Are they gone?
We meet again.
It looks thievy to this one.
The blessing of the Fox upon you.
Ah, the Prowler approaches.
Welcome, honored cat burglar.
Heh, heh.
I hate my life.
Do you have a proposition?
The horror. The horror.
Whatever shall we do?
We should get out of here.
Could it be the K'Sharra?
These are troubling signs.
This doesn't look good. Not good at all.
Welcome to Border Watch.
You're always welcome in Border Watch!
You are not one of us.
All honor to the Masque.
We honor the Rose and its bearer.
Get away from me....
Ah, there you are! It's good to see you again! No, really, I mean it!
Do you have a death wish, boy?
Do you have a death wish, girl?
You're back!
I can't wait until I gaze upon the Tears with my own eyes.
Dig up any more information?
Back again so soon I see.
I hope Julienne was helpful.
Aren't you supposed to be on your way to the Imperial City?
I'm hoping you can help.
Well...
Pardon me...
I'm so happy to see you again!
Did you fare well?
Ohhhh... what am I to do? They're gone... all gone.
I like Ushnar's dog.
Go away!
I just thought of something funny.
Sure, friend. Go right ahead. I have plenty of time to talk to you. Really, I do.
You remind me of a character from a book I'm reading.
I'm so full. Not the least bit hungry.
Looking, looking. Always looking, I am.
And a good day to you, sir!
And a good day to you, madam!
Be careful. They're listening.
You have purchased a fine piece of horseflesh.
You are a skillful thief. The guild is lucky to have you.
That's funny! I just thought I saw Sheogorath!
Oh, great... now I have to entertain a god.
I don't see Sheogorath. He's not real.
Lord!
I've heard what you do to dogs.
An honor, Lord.
May you walk on warm sands.
Warm day to you, friend.
Sugar and sands, friend.
Good friend. This is an honor.
Swift hunting, friend.
Its scent is unfamiliar.
It has no master?
You have words?
Speak while the sands are warm.
Khajiit has no words for you.
It comes near. What does it want?
To greet you? Or eat you?
Go away. Do not come back.
Can it speak? Can it make words?
M'aiq greets you.
Greetings, clan-mate.
This is Lynda Carter...
I think we'd better get that Gate closed.
Thanks for coming. We could use your help.
The Eternal Garden... I used to dream about coming here. The Master made it sound so wonderful.
I wonder how long we've been here? There's no way to keep track of time.
Just leave us alone. We have enough troubles here in the Savage Garden without you adding to them.
By the gods, what do you want?
Looking for other jobs? Don't look at me.
You must be the new slop drudge.
Hey! You said you would unlock the door!
Any news about the amulet?
Aha! There you are. Took you long enough to get here.
What? Still here?
Uhh, hello.
What took you so long?
It's about time you got here.
There are torches in the barrel.
Hello stranger.
Welcome to the Temple of the Ancestor Moths.
You may join us for morning prayers in the chapel.
I hope you have found your stay here pleasant.
We might be able to grow turnips next spring.
The latest batch of silk is ready, brother Hridi.
Brother Hridi, your homily was most inspiring.
The silk gardens are doing well, brother Hjar.
Brother Hjar, we must clean the chapel soon.
The cemetary is well tended, brother Holger.
Brother Holger, we need to prepare for the ritual of purity by the next full moon.
Are this month's silks ready?
Bastards. Take my flagon....
What more can I do for you?
You've forsaken the Demented and insulted the name of Arden-Sul. We have nothing to discuss.
Good day to you!
How kind of you to grace the Sacellum with your presence, my lady.
How kind of you to grace the Sacellum with your presence, my lord.
Another sheep returns to the flock.
Your Grace, you honor us with your presence.
I welcome you, Your Grace.
Well I'll be a spotted Snow Bear -- a customer!
Always a pleasure!
You need something? A room maybe?
By Ysmer's beard, not you again!
You do NOT belong in here!
You're an anxious one.
You look like you can hold your own in a fight.
Hey there, handsome.
Whatever I can do...
You again?
Eh?
You seem in good spirits... do you have good news?
Any new information come to light?
Good to see you again.
Welcome to Jensine's "Good As New" Merchandise!
Welcome back, milord.
Welcome back, milady.
Well met, milord.
Well met, milady.
Our conversations are done. There's nothing else to say.
Well, what're you just standing there for?
I thought that I was perfectly clear.
I guess I was wrong about you.
What're you looking at?
Something the matter with your eyes? There will be if you keep gawkin' at me like that.
What's your problem?
Hello and well met.
It is a privilege to see you again.
I'm at your disposal.
Ah, my savior. Back again for a visit are we?
That good-for-nothing husband's going to be very surprised if he crawls back here. Very surprised.
I could use some good news right about now.
Thank goodness someone that can help is here!
I've just discovered that water is actually heavier than air. Who would have thought?
A caliper a day makes the skyboat... wait, that doesn't rhyme.
Talking wears me out.
Yes, I can take a moment to talk with you.
Busy day today, isn't it?
Darkest blessings upon you.
You've got nice bones.
Killed anything?
I can hear the bones talking.
Something seems... amiss with you, milady.
Something seems... amiss with you, milord.
You don't appear well, milady. Perhaps you should rest.
You don't appear well, milord. Perhaps you should rest.
Good day, milady.
Good evening, milady.
Good day, milord.
Good evening, milord.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I can't wait... finally I'm away from that horrid store.
Excuse me...
I find it comforting to know when the end will come, and that there's nothing I can do about it.
My Lord! To what do I owe the honor?
Huh. I'd have thought a god would be taller than that.
Oh... I suppose I can make the effort to talk to you.
You choose to share your time with me? You humble me.
Well, here's a fine one! Speak freely.
Hail and welcome, friend. Hail!
Salute! Welcome! Please say your piece.
This is a grand day. Greetings.
Today's your lucky day, so let's hear it.
I take it you want something. Well, what is it?
What's your story?
May the wind be on your back.
Head on.
Say your piece or stand aside.
Someone should teach you some manners.
Bother me again, and you might live to regret it.
You remind me of a witch I once knew. I hate witches.
Get out of here before you get hurt.
Are you here to challenge me? I don't think so.
Greetings, son of Skyrim.
Greetings, daughter of Skyrim.
Well now, who do we have here?
Oh. You... Hi.
What are you waiting for? Kill me!
Damn Watchmen!
You're okay.
Whatcha got?
Don't butt in.
Thought I sent you to Harlun's Watch.
In sooth, mostly goodly done.
We is most pleased... eth... ified.
Hither to me, good varlet.
Speaketh you on.
Please don't tell anyone.
This is so embarrassing.
Didn't I send you to see Lord Rugdumph?
Why aren't you in Water's Edge?
Nice.
I don't suppose you've found those fugitives yet.
Shouldn't you be in Bravil? Being useful?
Back again, friend?
Have you brought me any Amber?
My weapons and armor are fashionable and deadly. For the sophisticated warrior.
Heard they made you master. Gods help us all.
What's on your mind, Guildmaster? Need me to kill something?
Greetings, Volendrung.
There you are! Welcome! Welcome!
Hail, my Brother!
Hail, my Sister!
If not for the Tenets, I would slay you where you stand!
But why, Sister? Why must I use stealth? Sneaking around in the shadows is so very... slow.
Many thanks. I'm preparing the ship for her return.
This ship doesn't move 'til I know that Ormil's safe.
Nice work.
Top deck clear yet?
I'm staying right here... where it's safe.
About time someone showed up.
Can I beg a favor of you?
Oh. It's you again.
I'm trying to find Itius Hayn.
I'd like to report a crime. Watch Captain Avidius stole all my money while I was shopping in Jensine's Merchandise.
You still here?
Yer botherin' me again?
Thanks again, buddy.
Remember me?
You are Weebam-Na?
Mogens is dead, the bastard!
Where's Fisherman's Rock?
Where's Weebam-Na?
What are you looking at?
I'm gonna go get me some black bows. Tag along if you like.
Time to relax.
You! You make me vomit!
Oh, the big tough slayer has returned... tremble in fear! Ahahaha!
You're always welcome here.
You there. I'm watching you. Not so close to the armory door.
Stop following me, you smelly cat!
Is that man-cat gone yet?
I don't like cats, which means I don't like you.
Hail, friend!
Hello, fellow adventurer!
Here kitty, kitty!
What can I help you with, sweetheart?
Cats. Everywhere.
Were you followed?
My Lord comes to rid us of the Scalon menace?
Have you seen anything cuter than that?!
Huh. That beast looks godly, doesn't it?
Welcome, Madgod.
I am honored, Lord.
I feel I can truly share with you, without fear.
A sincere welcome to you. May you be forever blessed.
A hail and hardy welcome, friend.
Such good company. Welcome.
Do not fear. I will assist you however I can.
May your kills be quick and many.
Ask and I will listen.
You seek my help?
Fight well.
Blade and bone. Speak to me.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Annoying creature.
I haven't time for fools.
By what right do you disturb me?
I've killed far worse than you.
Greetings, blood of Orsinium.
Are you all right, sire? We're clear, for now.
Stick close and you'll be alright.
The Blades have gotten the Emperor out of worse situations than this.
I don't like it. It's too quiet.
Stand aside, prisoner!
Keep quiet, and stay out of the way.
I told you to stay with the Emperor!
That's three more that won't be reporting back to their Master.
I haven't turned up anything new on my end yet.
Grandmaster, is this ... ?
I wish I could have helped you deal with the rest of those Mythic Dawn bastards. But it seems you did all right on your own.
What do you need, friend?
I'm a busy man. What is it?
I know someone's been murdered and we're all on edge. Just try to remain calm. I'll get to the bottom of this.
Welcome to the Chironasium.
You're a welcome sight.
Ah! Our newest member.
Can I help you, Pickpocket?
Psst. Over here.
I don't like the look of you. Keep moving.
Glad to see you!
I got nothing to say.
I've told the Watch that I don't know anything about the Gray Fox.
You must be the one.
This is not your affair.
You should be helping out Elante by now.
You and Maglir need to catch those thieves.
Shouldn't you be helping Norbert Lelles?
Don't you have a rat problem to be handling, boot?
Get to it, rat girl.
Get to it, rat boy.
Thanks, friend.
Praise the Nine!
Alessia, hear our prayer.
You've got a contract. Shouldn't you be in Bruma?
Welcome back, my lady.
Welcome back, my lord.
Your safe return speaks volumes of your success.
You must hurry!
Please, don't continue speaking with me... time is of the essence.
So good to see you.
An honor as always, Your Grace.
Thanks to me, things are going well here.
Guildmaster! How about that!
Yes, Guildmaster? What can I do for you?
You look like someone I might be able to help.
I'm not sure I can trust you. Why don't you just move along.
Well, well. Who might you be?
I can't help but smile when I see you, friend.
I didn't think Manheim allowed dogs in here.
You look upset that we deceived you. Please, don't be.
I heard you made contact with the gang. Beauties, aren't they?
Don't just stand around here.
Surprised to see us?
Have you located their hideaway?
Have any success at The Flowing Bowl?
I've already told you pretty much everything I know about their gang.
Back so soon?
Please hear me out.
I sing your praises and welcome you again.
My fate is in your hands.
Any luck yet?
Hello, fellow magician.
Can I ask you a favor?
I'm on my way to talk to Itius Hayn.
All that work gone to waste.
Sorry. Can't talk right now.
I can't believe it.
Got a lot to do here. We can talk later in Anvil.
My heart is broken.
Hello, my darling. Are you having a good day?
Hmm, what? Oh, hello.
Smells of prey....
If you need something, better talk to me.
Don't be shy.
I don't mind talking down to your level.
I've got your horse saddled and waiting for you.
The Gray Fox appreciates all you've done for the guild.
Hail, My Lord.
Greetings, My Lord. I am at your service.
The Madgod Himself! Come to get some advice from me!
What did I do to deserve this honor?
The pleasure is all mine.
I like what I see.
Well, what have we here?
Anytime, friend. I'm right here.
So, what's this about?
You've got my ear. Let's hear it.
Talk is free. What do you want?
What brings you here?
Nothing's keeping you here. So move on.
Keep walking.
If you're looking for trouble, you're getting very warm.
Get lost.
Greetings, child of the Ra Gada.
Ah, returned from the Fringe I see.
Why are you here? I thought I gave you a task to complete.
Back so soon, and glowing with success, I see!
Approach, Duke of Mania. The time is near and I am fading...
Approach, Duchess of Mania. The time is near and I am fading...
Approach, Duke of Dementia. The time is near and I am fading...
Approach, Duchess of Dementia. The time is near and I am fading...
The stench of fresh blood in the air is thick.
Hmmm? Oh, yes. The choice. Well, it's about time!
Shouldn't you be on your way to the Sacellum?
Shoo. Go. Begone. Things to do.
Well, look who's here! You! How about that?
I'm here for my book. Mankar Camoran's "Commentaries," Volume Three.
Ah, I sense a gambling man!
Ah, I sense a woman of chance!
By Azura, by Azura, by Azura! It's the Grand Champion! I can't believe it's you! Standing here! Next to me!
What do you want, Inquisitor?
Alive and kicking, are you? Welcome back.
Oh my. Look at you. You're in the thick of it now, aren't you?
You should be elsewhere right now, shouldn't you?
You? What do you want?
Welcome to the Imperial Orrery.
Greetings, child.
I... do not feel well. Please, excuse me.
Hey! I've been looking for you.
I have the diary!
I had the diary, but one of them stole it from me.
Get out of my way.
Is it midnight yet?
I've won the competition! My membership into the guild is assured.
Nothing to see here, citizen.
Welcome to my hideout.
The situation is not good. We have to act now.
A string of thefts should do the trick.
I hope the Imperial Watch goes away soon.
We've been waiting for you.
You aren't a member of the castle staff. What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you!
The Gray Fox is inside.
He's waiting inside.
What now, guildmate?
Help, help! You've got to do something!
Oh, look. You again.
No sweat.
Umbra will feast on your soul.
Get out of here while you can.
I bid you a most gracious welcome, my lady.
I bid you a most gracious welcome, my lord.
Tidings and welcome!
It fills me with joy to welcome you, Your Grace!
Hello, Your Grace.
Hello there! Can I cut you a deal?
Good to see you again. Do you need me to sharpen your blades?
Have you brought me some Madness Ore?
I have the sharpest blades. I test them out on myself before I put them on sale. They are deliciously keen.
[yawns]
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.
Seeing you again is like a blessing from the Night Mother herself!
What is it, Sister?
What is it, Brother?
You. I hoped Sithis would have claimed you by now.
[Gasp!] A burglar!
What is this interruption?
No! No, please don't hurt me! He paid me to do it!
Umm ... no time to talk.
Can't you see that I'm very busy?!
Leave me alone!  Why won't you all just leave me ALONE!!
Yes, yes.  I can see that you have no idea what is going on.  Excuse me.
Glad to see you are well.
Welcome to The Copious Coinpurse!
I thought we were done speaking.
You sure took your time.
You looking for me?
You got a problem?
Greetings and salutations!
Did you see my last performance? Did you like it?
Would you like a blade to cut open your foes?
No apples. Don't like apples. Got mutton? Fritters?
I've got fresh sticks. Guaranteed no leaves.
I'm not like them. Are you? Are you one of them?
I see you there. What?
A splash of blue here... a dab of green there...
A genuine masterpiece comes from the heart, not the mind.
Oh, what a delightful story! Brightens my day, it does.
I do so admire good books, they fill my mind with such fantastic images.
Every day is like being born. So new and so alive!
Rany Roo! Rany Roo!
I saw the Zaxer. And I magged it too. Aw, fribble!
Happy times! Happy days!
Tell the daen! Tell the daen! Karn sky is relfing.
Why look at you!
Oh, hello. Didn't realize anyone was there.
Yes? What'd I miss?
My Lord is looking sharp!
I must be dreaming!
Why can't they understand me?
Only you can eat the fruit of madness.
Ooh! You have a nice stick!
Can I show you my latest trick, Lord Sheogorath?
If there is anything I can do, I am humbly at your service.
I have a feeling that you and I are about to become very close.
Greetings and salutations.
This is a wondrous encounter. Welcome.
I'm so happy to see you, I could burst!
Interesting, go on.
From where do you hail?
I don't know if I can help you, but I'll try.
Do you want something from me?
I don't like you much.
Can't you find someone else to bother?
Can't you see I wish to be left alone!
You annoy even me.
I really don't want you around me.
Greetings, brother Bosmer.
Greetings, sister Bosmer.
You're trespassing! I warned you, and now the guards are coming to arrest you!
The guards are coming to arrest you for trespassing!
You just wouldn't leave! So I HAD to call the guards!
When they get here, the guards will arrest you for trespassing!
Soon the guards will arrest you for trespassing! I warned you!
You didn't leave, so I called the guards! Now you'll be arrested!
I warned you! Now the guards will arrest you for trespassing!
You're trespassing! I already called the guards!
You're going to get arrested if you don't leave right away!
Listen! I'm calling the guards if you don't leave, now!
Don't you understand me? You're trespassing, and must leave, or I'll call the guard!
I warned you! I'll call the guard if you don't leave!
I'll have you arrested if you don't leave! Now!
You MUST leave! If you don't, I'll call the guards!
You're trespassing! Leave now, or I call the guards!
Leave! Right now! Or I call the guards!
Get out! Now! Or I call the guards!
There must be some mistake. You must not be in here now.
You're not supposed to be here now. Leave, please.
Please leave. You shouldn't be here now.
You're trespassing. You should leave now.
You shouldn't be here now. I insist you leave.
You can't be here now. Please leave, and quickly.
You don't belong here. Please leave. Now.
You're trespassing. Get out.
Leave. Now. You're trespassing.
I warned you! You'll be arrested for trespassing!
You're trespassing! Get out, or I call the guards!
Where am I? What is this place? Arkay preserve me, I remember now ... hooded men grabbed me as I was leaving the Temple ...
We must get out of here! Come on!
By all that is holy, we must get out of this hellish place!
Thank you for saving me, friend. I don't know who you are, but it is clear that Akatosh guides you.
I am a priest in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Perhaps our paths will cross again one day.
Ah. You must be the one I got the message about. How can I help you?
My friend! It is good to see you again. You risked your life to save me, a stranger. You are truly among the blessed of Arkay's children.
As a small token of my gratitude, please allow me to share with you some of my small store of knowledge of the healing arts.
Arkay's blessings upon you.
I didn't come here to chat, Blue Team scum! Crawl home while you still can!
No talk, no talk! Only train! Branwen and Saliith, we become combatants in Arena! We fight, we be champions, we be famous!
Go Blue Team! Yeah, Blue Team! I always bet on the Blue Team! They never hold back! It's always crush, kill, maim, murder! Ha ha ha ha ha!
We've all agreed to let Diram be our spokesman. You'll find him in the inn, if you look very carefully.
None in the Fighters Guild will speak with you again. We have no desire to consort with common criminals.
You've committed yet another crime against your Fighters Guild brothers. Go speak with Donton. Until then, goodbye.
You've killed one of your Fighters Guild brothers! I'll have no more to do with you. If you have any hope of redemption, speak with Vilena Donton.
You've stolen from the Fighters Guild! Go speak with Vilena Donton. None of your brothers will deal with you until you atone for your actions.
What do you want, you... you... rat?
Yes? What can I do for you, my tight-lipped friend?
You are a breaker of Tenets, and have been eternally exiled from the Dark Brotherhood! Begone from here, and never return!
You have broken a Tenet, and have been exiled from the Dark Brotherhood! You must defeat the Wrath of Sithis to regain any status you once had!
Not here! Not in public! We must never speak to each other outside the Sanctuary! The risk of detection is too great!
What are you thinking, wearing something like that? Take it off at once!
Are you out of your mind? Take that robe off at once!
I see that you've been suspended from the guild. I've never had to deal with this before, but I do know what you'll need to do.
Speak with Raminus Polus at the Arcane University. He can lift the suspension, and get you back on track.
You have been found guilty of breaking guild rules, and have been suspended. Should you wish to clear your name, speak with Raminus Polus at once.
He can be found at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. I'm very disappointed in you.
Your actions have gotten you suspended from the guild.
There's nothing I can do for you. You'll have to speak with Raminus Polus at the Arcane University. Only he can lift the suspension.
I have another message from the Gray Fox.
You are looking well.
I never suspected it was Thadon's time, but what's done is done. I honor his choice.
You really shouldn't be here!
Once again, we meet.
Again we cross paths.
How can I help you this fine day?
Why do you speak to me, when you have the Chalice but have not yet returned it?
You've been speaking to Thadon. I can tell. He has a certain... effect on people.
Did he mention me, perhaps? Or was there something else you wanted to discuss?
Yes? How may I assist you? I'd be happy to help, if helping you means helping Thadon.
Yes, hatchling? Do you seek Thadon?
How can I help you... Sir? Miss? You all look alike to me. It's so hard to tell. Are you here to see Thadon?
Anything for my savior.
What should I do?
We need to get to safety.
Have you found "Necromancer's Moon"?
Err, look. If you're here for information, I'm afraid you'll have to find it on your own. I'm swamped right now; up to my ears in Necromancy.
Not practicing it, mind you. Wouldn't want anyone to think I was involved in that sort of thing. I simply meant researching it.
Get that artifact back to Irlav at the Arcane University. He's in a better position to study it than I am. Or to assign someone else to do it...
What's that you have there?
That looks important, whatever it is. I think you've really found something!
You'd best get that to Irlav back at the Imperial City as soon as possible. He'll want the mages there to examine it more closely.
Have you found anything interesting in the ruins?
If there's anything about Vahtacen you need explained, let me know. I'll help if I can.
You have business here? Don't tell me Jarol sent you...
What is it, Associate? Do you need something?
What's this? Black soul gems?
Oh, dear. This is worse than I'd expected.
All right. I'll just take these from you. I'll need them for my report to the Council.
Now, you didn't find any sort of recommendation? Very well. I shall write one myself, and include it in my report to the Council.
In light of the circumstances, I believe they'll find it more than adequate.
Have you found anything in Falcar's quarters?
I'm afraid some things have happened while you've been gone, Associate. It may affect your recommendation.
Greetings, citizen. Is there something I can do for you? Are you perhaps interested in joining the Mages Guild?
Are you here about joining the Mages Guild?
Greetings, brother! Greetings! I am Ocheeva, mistress of this Sanctuary. Lucien has told me all about you. I welcome you to the Dark Brotherhood!
You stand now in our Sanctuary. May it serve as your new home, a place of comfort and security whenever the need arises.
When you're ready for work, go and speak with Vicente Valtieri. He handles all assignments for new family members.
But before you go, please accept this gift from your new family. A unique set of armor, lighter than normal leather and black as the Void.
Now, I've kept you long enough. Vicente is waiting. You'll find him in his quarters. Go now, my child, and may Sithis go with you.
Greetings! Greetings! I am Ocheeva, mistress of this Sanctuary. Lucien has told me all about you. Let me welcome you to the Dark Brotherhood!
It is always a pleasure to welcome another Dark Sister into our ranks! Truly, the Night Mother smiles upon her trusted daughters!
But I've kept you long enough. Vicente is waiting. You'll find him in his quarters. Go now, my child, and may Sithis go with you.
Greetings once more. I know you must be eager to get to work. I think you'll find the task Vicente has available to be quite intriguing.
I see you've accepted the contract from Vicente. Very good. With every life you take, Sithis grows stronger, and the Brotherhood flourishes.
So, you are here to kill Motierre, eh? Well he's mine, and nothing will stand in my way!
The other guests are waiting for you at Summitmist Manor. I suggest you get going.
Well done! Not only did you kill the five guests, you acted as an agent of terror and grief. You have earned your reward and bonus, Assassin.
I lay upon you now the Night Mother's Blessing. May she walk with you always, and guide your hand as you act in accordance with the Five Tenets.
You managed to kill the five house guests, yes. But your inability to remain undetected will cost you. Your bonus for this contract is forfeit.
I must admit, I'm disappointed. This was an important contract, and you stumbled through it like a drunk. Leave me now, and think upon your failure.
So, are you ready to mingle with the doomed house guests? The contract is waiting.
Come on. Join the Fighters Guild. See the world, and get paid for it.
It's about time someone did something. These guys are killing my business!
You're Fighters Guild! Get them out of here!
Do you have the Mage's staff, Associate?
Any luck talking with Varon Vamori yet? It should be no trouble at all once you use that scroll.
Are you ready to earn your recommendation now?
Hello there, Associate. You're here for a recommendation, I presume. Are you prepared to earn it?
While Faelian walks the streets of the Imperial City, the Night Mother weeps in her restlessness. Kill this High Elf, and all will be well.
The High Elf Faelian now swims in the maelstrom of darkness at the feet of our Dread Father, Sithis. And, there were no witnesses to your handiwork.
Because of the discretion you exercised, Captain Phillida will not suspect the Dark Brotherhood was involved, and will not meddle in our affairs.
Here is your reward and bonus. Both have been well earned. Go now and rest, and may the Night Mother guard your dreams.
Here is your reward and bonus. Both have been well earned. In addition, you have been advanced to the rank of Eliminator.
I present to you now this key. It unlocks the well behind the Abandoned House above. Use it to gain hidden, quick access to this Sanctuary.
Go now and rest, and may the Night Mother haunt your dreams.
Yes, Faelian has been killed, but you did not exercise discretion. How many witnesses were there? We may never know.
But you can be sure Adamus Phillida will suspect the Dark Brotherhood was involved, and will launch an investigation.
I had hoped to avoid such an... irritation. Here is your reward, but the bonus is forfeit. Do try to be more careful next time, hmm?
Despite this recent lapse in professionalism, your overall efforts have been commendable. It's time you were advanced to the rank of Eliminator.
Ah, greetings. I have been waiting for you. As Vicente surely told you, your time working with him has come to an end.
From now on, you will receive all assignments directly from me. In fact, your next contract is available now.
I have another contract, when you're ready. One that will rely on your ability to remain fully undetected.
You've seen Lucien Lachance, then? Good, good. I know whatever task he has for you will be carried out with skill and discretion.
Ah, Assassin, I must speak with you. It is quite urgent. A sealed letter just arrived from a Dark Brotherhood courier.
I recognize this type of parcel. It contains sealed orders. It's addressed to you... from Lucien Lachance.
You must open these sealed orders immediately and follow their instructions to the letter. It would seem the Black Hand itself has a task for you.
Assassin! Why are you still here? Have you not opened your sealed orders? Go now! The Black Hand obviously has need of your abilities!
Adamus Phillida is dead! I could feel my heart swell with the Night Mother's love the moment that Imperial pig issued his last breath!
You have done a great service to the Dark Brotherhood today, Assassin. Your reward is well earned.
You also managed to leave Phillida's severed finger as a warning to his successor. Well done! Your bonus, 500 additional gold coins, is well earned.
Go now. Get some rest. Sithis knows you've earned it. When you're ready for another contract, you need only ask.
Sadly, you chose not to leave Phillida's severed finger as a warning to his successor. Your laziness has cost you your bonus, I'm afraid.
Now go. Get some rest. I'll have another contract ready for you shortly.
Adamus Phillida has been a thorn in the Dark Brotherhood's side for far too long. Kill the pig, so Sithis can enslave his soul for all eternity!
Greetings once more, assassin. When you're ready, I have a most important contract. One that has been sanctioned by the Black Hand itself.
Roderick may lie near death, but dead he is not. Until his soul has passed, our client -- and Sithis -- will not be satisfied.
Ah, so you infiltrated Fort Sutch, remained undetected, and replaced the medicine with the poison I provided. You are truly a master of shadow!
It pleases me greatly to offer you this reward, and a well-earned bonus. Go now. Rest. I'll have another contract ready whenever you are.
Roderick is dead, and Sithis is appeased. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the client who arranged this contract.
You were to avoid detection and kill Roderick by means of poison, yet you failed to follow these parameters.
Here is your reward, minus any bonus. It would seem you and Gogron share a similar... style. Now go, and do be more careful in the future.
I guess I've been expecting you, assassin. Don't try to deny it. I can see it in your eyes. You're Dark Brotherhood through and through.
Let me guess, it was Ocheeva, right? No, wait. Teinaava. Yes, he put you up to this, didn't he. Ocheeva was always too busy to even be bothered.
Well, you can kill me if you like. I'm afraid I won't make much of a challenge, though. The Argonian Royal Court already sent an Agent to do the job.
He failed, of course. His body's around here somewhere. But he got in a pretty good hit. If I don't get some rest I'm probably dead anyway.
So maybe I can appeal to your sense of good will, huh? Ha ha ha ha! You let me live, and I'll tell you where I stashed my treasure. Is it a deal?
I need to rest now, regain my strength. Don't forget to take the heart of the Argonian Agent. Present that to Teinaava, and he'll be none the wiser.
So, you didn't sell me out. I appreciate that. Well, I said I'd make it worth your while, so let me teach you a little something.
You've got to be light on your feet to make it around here, and that's something I'm good at. Maybe you can be, too. Take care.
You told her? What have you done? I'll be ruined! Thanks a lot.
Please, don't tell her what I've done. I can make it worth your while....
Yes? What can I do for you?
Heard you went over to the other side. Get out of my face.
Drink. It is time to go.
I can still smell the things. Look in the houses.
Come on. Drink up.
You'll need to be careful on this mission. Sometimes new recruits have complications. They are not used to our methods.
Take this. It will increase your skills in battle. We use it often. It is a good, good thing.
Move to the training area, downstairs. We will speak more there.
What is it you want? Come for a job?
I shouldn't say any more... but you have treated me so well. Perhaps I can trust you.
Stop! Please! What is it? What more do you want?
Perhaps you do understand. Perhaps I can help you. A little.
Yes, yes! Enough! What? I'll tell you what you want!
What do you want? Is it time for torture? Hah! Do your worst.
I won't talk to you! Never! Do your worst.
I am beaten. Leave me alone.
You are a fool to be here.
What do you want? Get away from me!
Step aside! I'm going to win the right to join the guild. You can't beat me.
You wish to join the Thieves Guild too? Maybe we will soon be brothers in the shadow. Only Armand can say.
The Count is on his way. Please, remain here and be patient.
You have completed your tasks for the Count, have you not? Then please, wait here while I inform him.
The Count appreciates your efforts, but as the vampires have not yet been dealt with, he has no interest in seeing you at this time.
You are here to see the Count, yes? He has been expecting you. Please, wait here. I shall inform him of your arrival.
It is good to see you again! I have a message for you from the Gray Fox.
I am honored to be entrusted by the Gray Fox himself to run these errands.
I have another mesage from the Gray Fox. You must be very important!
What is your wish, you who have been blessed by our Lady's voice?
You have been told what you must do to speak with our Lady. What more do you ask of us?
I'm trying to concentrate. If you don't mind...?
I used to be a dog. I got better. Not a better dog, though. I'm a terrible dog now. Tomorrow...who knows? Ravel may know. Talk to him.
We're back. Thank Peryite!
Our time must now be spent in prayer. Perfect order must be achieved.
[The Peryite worshipper says nothing.]
Greetings, favored of Hircine.
You have been graced with the presence of Hircine. Do not fail him, lest you be hunted for the rest of your days.
You have been told what you need to know. Your path is now your own.
You've found this place. Now you must find your way within.
Blessed are you who wields the Goldbrand.
You have returned, and you are not a corpse. Boethia may be pleased by this.
Boethia has opened a portal for you. Consider yourself lucky. You have the chance to die in Boethia's service.
You have been told all that is necessary. Approach the shrine or do not.
There's nothing to see here. Why don't you just go home?
It gives me great pleasure to see you again, my lord.
Um... did you know that you're on fire?
The holy Flame of Agnon! You've brought it back to light the Great Torch of New Sheoth!
Ah, the Flame of Agnon shines again! Soon the Great Torch will flare with the pure light of Dementia!
Ah, you're the one who lit the Great Torch for us. Well done!
Every time I see the Torch shining with the flame of Dementia, I blame you.
I welcome you to our family, and this Sanctuary. May you find yourself at home here, in the loving embrace of our Lady the Night Mother.
You are Argonian, yes, but you are no Shadowscale! What chaos you must have known as a hatchling! Thank Sithis you have come home at last. Welcome.
Ah, dear friend, may I steal a moment of your time? I have a rather delicate situation I was hoping you could help me with.
This is a personal matter, and will have no bearing on your standing within the Dark Brotherhood. Would you like to hear more?
It's good to see you again! I hope your contracts have been giving you much pleasure.
Hello. What is it I can do for you?
Why do you bother me?
Greetings, Brother. I do hope you are well.
Greetings, Sister. I do hope you are well.
Ah, have you reconsidered my offer? Do you wish to eliminate that treasonous Shadowscale for me?
You come speak with me, yet you do not bear Scar-Tail's heart. Please, you must slay that traitorous snake so Ocheeva and I can find peace!
Ha! Yes! That is an Argonian heart, of that I am sure! You have slain Scar-Tail! Well done! Please, take these boots as payment for your services!
They are called the Boots of Bloody Bounding, and carry a powerful enchantment. I'm sure you will find them most useful.
Please, let me out of here! You must help me escape. I think these creatures plan to do something horrible to me tonight!
Hello, I don't think we've met.  Are you new in town?
I'm don't mean to impose, but I'm hoping you can help me.  My daughter, Dar-Ma is missing and I don't know what to do.
Please, Seridur is anxious for your report.
It's good to see you again. I'm so sorry that we didn't realize Seridur's deception.
How can I be of service?
Hear out Seridur, first. Then we'll speak.
I see you slept well. Welcome home.
It's so difficult to be here and watch him not knowing how much he may be suffering.
Are you prepared to enter the Dreamworld?
Well, as you can see, Henantier's right here and he's trapped in his Dreamworld.
It's just this way, not much farther.
Are you ready to follow me to Henantier?
What brings you to me today, friend?
I don't suppose you could help me locate my friend Henantier could you?
Please, wait here. I shall let the Count know you are waiting for him.
The Count needs more time. He will see you when he is ready.
The Count awaits within. Please, do not delay.
Please just follow me.
Welcome back. Have you completed your task for the Count?
Please wait in the Hall. The Count will be with you shortly.
Greetings. Do you have business at Castle Skingrad?
Good luck with Mazoga.
I'm going to see Mazoga. Come along, if you like.
I'm Weebam-Na. What do you want?
Please go away. I have no wish to speak to you.
Now that Henantier has returned, things are as they should be.
This thing you've done goes beyond what I would have expected from you. You've chosen a dark path, and I shall help you get there sooner!
What can the Order help you with, sister?
What can the Order help you with, brother?
I will never forget your brave rescue of my daughter.  What can I do for you today?
My hero!
Hello my friend.  I will never forget your daring rescue.  What can I do for you?
I'm always glad to see you, handsome.
Hello friend. Stay a while and watch the sheep with me!
We'll never forget how you saved us from Ancotar's crazy magic. What can I do for you?
I'm not normally a bitter person, but you are not welcome here.
Get back, you filthy beast! I'll have nothing to do with the likes of you!
No, no! Stay away from me!
You won't get any of my blood! Get away from me!
You have passed your test. Well done. I shall be more than happy to train you in the skill of Alteration from now on.
I'm afraid you have failed the test. I warned you to stay close. We can try again some other time, perhaps.
We are not yet done with your test. When you have passed or failed, then we may have reason to speak.
The Fork! Songs of bringing? The Fork for Big-Head?
The Fork for Big Head. Oh, where has Master put the Fork? It sings alone. Far from home. Sad, sad Fork. Sad, sad Big-Head.
As I live and breathe! The Gray Fox! It's an honor.
The infamous Gray Fox! You're the most famous thief in the world!
Sing to Big Head. Sing to him.
Whadda you need?
Good to see you. We should have a drink sometime.
Stay for a while. And stay away from my wife.
What? I'm in kind of a hurry.
Welcome to the Five Riders Stables! I have many fine horses for sale. Okay, so only one, but it is a fine Paint horse.
Welcome to the Five Riders Stables!
Sadly I don't have any horses to sell. You bought our last Paint horse.
Are you looking for a fence?
I'm only askin' for enough to feed me kids.
One more coin and I can git a pair of shoes.
Please be generous, kind sir.
I can see you are a kind soul, gentle lady.
I'm so hungry.
I can eat for a day with a single coin.
Me children will thank ya for yer help.
I'm savin' up enough for some medicine.
You were Martin's friend, weren't you? You were fortunate to have known him.
Any friend of Martin's is a friend of mine. How can I help you?
Greetings, Champion! I'm at your service.
I'm honored to speak to the Champion of Cyrodiil! What do you need?
The bards will be busy composing songs in your honor for years to come. To think that we lived through such times!
Perhaps Anvil will not go the way of Kvatch, thanks to you. Well done.
They call me 'Hauls-Ropes-Faster'. I don't care. They can't pronounce my Black Marsh name, anyway.
My name's Quill-Weave. I've had some success selling stories about the lives of the lower and criminal classes.
Chorrol breathes easier thanks to you. We are all in your debt.
Welcome to the Mages Guild. I'm Teekeeus. What can I do for you?
I conduct business here. No offense, but I haven't got time for small talk.
Perhaps I wasn't clear. I cannot spare time to talk with you. Would you be so kind as to leave me alone?
Only the finest wares to buy and barter at Northern Goods and Trades. I'm Seed-Neeus, the proprietor. How can I help you?
The gate may be closed, but some say you slew the Count's son in the process. Is this what defines a hero?
Your reputation precedes you, Gate-Closer, Scourge of Oblivion, Hero of Kvatch!
Books. I sell books. Go ahead. Look. Buy some.
I'm Deetsan. Magician. Mages Guild, that is.
That Oblivion Gate threatened us all, yet only you took action to destroy it. You have my thanks, Hero.
I'm Hal-Liurz, Count Skingrad's steward. The Count does not accept unsolicited visitors, I'm afraid. I apologize for the inconvenience.
Ah-Malz of the Fighters Guild. Welcome to Skingrad County. Come hunting goblins, have you?
What? Who are you? Oh... who cares. I'm Druja. You want something? Or you just practicing your Cyrodilic?
Tar-Meena. This is my Mystic Archives. Keep it neat. Keep it quiet. No eating in the stacks.
I'm Gin-Wulm. I just work here. You want to buy, talk to Varnado or Maro Rufus.
I am Wumeek. Gods commend you.
I am Geem Jasaiin. We come from Black Marsh to the city to work the water ways and water trades.
I work as a guard at Umbacano Manor. My name is Usheeja.
Hearth and fortune. Grey-Throat, I am called. You are not known to me.
Hey, you look just like your statue! What can I do for you?
Hail, Savior of Bruma!
I am honored to speak to the hero of the Battle of Bruma. What can I do for you?
Well done. Bruma will never fall while you and our intrepid Captain Burd are on duty!
At least the Oblivion Gate outside the city is gone. Although news from the rest of the Empire is still just as bad as ever.
I am the healer, Marz of Black Marsh. By the grace of Mara, I am available as an Advanced Trainer in Restoration.
Kud-Ei. I'm in charge here, and an Advanced Trainer in Illusion to boot, so I don't have a lot of time to stand around and chat.
Does anyone see City-Swimmer? Is he gliding beneath the silver water? Is he creeping 'round a corner, hugging a wall, silent as a shadow in the dark?
No! I am here! I stand proud before you, City-Swimmer, trainer of the prospective Sneaker, the sly sliding unseen!
The common folk of Leyawiin recognize your valor, even if Count Terentius does not. What do you need, friend?
Welcome, stranger, to the Five Claws. Food and beds, cheap and good, but most of all, your hostess promises, always clean!
Witseidutsei gives you her guarantee! Everything, clean, always, or you do not pay!
The Dividing Line between a live hero and a dead one is a sharp sword. Get the best you can afford from Tun-Zeeus...
... Because you don't want to be on the dead guy side of the line, do you?
On-Staya Sundew. Castle Leyawiin's steward. And chief advisor to Count Marius Caro. In theory...
I'm Dar Jee. I'm a Khajiit in disguise. Want to see me lick my butt?
Hahaha! That one never gets old!
Lieutenant Rana, Blackwood Company.
I am Geel. Sergeant-of-Sharpshooters, Blackwood Company.
Oleed-Ei, Blackwood Company Master-of-Assassins.
My name is Numeen.  Have you seen that no-good rascal husband of mine, Mahei? Gods know what he is up to this time...
I am Mahei... that poor fellow who is chased everywhere by that nagging fishwife, Numeen.
Please. Just don't mention me to her, or she will burst into one of her tirades...
Rats. Hate them. HATE them. Every one. Gonna hunt them down and chop them all to tiny bits.
Oh. Did I say that out loud? Excuse me. I'm Weebam-Na, the hunter. You got to excuse me. I got rats on the mind.
I'm Bejeen. I'm a hunter, and Weebam-Na's partner. I hope he didn't bother you about the rat thing. He's gone totally rat-cuckoo, I'm afraid.
I'm Otumeel. But I didn't do anything. Really. It wasn't me.
Hahaha! No! Really! It wasn't me! Never!
I'm Beelei. You... you came from out there? And you survived? Then how do I know you're not one of THEM?
It's awful out there in the world, isn't it? Best to just stay at home, inside... where it's safe.
I am Wide-Eye, Steward to His Grace, the greatest Duke of Mania in all of history, Thadon. He is my reason for being. My purpose in life.
Are you here to see Thadon? I would be, if I were you. Thankfully, I already have cause to speak to him every day.
So many forks. Not the True Fork. Only it sings. Have you the Fork for Big Head? Fork that sings? Fork that rings?
Pretty, pretty forks. Singing sad, sad songs. Do you hear them?
What do you need, Sparkles? I'm always here. Can't afford to sleep. Can't be too careful.
So far, so good. If this world's a dream, I'm not waking up.
Who am I? How about a failure, a fraud, an utter sham. I'm a poet without merit, a slave to my own stupidity and will likely ruin your day.
Why should I get up to greet the day when every living thing mocks me?
Ah, a stranger in town. But as I always say, a stranger is just a friend I haven't met yet!
Hey, friend, do you think you could help me out? I'm caught a bit short at the moment... anything at all would be much appreciated.
What do you need, friend? Anything for you.
Hey, got any apples? Or carrots? Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?
My feet hurt so bad. I could sure use a new pair of shoes. Can you help me out? Please?
Do you think you can spare a little something for an old friend? You know I'm good for it.
May all my children serve you well, Lord Sheogorath.
My Lord comes to Deepwallow to make it safe?
Singings and ringings to you, Lord Sheogorath.
My Lord, you honor me with your presence.
A drink to the health of our Lord!
I'd like my mind back, if you please. Or not. It's really up to you, Lord Sheogorath.
Blessings of the Madgod.
Your lips to His ears.
Speak, madwoman.
Speak, madman.
I'm told you closed the Oblivion Gate. I'm amazed. Thank you, on behalf of all Kvatch's refugees.
We've been hit hard. But we'll come back.
You again. What is it this time?
Yes? How should I act?
A pleasure to speak with you.
It's my pleasure. Please continue.
I hope I can help.
Go ahead, please.
This is official business. Do not interfere.
I've just received word from the Countess of Bruma that an Oblivion Gate has opened outside the city.
It seems that the Mythic Dawn are putting their plan to attack Bruma into motion.
Since you've dealt with these Gates before, I'd like you to help the Countess's guard close this gate.
Once they've seen how it's done, they should be able to handle any new gates on their own.
Good work. Captain Burd and his guardsmen should be able to handle any additional Gates, at least for now.
But the Bruma Guard cannot defend the city indefinitely. The daedra of Oblivion are innumerable; the guardsmen of Bruma are not.
We need to gather what allies we can before Bruma is hopelessly besieged.
If the Mythic Dawn manages to open a Great Gate here, the city will need a stronger garrison for there to be any hope of defending it.
You should speak to the rulers of the other cities of Cyrodiil, as well as the Elder Council. Ask them to send aid to Bruma before it is too late.
Don't forget, Captain Burd needs your help to close the Oblivion Gate outside of Bruma.
You should be proud of what you did here today, but remember, the war is not yet over.
Until you reclaim the Amulet and Martin lights the Dragonfires, the enemy will not be truly defeated.
Time is pressing. Martin must relight the Dragonfires before the enemy can stop us.
We have to get Martin to the Temple of the One or Mehrunes Dagon has won after all.
I hope Martin knows what to do now. I will die by his side, if this is the end.
You must enter the portal to Camoran's Paradise and reclaim the Amulet of Kings!
Once you're rested and equipped, you should have Martin open the portal to Camoran's Paradise immediately.
Don't give the enemy a chance to recover from their defeat.
You've done it! Victory is within our grasp! Give the Amulet to Martin at once!
Are you here to end this nightmare, and free us all from the Savage Garden?
What do you want, mortal?
Your first priority now should be to find Martin and bring him back here.
We must protect Martin during the battle. He is the Empire's last hope.
I hope Martin knows what he's doing with that evil book. I fear for what it could do to him if he's not careful.
What have you learned about the spies?
Good work locating the Shrine of Dagon. If you can retrieve the Amulet of Kings, we may yet prevail.
You need to get the Mysterium Xarxes from the Mythic Dawn's Shrine of Dagon. It is our only hope to retrieve the Amulet of Kings.
Thank Talos you've returned safely!
Do you have the Amulet?
You should talk to Martin. He'll want to see the Mysterium Xarxes right away.
You have proven yourself a loyal servant of the Empire, as worthy as any of the Blades to stand by Martin's side during this crisis.
As the Grandmaster of the Blades, I would be honored to accept you into our order. Will you join us?
It is good to be back here. It raises my spirits just to walk these ancient halls again. We will prevail. We must prevail!
Move along, friend.
You're back. Thank Talos!
They attacked without warning. I was praying in the Chapel when I heard Prior Maborel shout. I had just time to arm myself.
The Amulet of Kings! I fear that was the target of this attack. I kept it in a secret room in Weynon House.
We need to go see if it is safe.
The Amulet ... is it safe?
They've taken it! The Amulet of Kings is gone! The enemy has defeated us at every turn!
As a Blade, my place is at Martin's side.
Hello. I'm Brother Jauffre. Can I help you?
I'm Brother Jauffre. What do you want?
Yes? Can I help you?
So, Martin wants you to recover the Armor of Tiber Septim? I wish there was another way.
The Armor is in the Shrine of Tiber Septim, in the catacombs beneath the ruins of Sancre Tor. A holy place, once.
But Sancre Tor became evil long ago. No one has returned from the Shrine of Tiber Septim for many lifetimes.
I'm worried about Martin. He does nothing but pore over that evil book all day.
Have you recovered the Armor of Tiber Septim yet? We need to open the gate to Camoran's Paradise as soon as Martin deciphers the whole ritual.
We have fulfilled our last duty. We go now to Aetherius without shame. Farewell.
At long last ... you have freed me. Now I can finally complete my lord's last request.
Stand aside in the name of Tiber Septim and the Blades! Hinder me at your peril!
Please forgive me, but I'm afraid I haven't got time to talk right now. One of the other Blades should be able to assist you. Try Jena or Steffan.
Sorry, but I'm too busy to talk right now. Try one of the other Blades. Perhaps Roliand or Cyrus?
I haven't time to talk right now, I'm afraid. But I'm sure one of the other Blades can help. Try speaking with Belisarius, or Caroline.
I have nothing to say to you.
What can I do for you, sir?
What can I do for you, ma'am?
You should be gathering the items Martin needs for the Mysterium Xarxes ritual. There's no time to lose.
A victory beyond hope! You and Martin defeated Mehrunes Dagon in the very moment of his triumph! All hail the Champion of Tamriel!
What can I do for you, Blade?
What can I do for you, Savior of Tamriel?
I know that you are on an important mission for the Blades. Please, if you need a horse, take mine from the Priory stables.
So, you're the famous Hero of Kvatch.
I'm a bit busy here!
Congratulations on your victory. Your fame was well-deserved, it seems.
I wish I could have been at the battle. It sounds like you taught Mehrunes Dagon's boys a lesson they won't soon forget.
I come to the Arena any chance I get! Once, I got hit in the eye with some spraying blood, and went blind for three days! Now THAT was a good match!
Aggh! I hate these disgusting Arena matches! I'm here looking for my husband, Roderick! If he loses any more of our money he's a dead man...
What do you require, Arch-Mage?
What is it, Arch-Mage?
How may I assist you, Arch-Mage?
I am sorry, fellow magister, but I don't have time to talk right now. My studies keep me very busy, as you can well imagine!
Damn these interruptions! Can't you see I'm busy? Do you think just anyone gets into the Arcane University? Now leave me alone!
Ah, I see you've been successful in the Fringe. How can I assist you, Your Grace?
Do you require assistance with the task Sheogorath has given you?
Your Grace, has Relmyna sent you on an errand? Do you need help with your task?
Ah, is Your Grace having difficulty with his choices?
I see it's back to the Fringe once again, Your Grace.
Your Grace, why disturb this ceremony? Oh,  I must have come accidentally. I should come when it is more appropriate. My apologies.
Congratulations on creating the Gatekeeper, Your Grace.
No way! I'm never talking to you, ever again! After she found out what I told you... she... she... you have no idea what Pain is until she... she...
Just leave me alone -- go away!
The Gatekeeper walks again. This is good. Now maybe Relmyna will be in a better mood around here.
Did you hear that? Oh boy...
You are here to help rebuild the Gatekeeper. That is very good of you... considering what you did to him.
So many strange noises here. People screaming, animals dying. But I've learned so much... so much.
Be careful of Relmyna's temper. She... she has ways of extracting obedience.
Greetings! Seeing you just makes me feel safer!
The Council requires more time. Please, be patient. I will have work for you soon enough.
My attention is focused on the Council right now. I will need you soon enough; I need more time.
Before we continue, you should speak to Raminus Polus about your advancement within the guild.
Oh, your guild privileges have been suspended. You should speak with Raminus Polus at the Arcane University to rectify the situation.
Oh, you just go talk to Raminus Polus at the Arcane University, and he'll have things straightened out in no time.
Until then, I'm afraid it wouldn't be in my best interests to be seen talking to you. You understand, of course.
Time is short. You must speak to Sheogorath immediately.
He is gone, but hope is not lost. We have a rare opportunity here, but I hesitate to do what must be done.
If the Throne of Madness remains empty when Jyggalag storms the palace, he will prevail. But there is a chance that the throne may not be empty.
Hurry to Dyus. Do as he asks. No danger is too great.
The Howling Halls, is it? It's been some time since I last saw this place.
Milchar. Home to the Tree of Shades -- one of my favorite features of this Realm.
You've spoken to Dyus, yes? Then there is little more to say. Do as he instructs -- recreate the Staff of Sheogorath before it is too late.
Time grows ever shorter. I implore you -- deliver your precious cargo to Dyus with haste.
Ah, you're back. You may have noticed that we have a... bit of a problem.
Ah, there you are. It seems that we have a... bit of a problem. It's the Font of Madness... no doubt you were on your way there just now.
As I feared. The sickness is spreading through the Fountainhead.
Do not delay. If the Font of Madness itself becomes Ordered, all your victories over Jyggalag will have been in vain.
Your task is only half done. The Font will not be fully cleansed while Order pollutes one of the pools that feed it.
You've done well. Already I can feel the Fountainhead renewing itself, flushing the taint of Order from its veins.
At this time, you have enough to go on. Now, get back to it!
One of your military minions was looking for you. It sounded urgent, but I'm afraid I don't know the details.
What a mess! I would prefer to speak in the palace. Shall we?
I don't mean to point out the obvious... but isn't that Jyggalag right over there? He doesn't look very pleased to find you here, does he?
If you're finding Jyggalag a bit overwhelming in person, you might consider using your Staff. It may prove effective in this battle.
It appears to me that Jyggalag is strengthened by these obelisks that are disfiguring the Palace lawn. Perhaps shutting them down would help?
It seems that you've finally gotten Jyggalag's full attention.
Cleansing the Tree seems to have convinced him that the direct approach was his only option.
I would congratulate you, but perhaps that should wait until after you've prevented Order from storming the Palace.
Perhaps further conversation should wait until things are a bit more... relaxed? You seem to have your hands full at the moment.
Well done. I suppose you deserve your new post. Now, if only you stay alive long enough to enjoy it....
Well? What are you waiting for? You have the blood, and the altar awaits.
Ugh. How messy. Well, now that you possess Thadon's drug-tainted blood, I'd make my way to the Sacellum as soon as possible.
Lord Sheogorath doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Do I have to tell you everything?
You need his blood, so take it!
You've done it! Color me impressed. On second thought, don't. I like what I'm wearing.
All that remains is to watch the soon to be late Thadon eat his food and smile with glee as his heart goes "boom."
Dinner is promptly at 8 o'clock and those who are late don't get Alocasia Fruit Cup!
Choices, choices. Well, now that you've liberated some Greenmote from the Silo, you need to add it to Thadon's food and wine.
The kitchens are a good place to start, but they are deep in his quarters guarded by more Saints.
So once again you have choices; to sneak or to kill. Be cautious, these Saints are some of his most elite.
Watch your step in the Silo. Thadon doesn't want just anyone traipsing through there.
You can count on the presence of the Golden Saints to defend his impressive store of Greenmote.
You can try to sneak by them or you may elect to eliminate them, but the latter is hardly the way of Mania, now is it?
So it's Greenmote you need, eh? Well, I think it's fairly clear who knows where that powdery substance is stored.
Follow Wide-Eye. I think she mentioned an errand she runs? That would be your best bet.
Confused already? How very disappointing.
If I were you, and thank Sheogorath that I'm not, I would begin with the people who spend their day closest to Thadon.
Yes? Do you require assistance?
Have you recovered either the Bloodworm Helm, or the Necromancer's Amulet?
Have you recovered the Bloodworm Helm?
At the worst possible time, the Council is in ruins.
A course of action could not be agreed upon. Some felt that we are in danger of being exterminated, and that it is time to fight back.
Others felt it appropriate to fight fire with fire, as it were. The Council has shattered, and artifacts have been lost.
The Necromancer's Amulet and the Bloodworm Helm have been taken.
Any luck finding J'skar?
Why, hello there!
You must be new. Oh, it's so nice to see new faces in the guild!
If you ever need anything, just let me know. I have friends in all sorts of high places, you know, so I can get things done that others can't.
And if I can do anything for you, I'd be happy to! Someday, maybe you could return the favor!
Hello, Associate. If you need anything, just let me know.
You've done well. The Gold Road should be a little safer for now.
You should return to Anvil and let Carahil know the work is complete. We'll remain here and clean things up.
Not now!
Welcome to the Brina Cross Inn. Can I interest you in something to eat, or perhaps a bed for the night?
Did I not tell you to avoid contact with us? Travel along the road, and act normally. We shall be shadowing you.
You have your orders. Now carry them out.
We should speak in your room, where it is private. Not here.
You don't follow orders well, do you? You were supposed to find me before you spoke to anyone else here.
We shall look forward instead of back, however. You still have work to do.
Rest here for the night, and then continue along the Gold Road, heading east towards Kvatch.
I shall be following out of sight, along with a fellow Battlemage. Make no attempts to speak to us; trust that we will protect you.
Should you be confronted by this cowardly mage, do not hesitate to protect yourself with whatever means possible.
Once the mage has revealed himself, we will step in and settle the matter quickly. Now, get yourself some sleep. You'll need to be well-rested.
All right, it should be safe to speak here.
Once you've rested here, you need to continue along the Gold Road, heading east towards Kvatch.
Should you be confronted by this cowardly mage, do not hesitate to protect yourself by whatever means possible.
Don't speak to me further until you've rented a room. Then I'll come find you.
Hello, stranger. What can I do for you?
Carahil has sent you, has she not?
Go and speak with Christophe. Rent a room for the night. Once you have your room, I will meet you there.
If anyone asks, you are a traveling merchant, nothing more. Do not say otherwise to anyone.
No, friend. I'm afraid I don't know the way to Cheydhinhal, but good luck in your travels. Please excuse me.
You're here about that recommendation, I presume. I'll need to speak with Erthor before I write it.
I trust you have good reason for interrupting me?
Hmm, what? I'm rather busy right now.
Oh, is this about joining the Mages Guild? I suppose I could spare the time, if necessary.
Hello there! Are you here to join the Mages Guild?
Baenlin is dead, yes, but you did not fulfill the contract precisely as directed. I will grant your reward of gold, but the bonus is forfeit.
Despite this misfortune, you are ready for advancement. I appoint you Slayer for the Dark Brotherhood. Now go, and continue to serve Sithis well.
So, the accident has been staged, and Baenlin lies dead. Well done! You have more than earned your reward and bonus.
I present to you this dagger. It's an enchanted blade, known as Sufferthorn. Its prick is deadly, I assure you.
Yes, you are quite an asset to this Sanctuary. In fact, I believe you are ready for advancement. I hereby appoint you Slayer. Well done!
Now go, child of Sithis. Go and rest. You'll need it.
Every moment that Baenlin draws breath is an affront to Sithis and the Night Mother. Fulfill the contract and honor the Brotherhood as you should.
Who are you? What do you want? I ain't done nothin'!
Warmest greetings to you. I trust you've already spoken with Ocheeva? I am Vicente Valtieri. I provide assignments for all new family members.
Please, do not let my appearance... unnerve you. The needs and Tenets of the Dark Brotherhood come before my own needs as a vampire.
Now, if you're ready to get to work, I can provide you with your first contract.
I trust you've had time to get settled? The contract is available whenever you are.
I have a special contract that needs fulfillment. In truth, I don't wish to offer it to any other family member. I've come to rely on your abilities.
So, the pirate has been eliminated. Excellent. No one will mourn his passing, and Sithis has been appeased.
Please accept this Black Band as your reward. It is a ring whose powers are quite useful to those who value... discretion.
Let's not waste time on pleasantries. Gaston Tussaud is still alive, and it's your job to remedy that. I suggest you tend to your duties.
What in blazes! You ain't one of me crew! Ye best start explainin' yerself, mate, if ye want to get off this ship alive!
I'm glad you've returned. The contract is waiting, if you're ready.
Back for more? It just so happens I have another contract available, one that requires an expert in infiltration.
Why does Valen Dreth still live? Breaking into the Imperial Prison is difficult, I know, but the contract must be fulfilled.
So, you infiltrated the Imperial Prison, eliminated Valen Dreth, and killed not one guard. Most excellent!
In addition to your standard reward, I present to you this bonus. Behold, the Scales of Pitiless Justice!
While carried, the scales will magically enhance your Strength, Intelligence and Agility... but diminish your Personality. A powerful tool indeed.
Valen Dreth lies dead, but why the unsanctioned bloodshed? You seem to lack... discipline. Here is your reward, but I'm afraid the bonus is forfeit.
Oh! Well... um, hello. You must be the one Lucien Lachance told me about. I've been expecting you. We haven't got much time, I'm afraid.
I borrowed quite a bit of gold from some underworld types.  I... I missed a payment. Now they don't even want the money. They say I insulted them!
They've sent an enforcer to kill me! His name is Hides-His-Heart, and he's on his way here now! That's why I hired you! So you can fake my death!
Now is not the time!
Ohhh... I'm a bit stiff, but quite fine otherwise. Ah yes, the Undercroft. My family members are buried here, you know.
Which... um... leads me to something I may have failed to mention before. My ancestors will see my "revival" as a desecration of their tomb.
This Undercroft is... well... quite cursed. Any desecration will cause my ancestors to rise from their graves and defend their resting place.
I can hear them coming as we speak! You must protect me... escort me to the Gray Mare where I can buy passage out of Chorrol!
*Gasp!* Here they come! Oh my, Aunt Margaret! You are looking the worse for wear...
Ah, so Motierre has escaped? Well done! As payment, I am pleased to award you this amulet, Cruelty's Heart, as well as another advancement in rank.
I hereby bestow upon you the title of Eliminator. Your blood is cold, your heart hard. You exemplify everything the Dark Brotherhood stands for.
Is it not safe? Do you want me to wait here?
Ah, the Gray Mare! From here I will be able to arrange for transportation out of Cyrodiil! You have served me well, assassin.
Francois is forever in your debt! Farewell!
Thanks again, assassin. Your services have been invaluable. Soon I will find passage out of Cyrodiil, and be rid of those moneylenders forever!
So, the enforcer Hides-His-Heart has been killed. He was to bear witness to Motierre's death, and report back to his superiors.
By failing to fulfill this contract, you have brought shame upon us all. Leave me now, and contemplate your uselessness as a member of this family.
So, Francois Motierre has been killed. He hired us, sacrificed his own mother's blood, and we could not even fulfill our end of the bargain.
The sixth guest has finally arrived! Well it's about time! Do you know how long we've been waiting? It seems like an age!
Whoever invited us here must at least know us, don't you think? In any event, we're all stuck here together, so we might as well get acquainted.
The rest of us have already traded introductions. I'm Matilde Petit. The others are Nels the Naughty, Neville, Dovesi Dran and Primo Antonius.
Now, who might you be? Please, tell us a little bit about yourself.
Have you spoken to the other guests yet? I suggest you get to know everyone. Who knows how long we'll be stuck in this house together?
Now you listen to me. I don't like you. Understand? So why don't we both just stay out of each other's way, and be done with it.
Hello, dear! Listen, I've been thinking. Why don't we form a kind of alliance? If either one of us finds the chest of gold, we split it, 50/50!
With the two of us working together, we're sure to find the chest before anyone else. What do you say? Do you want to team up?
Oh, hello sweetie. So, no luck yet in finding the gold, I gather? I've been looking as well, but haven't found so much as a clue.
What do you want from me? For all I know, you could be the killer!
Oh, this is just horrible! Who could do such a thing? Who could kill a defenseless person in cold blood? Greed truly brings out the worst in people.
Please, sweetie, stay close to me.  The killer might strike again, whoever he... or she... is.
Two people are dead, and for all I know you could be the killer!
My goodness, two of us are now dead! What's going on in this place?
I've been trying to figure out who our host might be. With two people dead, it almost seems like he set this party up just to kill us all!
Gasp! Oh... oh, it's you. What do you want? Why are you looking at me that way?
Gasp! Oh... oh. I'm sorry. I... my nerves. I just want to get out of here. Three people have been murdered! I'm so very frightened!
Gasp! Oh, thank goodness it's you, sweetie! Please, don't wander too far away. I feel safe with you.
Aggh! They're dead! All dead! And you... you're the only one left. It's you! Oh, gracious, no! Stay away from me!
Aggh! They're dead! All of them, dead! Why? What's going on here? We need to get out of this place!
We've got to get out of here! You understand me? We're the only ones left! We need to find a way out of this house! Come on!
We're looking for recruits. Interested?
Well now, you are an ambitious one, aren't you? I'm afraid I have no more contracts for you. Our time working together has come to an end.
Instead, you must report to Ocheeva, here in the Sanctuary. She will be providing all your contracts from now on, and is waiting for you as we speak.
Before you go, however, I intend to make good on an offer I made some time ago. As a vampire, I may pass my gift on to others as I see fit.
You have served me well, and I choose now to extend that gift to you. Shall I use my dark powers and turn you into a vampire?
As I mentioned, I have no more contracts available. You'll need to speak with Ocheeva. Unless... you would like to discuss another matter?
As I mentioned, I have no more contracts available. You'll need to speak with Ocheeva.
As I mentioned, I have no more contracts available. You'll need to speak with Ocheeva. But first you should go and sleep! Your dark gift awaits...
Greetings... greetings fellow stalker of the damned! Enjoy your new gift. And don't forget to speak with Ocheeva! She has a contract waiting for you.
There's nothing more to say. They're all gone.
My poor Biene. Poor, sweet Biene. What monsters would do this? How can this have happened?
Hello, fellow Speaker. Welcome to the Black Hand. So nice to see you're in one piece.
What... What is that? Is that a... a head? No... No, it can't be... I.... Um... Sorry, Speaker... I'm... distracted....
Yeah? What're you lookin' at?
Any word from Jeanne in Bruma?
Speak with Jeanne Frasoric in Bruma, and see that she is all right.
The Council is in complete disarray at the news of Mannimarco's presence in Cyrodiil.
The King of Worms has obviously targeted the guild, but we have no idea why. No demands have been made.
All of my attention is devoted to the Council. We must discern the reason for this sudden attack, and stop Mannimarco before he destroys us all.
I am unable to look into something that has been brought to my attention. Are you capable of going on my behalf?
What news from Skingrad? I assume you've spoken to Count Hassildor.
You have your task. Return as soon as you have the information.
There is an urgent matter which requires your personal attention. This task falls to you, and only you.
Oh, you poor dear.
I'm afraid you're late to the party. The guest of honor has already left!
And I do hate to disappoint you, but Mucianus is in no condition to be leaving. He's a Worm Thrall now, and shall be quite content here.
A grim fate indeed, but one does not cross the Order of the Black Worm without suffering greatly for it.
I shall tell the master that you were here looking for him. Perhaps I'll bring him your head as an offering.
What news of your task? Your face looks grim.
Welcome back. An important task awaits you.
Greetings. It is high time that we meet face to face, don't you think?
Raminus has told me good things about you. You have advanced quickly, and show great promise.
I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test. I have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with.
What can I do for you, my friend?
Hello again! Have you had any luck finding the sword and armor?
Hello! You must be from the Fighters Guild. I'm glad you're here. I need your help to repay a debt.
Were you able to take care of my problem with break-ins?
What can I do for you? Do you have questions about these break-ins I've been having?
Greetings! Welcome to Lelles' Quality Merchandise. We have a wide range of goods to suit your needs.
Oh, and perhaps you saw the sign outside. Slight mistake, you know. Bit of bad luck there. So, what can I do for you?
Yes, honored Listener? Do you have orders for me?
I... I am returning to the Sanctuary, as quickly as I possibly can, oh great Listener!
It is an honor to speak with the living legend of the Dark Brotherhood! Your deeds are an inspiration to us all!
Well... Caranya will want to talk to you. You should go see her.
You'd better talk to Caranya before you do anything else.
If you're here to help, you'd best go see Caranya. She'll tell you what we need.
Are you here about the Amulet? If so, Caranya has it.
We've been hard at work. Caranya is very determined. You should go talk to her.
Have you recovered the Necromancer's Amulet?
Were you successful? Do you have the Black Soul Gem?
Go. Find Thalfin, and the other Battlemages. Stop the gem from reaching Mannimarco.
Time is against us, and our enemies grow stronger. There is much to do, and little time in which to do it. Your next task is essential.
A final task awaits you, when you are ready. It is time for you to strike back at the King of Worms.
I know what purpose this Soul Gem is meant to serve. It is meant to house my very own soul, to be absorbed by Mannimarco and increase his power.
You were sent to acquire this gem so Mannimarco would not get his hands on it. With it, he would have marched on the University and come for me.
There would have been little anyone could do to stop him. Now, however, I believe you have a chance to defeat him.
When you are ready, I have a final task for you to undertake. It will, undoubtedly, be the most important service you perform for the guild.
What do you want? I'll do anything you ask!
What business do you have with Meridia, Lady of Infinite Energies?
Bugs. Bugs! Everywhere. All over. Wonderful, tasty bugs. No time for you. Talk to Ravel. He doesn't like the bugs. Not even with mead.
Blessed are you. How may I serve you?
You have been set on a path. Follow it.
Yes? Why do you not approach the Shrine?
We are not afraid of the dark. The Night Mistress gives us eyes to see night's secrets.
You have failed Namira. Cursed forever are you.
Namira is pleased, foul one. May your days be filled with the hurtful stares of others. Dwell joyously in filth and squalor.
You have been given a task by Namira? Truly, you are terrible in my eyes. Disgusting and foul. Blessed are you.
You have been told to approach the shrine. Perhaps Namira will find favor in you.
Don't talk to me. Talk to the one in the robes.
Leave us, creature of light.
Don't go stirring up trouble.
Welcome to Pell's Gate. What brings you around here?
Welcome to Pell's Gate, friend.
So, you've managed to kill the Gatekeeper. Pity. Well, you'll now be able to enter the Realm proper. You'll notice there are two doors.
One leads to the lands of Mania. The other to Dementia. Enter through either one. The lands are quite distinct, but both are Sheogorath's domain.
You'll want to seek out Lord Sheogorath. I believe He has plans for you. Try not to disappoint Him.
Now is not really the time for conversation, is it? I feel like I'm interrupting something.
Perhaps when you've finished your slaughtering and washed the blood off your hands, we can chat again.
I wondered how long it would take before you needed my help. And here I am, at your service.
Really, sir, you'll need to start thinking for yourself. It is one of the basic requirements of godhood.
Really, ma'am, you'll need to start thinking for yourself. It is one of the basic requirements of godhood.
Let's be civil, shall we? Please, have a seat.
Well? Have you made up your mind? The tension is almost palpable.
Yes? Change of heart? Do tell.
More questions? Astounding. Speak.
Yes. What can I do for you? I imagine you're here about the door?
How can I make your life easier? It's what I live for.
I don't think I can render any assistance until you hear Lord Sheogorath out. Do pay close attention.
Does Your Grace wish to be crushed to death, or do you merely find difficulty in locating the buttons and switches in these old ruins?
It seems only fair to warn Your Grace that those who came before often placed switches far from the door itself.
For what purpose, we've never exactly been sure.
Uhm, Your Grace... now doesn't seem to be the best time for conversation. Perhaps your survival should take precedence at the moment.
Are you having trouble with the Obelisks, Your Grace?
It would seem that the Fringe has come under attack. The longer you wait to investigate, the harder it will be for you to do as you are told.
It would seem that the forces of Order have moved very quickly.
I will serve you well, Lord.
So, the cycle begins anew and the Dutchess of Dementia has fallen.
Just remember it was I that assisted you. I expect that will carry some favor under your rule.
What do you want now? I told you what I'm willing to do... now get away from me before someone hears us.
Ahhh, good to see you again.
Well done. I suppose you deserve your new post. Now, if only you stay alive long enough to enjoy it...
Well? What are you waiting for? You have the heart, and the altar awaits.
Ugh. How messy. Well, now that you possess Syl's Heart, I'd make my way to the Sacellum as soon as possible.
And do hurry, that heart is beginning to smell.
Do I have to spell it out for you? Apparently I do.
Syl has been slain. You need Syl's heart. I'll let you figure out the rest.
Now that you've found Syl's escape route I'd tread very carefully. She is the Mistress of Deception after all.
If she means to escape, she'll do everything in her power to stop you.
Kithlan seems eager to help you. When you become sovereign of Dementia, I'd keep him around.
So, you want to find the secret escape route? Easy enough.
I can't tell you exactly where it is. I wouldn't want your quest to be a "bust."
Clever adversary isn't she? I bet your thinking that this was too easy, yes?
Well, things aren't always as they seem. In fact, I think I hear the answer to your problem coming as we speak....
Confused already? Very disappointing.
If I were you, and thank Sheogorath that I'm not, I would begin with the people who spend their day closest to Syl.
Yes. You've gotten rather proficient with your new ability. As I said, try not to abuse your power.
Have we not covered this? I believe you've mastered your new skill.
I was right there. You could have just walked over to me.
I assume you're having fun?
Might we stop this now?
Surely, you have something better to do.
Well done. Summoned again. I applaud you.
What a surprise. I'm summoned. Your skill in repetition is truly astounding.
Clever. You've summoned me again. My Lord has made quite a choice for his champion.
That's enough. Really.
Ah, summoned again. My Lord does so enjoy that, as is His prerogative. I'll assume you're done for now.
Ah... our Lord has granted you the power to summon me. How wonderful for me.
When summoned, I can offer advice on your current endeavor. I imagine it's up to you what to do with my wisdom.
Do try to use your power sparingly. I have duties to which I must attend. Rather more important than shepherding you around, I'm sure.
While being summoned is truly a wonderful thing, and not at all tiresome, I believe Lord Sheogorath wishes you to speak with Him again.
I see you've returned. How exciting for you.
I believe you have some news for Lord Sheogorath. Perhaps you should be speaking with him instead of illuminating me with your presence.
I am sure Lord Sheogorath will be thrilled to hear whatever pressing matter you have to discuss with Him.
The Madgod has given you a task. Surely, someone of your copious talent should be able to handle it.
Ah...you're here. Joy. You'll want to speak to the Lord Sheogorath.
Thanks again for bringing Pyke back his Medallion! I've never seen him so full of happiness.
Did you bring back my aquanostrum?
I'm sorry to trouble you again...but I think the cure has worn off. I feel the cold grasp of death sneaking up on me once more.
Could you please get some more aquanostrum from Knotty Bramble for me?
What is it you require, my lord?
What is it you require, my lady?
Greetings, Magister. I trust you are serving the guild well.
What brings you here, Magister?
You gave those Maniacs something to think about, lighting the Torch for us. Well done!
What were you thinking, lighting the Great Torch for Mania? For shame.
Don't worry, my friend, this time we are on the same side! Umbacano wants us both to guide him through Nenalata.
You're the leader of this expedition. So lead on!
I see you've returned. Wonderful. Do you wish to return to your location at the time of the unfortunate...incident?
You've done it! Well done, Lord Sheogorath. I never doubted you for a moment.
Now, of course, there is business to attend to. As you have assumed the mantle of Sheogorath, there are matters that deserve your attention.
As lord of this Realm, there are a number of benefits to which you are entitled, as well as a number of duties to which you must attend.
Welcome, dear Sister! So good to finally meet you! I hope you're getting along all right. If you need anything, anything at all, you need only ask.
Hello, dearest Sister. Is there something I can help you with?
Welcome, brother. So good to finally meet you. I hope you're getting along all right.
Yes, dearest Brother? Is there something I can help you with?
Yes? Is there something you need?
Why do you insist on annoying me?
I... I ain't got nothing to say! Now leave me be!
You... You're not the one Lachance was talking about! Please... Please, don't kill me! You can take anything you like, then just leave!
Please, just take what you want and leave! I won't call the guards, I swear!
I ain't got nothin' to say to you, fancy pants. So why don't you mind your own business, huh?
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, take a copy! It's free!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Have you heard of the Blackwood Company? Read all about them!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have one of the latest editions, free as always!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Have the latest edition, free as always! It's about the Gray Fox!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have copies of the Black Horse Courier to deliver! Here's one of the latest! The Imperial Legion commander's been murdered!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have the latest edition! Some Elf in Bruma got killed!
Sorry, no time to talk! I have to deliver these copies of the Black Horse Courier! Here, have a copy! The Night Mother rituals are on the rise!
You need something... special? Check out my wares. You won't find this stuff at your local general store, that's for damn sure.
You have something to tell me about my father?
What's new?
Unless you relish the thought of decorating the end of my blade with your blood, I would get out of my sight.
Keep leading.
I don't like being disturbed.
Get out of my way before I have you slapped in irons.
Please, I'd like to be left alone.
There isn't much more to say. I'm sorry.
What news do you bring?
It's so very nice to see you again.
Here is the amulet back. It's as beautiful as it was the day I remember seeing it long ago. I want you to keep it, as I have no use for this anymore.
I'm certain that's what I want, and I'm certain that's what Bradon would want.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope that the amulet helps keep you safe on whatever roads you may travel.
Do you have any more questions? I'm afraid I know little more.
I can't believe this is happening.
Please... please. I need your help. My husband was no vampire! It's ridiculous! No one will listen to me!
I... I'm sorry... I can't right now.
As the newest member of the Knights of the Thorn, I bid you welcome!
You've given me new hope, friend. I really believe we can make Cropsford a home for ourselves.
What do you think, friend? We've accomplished a lot since you last saw this place.
I'm proud of what we've built here. You should be, too. Cropsford wouldn't exist without the help you gave us.
Hello my friend. A word of advice. Watch for goblins if you're heading north.
What brings you into this goblin-infested wilderness, stranger?
Welcome, traveller. We're all so worried about the goblins, we may not be as hospitable as we should be.
Let me know as soon as Cropsford is cleared of goblins, so we can get back to building our new settlement.
If it's about Cropsford, please talk to my father. He'll know what to do.
Have you spoken to S'drassa yet? I hear she eagerly awaits your return.
Anything else I can help with?
What can I help you with?
By the Divines, you've done it!
Finally! A new customer! Please... look around. Just promise me you won't buy from that fetcher, Thoronir.
If you have any questions about the merchandise, you've but to ask.
I've already heard the news! Well done!
I have everything for the budding alchemist under one roof. Far more than Thoronir would ever have, despite his horrid business ethics.
I have everything for the budding alchemist under one roof.
It's so good to see you again. I've spent a good deal of time speaking with Gilen and Grey-Throat. They agree that the Order should live on.
Not only that, but we'd like to make you an honorary member. If you're ever in need of our services, we'd be happy to provide them for you.
In addition, we'd like to reward you with this enchanted ring. Use it well in the fight.
Please, I've much to do. We'll speak again soon at the meeting place of the Order.
I hope you're here to bring me good news.
Memorial Cave, eh? Be very careful. That's obviously his true lair. There may be others with him.
Return here when you've made your discovery. You'll find that Seridur is the liar, not I.
Your trust is appreciated.
At least hear me out before you decide to end my life.
Go away! I know what you're here for! Just leave me alone!
Don't worry, pal, you'll get used to losing after a while.
I know when I'm beaten! Here, take the carving, if it means so much to you. I had no idea you would take things so personally.
Well done! You have much to learn about this business, my friend, but you show definite promise.
But first, of course: you must hand over the carving.
I won, you lost. There's nothing else to talk about right now.
You must be Umbacano's new plaything. Well met! I am Claude Maric, another pawn in Umbacano's game.
I always enjoy meeting my rival treasure hunters. What, did you think you were the only one? Ha ha ha! Come, let us have a drink together.
Come, I have much to tell you. A tavern is right over here. We will drink a toast to Umbacano.
Now then, I propose a toast. To Umbacano, may his purse never run dry!
Guilbert should be able to help you with anything you need... for now, I'm going to celebrate!
Thanks so much for getting us here safely!
I'm afraid we aren't very wealthy, but here is all I can offer you at this time. Please, visit us again soon.
The ogres certainly made a mess of this place. Hopefully, by the time you visit us again, we'll have it cleaned up!
What is it? Should we stop?
Is it safe to continue?
Are you ready to show us the way to Weatherleah yet?
Is it safe for us to return to Weatherleah yet?
Have you found Weatherleah? Is it safe for us to travel there?
I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with Reynald. I never would have guessed he was still alive.
We have much to discuss, but if you have time, I'd beg you stay a moment longer and hear about our home, Weatherleah.
I can't stop to talk now. I've got to go meet my brother!
Is there something I can do for you?
My good friend! Let me drink to your health! For saving my brother ... no, for finding him ... or was it for finding me? Anyway, bottoms up!
Would you look at this! My brother - my spitting image - is here! I can't thank you enough, friend.
Unfortunately, my hangover is making it difficult to think straight. You're best off speaking to Guilbert for now.
Ah, it's you! You're the one... err... who are you again?
Right, right. You were finding that fellow who's stolen my name. Have you had any luck?
Hello love. I'll have another bottle of wine if you please. And do hurry - the last 5 barmaids I've talked to never came back...
Wait... you don't work here, do you? But you do work for me. At least, you're supposed to be working for me. Off you go, then.
Ugh. You're about the ugliest barmaid I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a bit. Come to bring me another round, have you?
My mistake - shouldn't you be on the other side of Cyrodiil by now?
I swear I didn't know that was your pig. Eh? Oh. Sorry, I looked like someone else just then.
Or rather, you did. Yes, that's it. *hic* Aren't you doing a job for me? You should be off, then.
We've met before, haven't we?...  I don't... owe you money, do I?
Ah! No, I've got it. You're going to find the fellow trading on my name. Good show - carry on. *hic*
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, I've NEVER been to Cheydinhal! I.... oh, hang on. You're someone else.
Apologies, my good friend. I mistook you for someone else. Always being asked about it, I am. 'Didn't I see you in Cheydinhal?', they say.
Well I'm sick of it. Sick and tired, tired and sick. And perhaps a little drunk. But nevermind. You look like the honest sort, so I've a job for you.
You're going to travel to Cheydinhal, and find out what sort of imposter is trying to besmirch my good name. And you're going to tell him... *hic*
... You're going to tell him I am quite capable of besmirching my good name on my own. He should cease and desist immediately.
There's fifty gold pieces in it for you, friend... right then. Off you go.
Something's wrong... I can tell. What's happened to Aleron?
I'm hoping you bring me good news.
I'm afraid there isn't much else to tell you. Just be careful.
I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance, and I don't know what to do. My husband, Aleron, is missing.
You've killed all three? Wonderful! Now you must find the key. According to Kurdan, it should be on one of their bodies.
I don't trust Kurdan. Even if the hunters are beaten, make sure you watch your back.
I only wish to return home and be with my wife, Ursanne.
It appears as though Kurdan has tricked another poor soul with his "axe" story.
I knew one day someone with unyielding virtue would heed my words and speed my release. You risked much to perform such a selfless act.
This noble deed will not go unrewarded. Look upon the ground in this prison. There you will find a map to my gratitude.
I thank you with all my heart. Farewell.
I was once the man known as Grantham Blakeley. Look for me in the mouth of the panther. Please... release me.
Hush, child. This is serious.
Now's not the time, little one. The Count has been waiting for you.
Welcome, welcome!
I have something for you....
Now is not the time for talk. I have work to attend to.
Good to see you again. Do you have the Soul Gems I requested?
What brings you to this neck of the woods, my lady?
What brings you to this neck of the woods, sir?
You idiot! How could you kill Kurdan before you got Aleron to safety? Get... get out of my sight!
Please, I wish to be alone with my thoughts.
Please. I wish to be alone with my thoughts.
I've nothing to say to you.
You better hope I never get out of here.
Please, I no longer have a desire to speak with you. I appreciate what you've done in the past, but that's just what it is... the past.
It's a fine day is it not?
Please go away.
Our sister returns to the fold!
Our brother returns to the fold!
Any friend of the Society is a friend of mine. Have a look around.
Any friend of the Society is a friend of mine.
Hello again. You're more than welcome here! I have everything for the budding alchemist under one roof.
Hello again!
Kayleen's grave is outside if you wish to pay your respects.
It's nice to go back to tending sheep without having to look over my shoulder.
I'm looking forward to my retirement -- long days in the stable with the horses, long mornings in bed, and best of all: no more fish.
What news do you bring me from Exhausted Mine?
Please... I implore you, help me avenge my wife's death!
You know, stranger, there comes a time in every man's life when he has to admit that he's lost the fight. Well, I've fought and I've lost.
Who did I lose to? Who is my great enemy? Well, don't laugh... it's a bunch of damn fish.
I don't know what I'll do if you don't get those scales for me. I've saved so much for my retirement, but it's just not enough...
Come back to laugh at the pathetic old man, have we? To the pit with you! Leave me alone.
Eh? You again? You ready to hear about an old man's troubles?
I don't know where those bears came from, or why they picked my place to attack, but you must drive them away.
I wish I could be more hospitable, but I'm a bit distracted. It seems I'm having a bear problem and I just don't know what to do.
You aren't brooding on that little unpleasantness at Malada, are you?
You won the last round. I salute your bold spirit!
And so we meet again. What can I do for you this time?
If you could help Pyke, I think you'd make him very happy.
I've grown quite fond of him and can't stand seeing him this way.
I'm still working up the nerve to paint his portrait, but I'd rather do it when he's back to his happier self.
I hope you have something for me.
Hello again... talk to me while you can. I don't think I've got too long.
Sickly Bernice, proprietor. Don't get too close now. You might catch what I have.
Hello... don't mind me... I'm a little tired. Can't sleep at home, you know. The walls. They aren't safe.
Have you found me a safe place outside to sleep yet?
Hurry, before everything falls on top of us!
Yes? Is there something you require?
So much to do. So little time left to do it.
This is the Bay Roan stables. Are you interested in a horse?
This is the Bay Roan stables.
We don't have any horses for sale right now. You bought our last Bay horse.
This is one of our best Bay horses. Take good care of him.
If you are looking to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Isabeau.
Is this pleasure or business?
You wear the shadows well, fellow thief.
When I saw the fiery clouds and the daedra in the streets, I was sure we were all dead... but you saved us.
You sure gave those damned daedra what for! It makes us all feel better to have someone like you around.
I'm Norbert Lelles. I let my merchandise speak for itself. Look around. If you see something you like, we'll talk about a price.
Marc Gulitte, Mages Guild Evoker, Advanced Instructor in the Arts of Destruction.
I'm Mirabelle Monet. I run the Fo'c's'le, a boarding house for sailors. Sorry. I reserve my beds for seamen.
Timothee LaRouche, late of the Black Dog, able seaman. I'll be staying ashore 'til my stash runs out, then it's off to sea once more.
Didier Aumilie, ship's clerk. At present, I'm spending my time and gold on the pleasures of the Gold Coast.
I bet you hear this all the time, but thanks for closing that Oblivion Gate! We were all so worried.
Welcome to Weynon Priory, a monastic retreat dedicated to Talos and the Nine Divines.
I'm Prior Maborel, head of our community, and responsible for all our religious and secular affairs.
My name is Eugal Belette. I'm pretty new here -- don't know a soul.
I am Alberic Litte of the Mages Guild. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.
Well, hello there. Sabine Laul, guild smith -- real happy to meet you. So. What can I do for you?
Welcome to Renoit's Books. I'm the owner, Estelle Renoit. Look around. If you don't see what you want, please ask.
Certainly. What do you need?
Thank you for closing the Oblivion Gate. We all took heart when we heard the news.
Your bravery is the talk of Skingrad. Well done!
Hello. We haven't met, have we? I'm Sister Marie Palielle, the chapel healer, and trainer in the Restoration Arts.
I'm in charge here. Adrienne Berene. Do you have Mages Guild business?
You have obviously made a mistake. Sir Lazare Milvan would never speak with someone of your low birth.
You are obviously of low birth. Unless you dispute my judgement... and you would press your suit at the end of a sword.
You are talking again. You will stop.
I am Ambroise Canne, grape-grower for Surilie Brothers. I'm also an advanced trainer for weapon and shield parries.
I'm Bernadette Peneles. I work for Tamika. I grow grapes. For her wines.
I'm Davide, of Surilie Brothers Vineyard. Gaston is my brother. From our vineyards come the finest wines in Tamriel.
I'm Gaston Surilie. Perhaps you've met my brother, Davide? Together, we are the Surilie Brothers Winery.
Hannibal Traven, Arch-Mage of the Mages Guild. Welcome to the Arcane University.
Julienne Fanis. I'm the Alchemy Expert. At least, the best the Mages Guild has.
Master Spellmaker Gaspar Stegine, at your service. New spells. Old spells. Good spells. Bad spells. They're all fun for me.
Renald Viernis. I'm the Practice Room Proctor. No horseplay or foolishness. This is for serious exercises.
Welcome to 'The Main Ingredient'. Ogier Georick. If you're an alchemist, then you've come to the right place.
Edgar Vautrine. You don't want the very best. You want cheap. And I got cheap.
The Gilded Carafe, for all your alchemical needs. Claudette Perrick, service with a smile.
I'm Irene Metrick. If you needed to know more, you'd already know.
I'm Roderic Pierrane.
I'm Elisa Pierrane. Father bought us this lovely house in the City.
Kastus Sintav. Uncle Iniel got us good jobs gardening. We're very grateful.
I'm Beran. Kastus, Vontan, and me, we take care of gardens and trees and grass. Hard work, but it pays.
Samuel Bantien. You want to learn a few tricks about Security, I'm your man.
Rochelle Bantien. Samuel's wife. I'm glad he's settled down to training and the quiet life.
Welcome to the Foaming Flask. Good food, good drink. I'm Ernest Manis. Let me know what you need.
Jakben, Earl of Imbel. We do not know one another. And, given your modest social standing, I doubt we ever shall.
My name is Hastrel Ottus, and I'd like to talk about Akatosh.
I don't know you. Just stay away from me.
Salomon Geonette. I'm a musician. I had a commission from the Emperor to compose a symphony...
... But now, with the emperor dead, everything is at sixes and sevens.
My name is Ancus Afranius. I do whatever comes to hand. Or nothing, when I can afford it.
I'm the warehouse watchman, Damian Magius.
We all owe you our lives. From what I've heard, the battle was hanging in the balance until you destroyed that horrible daedric machine.
Hey, you're the one that helped Captain Burd destroy that damned Oblivion Gate! Well done, friend, well done!
I'm Yvara Channitte, Countess Bruma's steward. The Countess makes policy, leaving the details of administration to me.
I'm Gan Luseph, Castle Mage and Healer.
Actually, I'm not much of a healer. I can blow the meat off you, but I'm not much good at sticking it back on.
It was you that closed that Oblivion Gate, wasn't it? That was a brave thing to do!
Welcome, my friend! I am Isabeau Bienne, the ostler of Bay Roan Stables. And today I can sell you such a very fine bay horse!
Antoine Branck. I just work here. If you want a horse, go inside and talk to Isabeau.
I am Mara's Primate, Chana Mona. I  take care of the Chapel's affairs in Bravil Parish, and speak for Mara in the Council of the Nine.
Delphine Jend. Creator of the celebrated 'Enemies Explode' spell. Advanced Trainer in Destruction. And Mage Destined for Great Things.
Hello, stranger. Luciana Galena. I'm Bravil's Advanced Trainer for the Light Armor discipline.
Hello. I'm Roxanne Brigette. I help the boys. They get a little squirrelly sometimes, find it hard to cope. So I help out.
The Count always says that Leyawiin stands alone, but your actions proved him wrong. Well done.
I'm Phebe Jeanard, a charity sister of Gottlesfont Priory. Are you looking for alchemical ingredients?
Sickly Bernice, proprietor. Talk to me while you can. I don't think I've got too long.
You again. Guess you're not afraid of catching it.
I'm Anya Herrick. I serve Lady Syl, and she allows me to remain protected within the House of Dementia. I'm so grateful to her.
Here we are, safe indoors. Nothing to harm us here, is there?
I'm Amiable Fanriene. Sorry, can't talk. Got to move on.
It's not safe here. The walls are about to collapse. You'd best get moving, friend!
No time to chat. The ceiling looks like it's about to buckle. Got to move.
Sorry, friend. It's not safe here. Can't talk now. Got to move. Carefully. Don't want to bring the place down on our heads!
Zoe Malene's the name. Sorry I don't have much time to have a formal introduction, but I must get my latest painting finished!
Not that it matters, really. I'm sure I'll lose my inspiration halfway through.
I don't have time for this; I must get back to my next catastrophic waste of time.
My Lord! What can I do for you?
Perhaps my Lord will fortify the walls?
Lord Sheogorath, your presence alone makes me feel more healthy.
Hello, I'm Nanette Don. I wasn't sure why I came here, until she showed up. Now I know. I'm going to be a powerful sorceress. Just like Relmyna!
Do you hear that sound? It's like a horse dying...
Hello! You'll need to speak up.
Hello, is there something I can do for you?
What are you doing in here. This is the headquarters for the Knights of the Thorn. No one else is allowed inside.
If you stay here, and Lord Farwil finds out when he gets back from his latest quest, he will have me thrown out of here. Please, leave at once.
It's the Chapel of Akatosh. Four walls standing, and no fire. Can you think of a safer place?
Shh. The Master is speaking!
I am Harrow, Warden of the Shrine of Dagon.
By following the Path of Dawn hidden in the writings of the Master, Mankar Camoran, you have earned a place among the Chosen.
You have arrived at an opportune time. You may have the honor to be initiated into the Order by the Master himself.
As a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn, everything you need will be provided for you from the Master's bounty.
Give me your possessions, and put on this initiate's robe.
Come. Your initiation awaits.
You may not leave here until your initiation is complete. Lord Dagon thirsts for red-drink. Sate him.
Welcome, brother. You are one of the Chosen now.
Welcome, sister. You are one of the Chosen now.
Is there something you require?
Your blood will satisfy Lord Dagon just as well as the prisoner's. It will be our honor to spill your blood for Him, if you choose that path.
Slay the sacrifice. Lord Dagon thirsts for blood.
How can I serve you, brother?
How can I serve you, sister?
Help! You must help! They're killing everyone at Weynon Priory!
Are they gone? Is it safe to come back?
Oh, hey there! Nice to make your acquaintance. I'm... Well, my name's not important, really. I'm a combatant in the Arena. Gladiator rank.
Hey, there, Pit Dog! How's life treatin' ya?
Good to see you, Brawler. Your training's going well, I hope?
You're at Bloodletter rank now, right? I caught your last match. Those were some pretty impressive moves!
Myrmidon! Good to see you!
I've been watching you fight, my friend. It's a good thing we're both on the Blue Team, 'cause I sure as blazes wouldn't want to go up against you!
You did it! You made it to Gladiator rank, same as me! Here's to a long, successful career, my friend!
I saw your match against the Breton. You're a Hero now! I... I'm still in training, but I'll get there too! Anyway, Congratulations!
By Shinji, you did it! You beat them all! You're a Champion! My friend, you have brought honor to the Blue Team in ways I can't even describe!
You... You killed Agronak. The Gray Prince is... dead. He... He was my friend, my mentor... Congratulations, Grand Champion. Hope it was worth it.
You like my amulet? It's enchanted, makes me lucky! I swear it helps me win these matches!
It's all about the Yellow Team! Go Yellow Team! Yeah! Woo! Wait, you didn't bet on the Blue Team, did you? 'Cause that would just be plain stupid!
Hmm? Yes, yes, I'm sure you've got something exceedingly important to say. But the Apprentices do not teach themselves, now do they? Good day.
Why do the guards insist on letting you rabble inside University grounds? Take your pedestrian gawkery to the Arena! Begone!
Shall we start the ceremony?
You've made your selection. Now, we travel to the statue of our Lord, in the Fringe. There we will perform the ceremony. Make haste!
I shall meet you in the Fringe, near the bust of Sheogorath. Now go! Make haste.
Is it that difficult? Fetch one of each. Hurry up!
Sheogorath's Duchess or not, you try my patience! Are you confused about your task?
Sheogorath's Duke or not, you try my patience! Are you confused about your task?
You have returned with all the components? Excellent. All that remains is to choose the body parts.
You! I remember you. You're the adventurer who slew my Gatekeeper, are you not?
Hello! It's always a pleasure to speak with you.
I'm only talking to you out of loyalty to Sheogorath. Otherwise I'd cut you open and pull all your insides out.
Yes? What do you want? Out with it!
Excuse me. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with.
You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing.
Thank you, thank you! I can't tell you how good it feels to be able to see myself again.
My sisters, on the other hand ... I wouldn't mind if they had stayed invisible! Ha ha ha!
Ah, me... Friend, you are welcome at the Aleswell Inn anytime. Free of charge.
What? Ancotar gave you TWO scrolls and you wasted them both?!
We trusted you to help, and you betrayed us! It would be best if you left this town and never came back.
Have you talked to Ancotar yet? Can he make us visible again?
Oh, really? I'm invisible, you say? Thanks for letting me know. Talk to my brother Diram if you want to know all about it.
Sometimes, people who are invisible are trying to get some privacy. Diram will be glad to talk your ear off about the whole mess.
Useless Fighters Guild. What do you want?
Thank you for all your help. My rats appreciate it.
Get inside. The Gray Fox is not a patient man.
The Imperial Watch has imposed a curfew. We have to remain in our homes until they catch the Gray Fox.
Wait, I know you... You... You're the one! That day the Emperor was killed! They went through your cell! You lucky bastard! But... You came back?
Come on, you've got to help me! Let old Valen out of this cell! You've got your freedom, now give me mine! What do you say, huh? Come on, friend!
Wait, I know you... You... You're the one! That day the Emperor was killed! They went through your cell! You lucky strumpet! But... You came back?
You dare torment me? Valen Dreth? Let me out of this cell, you fetid piece of Guar dung!
Oh, can it really be true? Can the killer really be dead? This has been such a nightmare! I just want to find a way out of this house and go home.
Hello, I'm Dovesi. I'm very pleased to meet you. Now that you're here, we can really start looking for that chest of gold.
What I mean to say is, before you arrived, we all just sort of glanced around a bit. Now that we're all officially here, we can look in earnest!
It's funny. I don't even know you, and already I don't like you.
This is all so strange, isn't it? I don't know why I was invited to come here, but the gold could really help my family. I do hope I find it.
You seem like a very nice person. I very much want to find the gold, but I wish you luck. May the best guest win. He he.
I'm sorry, but I don't feel much like talking right now. Someone has been killed! Don't you even care?
I... I can't believe it's true. One of us is dead... and everyone else is convinced it was no accident.
Why? Why would someone do this? The taking of a life is against every principal I hold dear. It's something I just can't understand.
Two people dead, and you're still alive. I'm sorry, but you're starting to make me nervous. Please go away.
Two of us, dead! Who would do this? And why? Is that why we're all here? To be killed like vermin? I feel like I'm going mad!
I don't care about the gold anymore. I just want to get out of here. I'm going to try all the windows and doors, and see if I can't get one open!
No.... no! You... you stay away from me! One of you is the killer... stay away from me!
Only three of us left... only three...
Only three of us left. I'm certainly no murderer, and I know it's not you. That leaves one person! We must protect ourselves... find weapons!
You... you're the only one left... By Azura, no! Please, please don't kill me. I beg of you! Spare my life! Aggghhh!
Please. Please help me. I don't want to die. I just want to go home. Go home...
We must escape! Do you understand? We're the only two left! We're next! If we don't find a way out of here, we're going to die!
You're not afraid of trouble, are you? You'd like the Fighters Guild.
Why are you talking to me? Shouldn't you be finding Maglir?
What do you want? I suppose you've come looking for duties, huh?
I'm looking for results from you. What have you found out?
Back again, huh? What is it?
Hello, friend! What can I do for you?
His ring. Have you pried it from the coward's corpse?
Azani Blackheart is dead, and our brothers avenged.
We don't have time to talk. I want to find Blackheart. What do you need?
He's here somewhere. I know it.
Nothing! I knew it! Azani Blackheart isn't here, alive or dead.
Let's look around.
Let's get moving. Head to Arpenia.
Meet me at the Fighters Guild in Leyawiin. We've got work to do.
We need to check out Arpenia. Come on. I'll follow you.
Have you changed your mind about helping me?
I need your help now. Have you made up your mind?
Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to.
I said we'd speak later. What do you need?
Ah, it's you. I figured you'd be by soon.
What is it? Shouldn't you be taking care of Maglir's contract?
Yes? I assume you've spoken to that lout Maglir?
What is it? You're supposed to find Maglir.
You again. Fine. I imagine you're looking for work from me.
You're back. What have you found out about Galtus Previa's disappearance?
You and Viranus have business to attend to. Why are you wasting time here?
What is it? You've got duties to attend to.
I figured you'd be back for more work. Good. There's more to be done.
What have we here? Another plaything?
You'll dance for me, little one, yes, you will. I'll make your corpse dance, and then tear itself apart!
You're back. What have you found out?
Why are you here talking to me? I need you to go investigate the Forsaken Mine. And now!
You're back. Good. You have important duties to attend to.
My rats are all dead! It's too late to do any more. I won't be needing your services any longer.
So, did you follow her? She's behind it, isn't she? Tell me what you found out!
Thank the gods you killed that thing. This is ridiculous! Someone's out to get me, to get my poor babies! I'll bet it's that Quill-Weave next door.
Don't just stand there! Go get that mountain lion!
You've got to take care of those mountain lions!
You should be looking for Pinarus! What are you doing here?
Well, what have you found? Did you take care of my babies? What was going on down there?
Aren't you going to take care of this? What am I paying you for?
Ah... you must be from the Fighters Guild. Good. I have a problem. It has to do with the rats in my basement.
Did you speak with Vilena? How did she react?
Have you done it? Have you destroyed that foul tree?
You've started the job; now you must finish it. You need to get back to Leyawiin. How can I help?
I need you in Leyawiin to take care of that Hist. What is it you need?
It is time for decisive action. I have one more duty for you to perform.
Well, what did you find at Water's Edge?
I want you to get back to Water's Edge. Make sure the Blackwood Company hasn't forced those residents out.
Good. You're finally awake. I was beginning to get a bit concerned about you.
I don't want to talk to you, traitor.
I need you to get down to Leyawiin and infiltrate the Blackwood Company.
Since you managed to make a mess of the interrogation, we've got extra work to do if we're going to stop the Blackwood Company.
We've got some work to do if we're going to stop the Blackwood Company.
Damn. Killed himself. Must have had some sort of magic item we didn't notice.
Work on him until he talks. Try not to kill him.
You've got him. Let's talk about Ajum-Kajin.
What is it? I need you to go get Ajum-Kajin.
Haven't written me off yet, huh? Good. If you're willing, there's more work to be done.
Our troubles are almost at an end, Brother. Soon we will visit the Night Mother, and she will surely guide us.
Our troubles are almost at an end, Sister. Soon we will visit the Night Mother, and she will surely guide us.
So, at last we meet. I have been following your strange journey through the Dark Brotherhood, young one.
Your killing of the old man Baenlin... the execution of Adamus Phillida... the way you stalked and murdered each member of the Draconis family...
Your Purification of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. You, a mere underling, even managed to single-handedly eliminate half of my Black Hand!
You've returned. I trust you've weighed the importance of your new position. For you will soon hear words that will change lives, alter destinies.
And I hope you've taken everything you desire from my crypt. Once you leave, you will be unable to return. Now, are you ready to begin your new life?
No time to talk. Go away.
Thank you for your help. You are always welcome here.
Please, see if you can't find our friends who have disappeared.
Hello. You're from the Fighters Guild, I presume. It's good that you've arrived. We need your help with some disappearances.
You would dare to approach the King of Worms?
If you seek an audience with His Grace, you must open this door. I hold the key, and I will die defending it.
This place is sacred. Please respect our privacy.
You have entered a holy place. What is your business here?
Your business with Vaermina is complete. Tremble should she visit you in your dreams.
Vaermina has spoken to you. Surely you are blessed.
Who are you, who dares to walk in the House of Shadow? What business do you have with the Lord Vaermina?
You've pleased the Madgod! You must be proud of yourself. I, for one, still would like to eat your eyes. But, good for you!
You've spoken to the Madgod. Joy of joys! Are you elated? Excited? Aroused? Blessed are you. Blessed is He!
You've been told what Sheogorath wants. The rest is up to you.
Place. Not place? Here. Not here? Welcome to the Grove of Madness, stranger. Or go away. Who knows? Time will tell.
You are no longer welcome here.
You have pleased Molag Bal. Blessed is the one who spreads the seeds of dissent.
The Lord Bal has given you a task. Perform it well.
You have been told the way to reach Molag Bal. Do what you will.
Fools must be separated from their illusions before they will come to Him.
Some mischief of yours in Bleaker's Way has interfered with Mephala's plans. You're wasting your time here.
Your failure angers Mephala. Leave here.
Greetings, favored of the Webspinner, Champion of Mephala.
Our Lady has given you a task. The blessings of the Webspinner be upon you.
You approach the Shrine of Mephala. The Webspinner watches you, stranger.
That's the last time you'll commit a crime in Bleaker's Way!
The Ulfgars are all dead. Whatever possessed them to attack us like that?
Damn the Ulfgar! They'll pay!
What is it? There is trouble here in Bleaker's Way.
Hail, traveler. You are welcome in Bleaker's Way.
Please! I've got to get to work! All we have left is the farm!
Please! I've got to get to work. If I don't... who knows what those ogres will do to me!
You've murdered the poor beasts! And ruined us! Leave us alone!
Now my poor husband is the slave, and the ogres are his masters. They haven't harmed us, but he's never worked so hard in his life.
I'm afraid you've upset my husband. Please, leave before he loses his temper. I beg you.
Greetings, traveller. What is your business here?
I have no more to say to you. Leave.
I welcome you to my humble home, stranger. What brings you to this place?
No repeat offenders! That's my motto!
Thieves break in, but they don't break out... they break all over, when I'm finished with them.
You're living on borrowed time, thief!
Blessed are you, who walks his true path. Enlightened are you, who learns of himself.
If you have followed the path before you, speak with our Lord.
The Lord Hermaeus has set you on a new path. Follow it and return to him.
The fate of man drifts like seaweed in the net of His mind.
This location is supposed to be secret. Not secret enough, obviously....
If you think I'm interested in whatever you're selling, you're wrong. I'm not. Why don't you go play with the Gatekeeper? Run along now.
You've killed my child! How dare you! Get out of my sight!
I'm too upset to talk right now.
Well, what have we here? Another hopeful whose blessing hasn't fully taken root?
No, I don't think so. You're an adventurer?  How disgusting. Why don't you go back the way you came?
I'm not sure I can make this much clearer...
Stop wagging that tongue at me, or I will rip it out!
Stay away! You don't know! You can't know! It's in there! It'll kill us all!
She has darkened... what will we do now?
Greetings, friend. Have you come seeking the light?
Greetings, sister. How does the light find you this day?
May the light shine upon your face!
Greetings, brother. How does the light find you this day?
That was quite a battle. I hope you are uninjured.
Good luck to you!
As is the tradition, you are to be awarded a focus crystal as a token of your fine work.
I'll have it sent to the palace and placed in the main hall, if you wish to take a look at it.
Please, meet me in the reception chamber.
You've made short work of the intruders. Sheogorath should be proud to have such an efficient apprentice.
Now, if you'll step on the last teleporter pad, I will meet you in the reception chamber so we can recover your earnings.
I see Lord Sheogorath chose wisely when he selected you to liberate Xedilian.
Now, how may I continue to assist you?
What can I assist you with?
Finally, Lord Sheogorath has sent someone to assist me!
But where are my manners? Ahem... must get into my professional tone... ahem...
Welcome to Xedilian, I'm the dungeon caretaker, Kiliban Nyrandil.
You've certainly done your part protecting Xedilian. Should Sheogorath ever decide to visit, I'll be sure to inform him of your proficiency.
Take this. It's from a friend.
I don't have time to talk.
Order will rule this realm. It is foreordained.
I prepare the way for my Lord Jyggalag.
Beautiful, isn't she? The Marie Elena. Damn fine ship, with a damn fine crew. I should know, I'm her first mate. Malvulis is my name.
So believe me when I tell you we don't like it when people snoop around in our affairs. You get near that ship, and my men will run you through.
I hope I made myself clear the first time. If you get near that ship, you'll end up dead. Now get out of my face.
I have no time for your pathetic attempts at small talk. Now walk away, before I get... nasty.
No! You filthy guttersnipe! You won't get away with this! By Sithis, if I could only move my arms, I'd rip that smile right off your face!
Our business is done.
You've made your choice... now leave me be.
So... what have you brought me?
Look, I told you everything you need to know. Go to the cave, kill the ogres, get a reward. How hard is that?
I may have a bit of a proposition for you involving the Jemane family you so recently assisted.
Get outta my way, and keep followin'. I'll show ya a thing or two...
Who're you...?
Who... wha... are you... time is it? Hic.
Seems you've made your choice. I suppose we'll have to do it your way. I don't know what else to say.
I have no regrets.
Stand back, and let me take care of this.
Well, where is he?
What's wrong?
I appreciate the interest you're taking in helping us with our situation.
You seem far too nice to be one of Ulrich's men. What can I do for you?
Congratulations. I had a feeling you would catch on sooner or later. Leaving that journal behind was a stupid mistake on my part.
I saw you enter Olav's Tap and Tack before I could get there, and I knew that I had to sneak out of Bruma somehow.
It was only a matter of time before you or Carius figured it out. No matter. After I've killed you, I won't need my vampire hunter ruse any longer.
Ho there! Where do you think you're going! Selene's not going to like this one bit... I wasn't to be disturbed!
You should speak to Seridur first. He has your reward.
Please forgive my ignorance. Had we known about Seridur, we'd never have put you in harm's way.
My knowledge is at your disposal.
You must speak with Seridur first.
Nice to see you again. Is there something you require?
I really can't help you with anything else. Please, go see Gilen at Seridur's house.
You've come back! Have you reconsidered?
Pardon me. I'm sorry to trouble you, but I was sent to ask for your help.
I didn't know Seridur was a vampire. I swear!
I serve Roland now. Please, accept my apologies for my error in judgement.
Seridur is asleep right now. He's had a long night of study, and is exhausted. Do not disturb him. He'll be up at five this evening.
I'm Cylben Dolovas, assistant and bodyguard to Seridur. Let's leave it at that.
I don't know how to thank you. You have a good heart to help get me back home. I'll never forget what you've done for me.
Here, please take this apron as a token of our friendship. It's not much, but perhaps it will help you in the future.
All I ask in return is to keep the Brush's existence secret. If word gets around that I have it, I'm afraid more than a lone cutpurse will visit me.
No time to talk. Let's go home.
Good work! Now I can paint the portal home. After it's complete, you must go first or else you'd be stuck in here forever.
We need the Brush to get out of here. Bring it to me so we can get out of this painting. Hurry, I'm starving.
Excellent work my friend! All we need is the Brush, and we can leave this place.
Where did you come from? You look real enough. You must be from the outside! Oh, thank goodness someone finally came!
While I'm overjoyed to see a friendly face, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
You're stuck here like I am.
Sorry to break it to you like that, but if it wasn't for that annoying thief, we wouldn't be in this predicament.
Oh! I don't know how to thank you! You've brought my husband back to me. I shall always count you as a friend.
I must speak to my husband first!
I don't see Rythe with you. I hope you're not here to give me bad news.
May I answer any questions for you?
Have you changed your mind? I miss my husband, and fear the worst.
I'm Tivela Lythandas. I apologize that I can't give you the respect a guest in my home would normally receive, but I am at my wit's end.
I am sorry to be so forward, but I desperately need your help. It seems that my husband, Rythe, has gone missing, and I just don't know what to do.
I'm pleased to finally meet the savior of Cheydinhal. And although the death of Farwil saddens me, I know you did the best you could.
I realize he was trying at times, and he spoke before he thought, but he was still my son, and I adored him greatly.
I'm sure he was difficult to travel with, and I respect your patience. Whereas others would have left him to die, I'm sure you fought at his side.
Your actions are duly noted, and your reward will be in gold.
I'm pleased to finally meet the savior of Cheydinhal. I'm also overjoyed that you saved my son's life.
I realize he's trying at times, and he speaks before he thinks, but he's still my son, and I adore him greatly.
I'm sure he was difficult to travel with, and I respect your patience. Most would have given him up for dead rather than deal with his ego.
Anyway, I digress. I'm sure you wish to hear of your reward.
I'm in possession of two fine weapons. They're both heirlooms of the Indarys family, held in the Castle for several generations.
I'd take great pleasure in bestowing one of them upon you. Please, choose the Thornblade or the Staff of Indarys.
Please. Although I'm concerned about the safe return of my son and the closing of the gate, please see Amminus Gregori for all of the details.
With a possible attack looming, I must be free to make preparations. Good luck.
I don't have time to chat right now. With that Oblivion Gate looming outside the city walls, we're bracing for an attack. Perhaps we can speak later.
Why are you still here? You're supposed to go speak with my father!
We made it!... errr, I mean... victory is ours once again! Huzzah! It's a shame that Bremman didn't make it though. He was a good knight.
You've done well. I wouldn't have expected such bravery from someone who isn't a Knight of the Thorn.
Now that this battle between good and evil has been won, and the day is ours, you should go speak with my father.
He will reward you greatly for escorting me home and closing the Oblivion Gate.
Since you have led us to victory, I am hereby giving you the honorary title of a Knight of the Thorn.
Your name shall be revered and your deeds placed into song to be performed by the greatest bards for generations to come. Congratulations!
We made it!... errr, I mean... victory is ours once again! Huzzah!
Lead on... to victory for the Knights of the Thorn! Oh, and you too of course.
It's about time someone got here. What took you so long?
You are a person of your word. You must hasten to Rosentia and tell her at once!
Back for more information?
Poor Rosentia, she's been trapped in her house for days.
I'm not much for small talk. Just leave me out of it.
Wha'? You sellin' something? Go away, I'm broke!
I'm really not interested in speaking to you right now.
I'm overjoyed to hear that Garrus has replaced Ulrich as the Captain of the Guard. I'm sure he'll do a fine job.
You have some nerve addressing me after slaying my son. You're lucky I didn't have you executed on the spot! Now get out of my sight!
I'm sorry, although I wish to spend time speaking with you, I have much business to attend to. Please be brief.
I'm pleased that a Knight of the Thorn has received such a worthy gift. Even if you're just an honorary knight.
My house is yours, friend. Please, come back to visit us anytime.
Please leave. I have no wish to speak with you any longer.
Please, share the hospitality of our home.
How can I help?
On behalf of the entire town, I thank you for ridding Rosentia of the scamps.
Looking for anything to purchase today?
Ah, I'm sure you've come to pay homage to the greatest fighting force to grace the lands of Cyrodiil!
What can Lord Farwil do for you?
Ah, the savior of Aleswell! Whatever you need, I'm at your service.
I told you not to come back here, and I meant it.
Oh, it's you. My brother goes on and on about you. I know you saved us and everything, but it does get tiresome after a while.
You better stay away from Diram. He's not very happy with you.
You really enjoy this whole hero thing, don't you? Everybody fawning all over you? I'm not like that.
It's almost worth staying invisible forever, just to see how much it annoys Diram. But that doesn't make me like you any better.
Power! I need power! Unless you can give me the magicka to help these soldiers, get out of my way.
The citizens are in my way. Should I kill them? No? Too bad. If only I had more magicka. I could kill the Fanatics and then rule this town!
They doubted my power. Now they'll see!
What are you doing here? What do you want?
Begone, stranger! I have business with Kynareth's shrine, and I will not be disturbed.
Go away, stranger. You frighten the animals, and make my work more difficult.
Not now. My spell will wear off my new pet any minute now.
I really must thank you. Chapters 23 and 48 of my taxonomy are now complete thanks to your effort. Please, take this as a token of my gratitude.
You've caught me a Baliwog! I can't wait to study it. Let's go inside and I'll pay you.
An Elytra! They're tricky. I'll make sure to magically bind this one to me. Let's go to the house to get your reward.
A Gnarl! You've earned your reward. Follow me.
Hmm. This Scalon looks a bit mangy, but I suppose it will do. Your reward is in the house.
This is a wonderful start for my new bestiary. Well worth the price. Here you go.
I'm very excited to have an Elytra. Here's your pay.
Here you go, bounty hunter. I can't wait to begin playing with my living tree.
You have proven to be quite the hunter. Take your bounty. You've earned it.
My collection is complete. Thankfully, you won't be interrupting me anymore.
I don't care if you are Lord Sheogorath, I hate being interrupted in my work. I assume this is important?
I hate these interruptions, but I suppose they are unavoidable.
Yes? Well, out with it!
Something you need? So many things to need.
I run the North Country Stables. Are you interested in a horse?
I run the North Country Stables.
I don't have any horses for sale right now. You bought our last Chestnut horse.
You bought an execellent Chestnut horse. Take care of him.
If you are looking to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Bongond.
I own the Black Waterside Stables. Are you shopping for a horse?
I own the Black Waterside Stables.
I don't have any horses for sale right now. You bought our last Black horse.
The Cheydinhal Black horse is the finest in Cyrodiil. Take good care of him.
If you want to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Tovas.
Ah, yes. A guild brother in search of a fence?
What was it like, in the Temple, at the end? Did Martin really call down the power of Akatosh to smite Dagon?
Going into that Oblivion Gate was an impressive feat of derring-do. I salute you!
Varel Morvayn. Been making weapons and arms here in Anvil for 30 years. People say I do good work, and I don't aim to argue with them.
Llensi Llaram. Fighters Guild, through and through.
I'm Felen Relas of the Mages Guild. I handle Alchemy training for the Anvil chapter.
I'm Arvena Thelas. They call me 'the rat lady', on account of all my pet rats.
It's good to have a bit of good news in these dark times. What can I do for you, Hero of Chorrol?
I'm Glistel. What do you need?
I'm the Fighters Guild Champion, Modryn Oreyn. I don't believe we've met.
I'm the chapel healer, Gureryne Selvilo. We're glad to see you paying your respects here at the chapel.
I'm the shepherd here. Eronor's the name. And this is Weynon Priory.
Cheydinhal is in your debt, friend. That Oblivion Gate had us all living in fear.
Welcome to Black Waterside Stables. Finest horses in all Cyrodiil. And I'm speaking literally. I'm Tovas Selvan, the owner.
Well, yes, my name.... Mivryna Arano. Excuse me, but I don't speak much. With people, that is.
Welcome to Newlands Lodge, the best place to drink in Cheydinhal. Not counting the Chapel... haha. I'm Dervera Romalen.
This is a Dark Elf bar. Cursing, spitting, and screaming? No problem.
Fighting is fine with me, too, only the Guard objects, and they'll fine you or lock you up. Not my call.
I am Andel Indarys, Count Cheydinhal. There is no more generous or just ruler in Cyrodiil, if I say so myself.
I'm Ulene Hlervu, Castle Mage. Perhaps you've been warned off me as a scandalous, blasphemous scoffer and cynic.
The characterization is completely accurate. I despise the gods and those who bow before them.
I'm Tolisi Girith. I'm a maid at Riverview. And it's no picnic, I'll tell you.
I'm the charwoman at Riverside. Tanasa Arano. I clean up after Voranil and his parties.
Allow me to extend my congratulations on your daring victory over the evil forces of Oblivion. I am at your service.
Me? I'm Falanu. House Hlaalu. As if that matters here.
A perfect tomato... one taste, and it is gone forever. And then... a lifetime of searching for the next one.
Undena Orethi. I am a pilgrim in search of the perfect tomato. It is my grail, and I shall follow it all my life.
Yes. I'm Boderi Farano, Mages Guild. You want Advanced Training in Mysticism? I think I can fit you in...
Put on The Feed Bag! I'm Delos Fandas. We got food and drink, and lots of it.
Dovyn Aren. Yeah, I still do training. I'm not what I used to be, but I can still teach Alteration just fine.
Othrelos. I'm a Sneak... Advanced Sneak, in fact. And I train Sneaks. No law against it.
Fathis Ules. I've got a nice house. I have a little income... quite comfortable. Time is light on my hands.
Ulen Athram. Of the Kragenmoor Athrams. Made my fortune in the flin trade, and now I'm here in the city, living the life of ease.
Dralora Athram. I came here with Ulen fifteen years ago. Best thing we ever did.
Good day, stranger. Soris Arenim is my name.
I'm Myvryna Arano. I... persuade people.
Dranas Llethro. I just got back from Solstheim. Boy, was that a mess. And now I'm out of work.
A mighty feat of arms! The bards of Cyrodiil will be singing of the Fall of the Great Gate for years to come!
I'm sure all of Bruma joins me in saluting your help in keeping the hordes of Oblivion at bay.
We all owe you a debt of gratitude for closing that Oblivion Gate. Thank you.
I'm Uravasa Othrelas, priest of Mara. I'm also a Speechcraft trainer. I can help you make... different mistakes, at least.
I'm Fathis Aren, Count Bravil's staff wizard. I can teach you Conjuration... anything to relieve the tedium of castle patronage.
Drels Theran. I'm the count's Special Inquisitor in charge of suppressing the Renrijra Krin insurgents.
How do you do? I'm Tadrose Helas, Smith of the Bravil Fighters Guild chapter and trainer for Armorers.
Yes. I am Varon Vamori, Wit and Wordsmith. Bravil's foremost Bard and Advanced Trainer in Speechcraft.
If it isn't the toast of Leyawiin! How can I help you?
I'm Avrus Adas. I'm the priest of Zenithar at the Leyawiin Chapel.
Alves Uvenim, Journeyman of the Guild. Welcome to Leyawiin. I don't believe we've been introduced.
Alval Uvani. I'm an evil wizard. I like blowing things up.
And I have LOTS of time on my hands, since I'm LOADED with gold.
So I blow things up. And burn them. And frost them. And shock the living daylights out of them.
But I'm a smart, law-abiding evil wizard, because I only blow up my own stuff.
So don't get any ideas about murdering me and looting my gold...
Aside from the fact that I'll kick your ass... it's against the law, and you'll rot in jail for it.
So how do like THEM apples?
You! You're... No, you're not one of them. Still, you've no business being here. And if you see them, tell them Erver is ready and waiting.
I know they're coming. They'll come for you. Like they came for my sister. Put her on the Hill of Suicides.
Why are you here again? You'll only draw attention to us, give them one more reason to attack!
You? Why would I want to talk with you? Very well, out with it before I change my mind and add you to my list of experiments!
I suppose you think you have something important to say? Hurry up!
Rendil Drarara, chef extraordinaire at your service.
You haven't truly eaten a decent meal until you've had my Strawberry Harrada, Greenmote Lime Surprise, and Spiderling Under Glass!
Make this brief, I have a pot of Grummite Gumbo simmering on my fire at home.
You're new here, so I'll try to be patient with you.
I am compiling a taxonomy of every living thing in the Shivering Isles, the weather, changes in the moon and stars, and their interrelationships.
I must not be interrupted! My work requires the highest degree of concentration. I hope I won't have to repeat myself.
Can't you see I was in the middle of my daily dewfall survey? Now I have to start all over again.
You've interrupted my tree growth measurements! You've ruined a whole day's work! Why can't you just leave me alone?
I'm sure you didn't see it, but there was a very interesting beetle right there. Now it's gone, of course.
How will I ever finish the Encylopedia Sheothia with these constant interruptions!?
Is it so hard to leave me alone to get some work done? My wind and humidity measurements must be VERY precise!
Now it's all... ruined... I have to start everything over from the beginning!
Why won't you just leave me alone? What do you want?
I would prefer that you didn't disturb me at home. My research is exhausting and I don't like to be bothered here.
My Lord. I have waited for your return. Why have you forsaken me? I am your most... adoring subject! I am yours to command, body and soul!
My Lord, what is mine is yours.
For you, Lord Sheogorath, I'll make time. I'm sure you want to ask me all about my research.
I'm Felas Sarandas. Don't breathe on me.
Try not to cough on me.
Try not to stand so close.
The Fringe is outside Lord Sheogorath's mercy... but not his justice.
I'm sorry to bother you, Lord, but there seems to have been a misunderstanding.
A small token of your appreciation might clear this up, or perhaps it's better if we leave at this time.
My Lord, it seems there has been some misunderstanding.
Ordinarily, we could clear this up with a token payment, but under the circumstances, the peace of the Realm requires that I escort you away.
Your Grace, you have committed a crime. Only the Lord Sheogorath is above the laws of this Realm.
You must return any property that does not belong to you. Now, will you serve your sentence in the dungeon, or pay reparations?
My pardon, Your Grace, but Lord Sheogorath's justice applies to all within His Realm.
You must return any stolen items. I regret that I have no choice but to escort you to the dungeon, as you are short of the required reparations.
Submitting to Sheogorath's justice is wise. Will you pay reparations, or serve your sentence? Either way, your stolen goods are forfeit.
Decided to mend your ways? It's the dungeon for you, then, since you lack the gold for reparations. Your stolen goods are forfeit, of course.
Halt, lawbreaker! Lord Sheogorath's justice demands reparations or it's the dungeon for you. Any stolen goods will be confiscated.
Drop your weapon! Hand over your stolen goods and face the Lord's justice. Pay your due reparations, or it's the dungeon for you.
You thought you could escape Lord Sheogorath's justice? Your stolen goods are now forfeit, and you can either pay reparations or face the dungeons.
Halt, scofflaw! You can't afford to pay reparations for your crimes, so it's off to the dungeon for you. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
Come with me, scum. Those who can't afford to pay reparations must face Lord Sheogorath's dungeons. I'm confiscating your stolen goods as well.
Hand over your stolen property, lawbreaker! If only you could afford to pay reparations... too bad, it's the dungeon for you.
You're trespassing here.
You're trespassing! Leave now, or I'll arrest you!
My Lord! Autkendo Jansa sent me to find you. She requests your immediate assistance.
My Lord. I'm glad to see you. We have a developing situation that requires your attention.
What are your orders, m'Lord?
How may I serve you, Lord?
We are all that are left. The others were struck down by Order. How did this happen?
I know we are but lowly males, but we are at your service. Shall we follow you into battle?
I am all that is left. The others were struck down by Order. How did this happen?
I know I am only a lowly male, but I am at your service. Shall I follow you into battle?
What are your orders?
I follow Adeo, your Grace. If she follows you, then so do I.
Your Grace, Adeo has been waiting for you. Please, speak with her at once.
The Wellspring is restored!
You have saved us. We are forever grateful, your Grace.
Please, allow me to teach you this spell, so that you may summon our kind to you in times of need.
Also accept this gift of armor. It is the least I can do to show thanks for your help.
No! The Wellspring!...
They've stopped it up. You... you must make it to the Wellspring, and let the waters flow...
Forgive me, but now is not a time for talk. We must reach the Wellspring with all possible haste. If it is damaged, we are lost.
You have my thanks for freeing me, but... Just who are you?
You must set me free!
The barrier can't be broken by you. It's too tough... use the chime! Ring the chime, and that may shatter it!
We must find Dylora and free her!
Thank you for coming. I apologize for summoning you. The blame is mine.
We've lost control of Pinnacle Rock. Syl let them in... We had no idea she would turn on us.
They captured our commander, Dylora, and have her imprisoned somewhere inside. Our first priority must be rescuing her.
Your Grace, there is trouble! You must come quickly!
I exist to serve, Your Grace.
Your Grace must assist us, or we could be lost to this Realm.
You should not be here, Inquisitor. Perhaps you are lost? I have business to attend to. Excuse me.
Kill the Aureals. Don't stop until every last one of them is dead.
Victory is ours! I have already instructed my subordinates to kindle the Altar of Rapture.
It is my honor to sacrifice myself on the Altar of Despair at Lord Sheogorath's command.
You've served Sheogorath well. Farewell. I go now to kindle the Altar of Despair.
Begone, mortal, or you will soon find yourself between the Mazken and their prey. A most dangerous place to be.
I am honored to assist Lord Sheogorath's emissary.
A mortal wandering the halls of holy Cylarne... and a male no less. Explain yourself.
What is your business here?
Your betrayal of the Aureals was a strategem worthy of one of my own people! Victory by means of treachery is the sweetest kind.
Your name will be hailed whenever we toast this day's victory in our halls at Pinnacle Rock.
Your Grace, the situation is grim. Passwall is under attack. We are outmatched and outnumbered.
Last night, as dusk fell, the spire at the center of town became active. Soon after, the area around it began to crystallize and change.
It wasn't long after that the Knights came.
Are the Mazken prepared?
Were you able to provide the Mazken with aid? We have little in the way of supplies here. No healing. No restoration.
If you've done all that you can do, are you prepared for battle?
The enemy comes. Prepare yourself.
Victory is ours... for the moment.
We must discuss our next move. The spire is obviously their source of power. This battle will not end until we find a way to shut it down.
We will not be able to hold this position for long, Your Grace.
Your Grace! You... you're alive! Truly, you are the greatest warrior ever to hold the seat of Dementia!
I was certain that no one could survive the spire's collapse, but here you are! By the Staff, you are more than worthy to lead us.
I fear that our work is not yet done. The area is still overrun with Knights that were not destroyed in the spire.
You should return to the Palace and speak with Sheogorath. Ask him how he plans to defend this realm.
The citizens of Passwall must begin to rebuild. Much has been lost, and I fear that this is only the beginning.
Your Grace! We didn't expect you here. Grakendo Udico is in command. You should speak with her.
What orders would you give me, Your Grace?
The Knights are sure to attack again.
The battle is upon us. There is no time for conversation.
We've managed to slow them down this time.
We've lost so many...
Head to Xeddefen, Your Grace. By your will, we shall hold this position.
Xeddefen is the goal, Your Grace. We will hold the town as long as we can.
You've survived! It... it cannot be!
Your Grace, I bend my knee to you. How you survived the collapse, I cannot imagine.
There are still Knights of Order in the area. I fear that this occupation will not recede until the war is over.
War has come to the Shivering Isles at last. We stand ready to protect these lands.
Things are still quiet at Xeddefen, Your Grace. However, we are still finding the smaller Obelisks.
Your victory at Xeddefen was well won, but the war still carries on.
Sheogorath has vanished? He proves his cowardice! Leaving us here to die at the hands of Order.
Forgive me, Your Grace, but you are not permitted to pass within Pinnacle Rock.
No mortal may enter the halls of Pinnacle Rock.
State your business. Cylarne is holy ground, unfit for mortals.
Shall I continue with you, Lord?
You wish an escort, Lord?
Your work is done here, Your Grace. I'm sure Sheogorath will want news of your success.
Lord, you know that Pinnacle Rock is ours and ours alone. You may not enter.
Allow me to serve you, my Lord.
What is it, Emissary?
Madgod's blessings.
Since the Xivilai Anaxes, lord of the Savage Garden, has fallen, you must now face me in battle.
There is but one path forward, and I hold the key.
You destroyed the Sigil Tower at Ganonah. My kin say you fought well.
You test my patience, mortal. You are in my service. I expect my orders to be carried out.
You cannot deceive me. Anaxes has fallen. Now I must restore order to the Garden myself, and this angers me.
Anaxes is free. Order is restored to the Savage Garden. You have served me well.
In return for your service, I will give you the key to the Forbidden Grotto, if you still wish it.
This area is off limits, worm! Get back to your cage!
You are not to speak to me, worm.
You should not be here, mortal. Your blood is forfeit, your flesh is mine!
Be quick about it, mortal.
My Lord! Aurmazl Zudeh sent me to find you. She requests your immediate assistance.
I follow Issmi, your Grace. If she follows you, then so do I.
Your Grace, Issmi has been waiting for you. Please speak with her.
Is Your Grace prepared to enter Brellach now? We cannot delay for long.
We've lost control of Brellach. Thadon let them in... We had no idea he would turn on us.
They captured our commander, Staada, and have her imprisoned somewhere inside. Our first priority must be rescuing her.
Greetings, stranger. Are you here to help us drive the Mazken out of Cylarne?
Victory is ours! I have already selected a candidate for the honor of kindling the Altar of Rapture.
I will now claim the honor of victory for myself here on the Altar of Despair.
This is no place for a mortal. We are about to join battle against the Mazken. You'd best stand aside.
Greetings, Emissary. We await your command.
Those traps up ahead will cut my Aureals to pieces!
But if you can get that gate near the bridge open, we can bypass their traps and meet them blade-to-blade!
We'll hold our position here until you get that gate open. May Sheogorath's madness guard and guide you!
We can't advance until you get that gate open!
The Altar of Despair is ours! We'll hold our position here and cut the remaining Mazken to pieces when they try to retake it!
The time for speech is ended. Come!
You served out the Mazken with their own medicine. Not the most glorious victory, perhaps, but Cylarne is ours at last thanks to you.
Thanks to you, the Mazken have been utterly defeated!
Help us hold the Altar against the Mazken's counterattack!
Your Grace, a dark time has been thrust upon us. Passwall is under attack. We are outmatched and outnumbered.
At first light, the spire at the center of town became active. Immediately, the area around it began to crystallize and change.
Soon after that, the sky darkened and the knights came.
Have you prepared the Aureals?
Have you provided the soldiers with aid? We have little in the way of supplies here. No healing. No restoration.
If you have done all that you can, are you prepared to face the enemy?
With all due respect, the hour grows late and the situation grows darker. If we are to complete this plan, you must go now.
I... I cannot believe it! You survived! We were certain that your light had been lost!
I apologize for doubting you, Your Grace. You are a most worthy leader, perhaps the greatest warrior to ever hold the Seat of Mania.
But I fear that our work is not yet done. The area is still overrun with Knights that were not destroyed in the spire.
Passwall must have a new dawn. The struggle will be great, but I have no doubt that we shall overcome this dark time.
Your Grace! We didn't expect you here. Aurig Desha is in command. You should speak with her.
We will keep fighting until the last of us is dead.
The battle is upon us, this is no time for talk.
Perhaps this time we will have more than a few moment's rest.
Every time it gets quiet, they come back stronger and in greater numbers.
Head to Xeddefen, Your Grace. We will hold this position.
May the light and your mother's grace guide you to Xeddefen and the means to topple this menace.
You've survived! It is a miracle! Hail the warrior Duke of Mania!
By the light, how did you make it out of there?
Only a true warrior could have accomplished this task. The Aureals shall sing your story for eons to come.
Forgive me, Your Grace, but you are not permitted to pass within Brellach.
No mortal may enter the halls of Brellach.
Halt. Mortals are not permitted within the walls of holy Cylarne.
Lord, you know that Brellach is ours and ours alone. You may not enter.
Feel free to take what you need. The fruits of the conservatory are for all to enjoy.
Welcome to the Greenmote Silo.
This area is off limits!
Look what has been done to Passwall. This is what Order brings. I gladly bend my knee to Sheogorath.
Lord Sheogorath. Your Aureal stand true.
My soul for Sheogorath.
Speak quickly.
I have been expecting you. The full Council has already considered the matter of Martin's claim to the Imperial Throne in detail.
Where is Martin? I was told that he had arrived in the capital.
I never thought it would come to this... the Amulet... Martin must use it against Him! We have no choice!
I am at the Emperor Martin's command.
You did not expect to see me again, did you? You have no grasp of the power that my father has at his command.
You think you can stop us? Soon Mehrunes Dagon will walk upon Tamriel for the first time since the Mythic Age, and our victory will be complete.
Come, my father is waiting to welcome you to Carac Agaialor.
Why do you delay? Do you fear to face Mankar Camoran himself? As well you should.
So here you are at last. The lackey of the Septim pretender. You still think you have a chance, don't you?
We knew you would find your way here eventually. But it is of no consequence.
You should not keep my father waiting any longer. He expected you hours ago. Come, you came here to see him, did you not?
I have nothing else to say to you. But my father wants to speak with you before we send you on your way.
You made it. I didn't think you'd have any trouble. Let's get these Bands off you ...
... there. You're not a prisoner of the Forbidden Grotto any longer.
Let me come with you. Let me help you kill Mankar Camoran. I am not without power.
You wear the Bands, but you're no prisoner. Who are you? What are you doing here?
Not now. Just do as I say until the dremora leaves.
I'm eager to help you defeat my former Master, if you're willing to accept my help.
Let's put an end to Mankar Camoran and his evil Paradise.
Let's get into the next Grotto. I'm sure we can find a quiet place to remove the Bands there.
I'm ready to help you, if you're ready to accept my help.
Come into the High Hall of Judgment. Let us test ourselves against one another once and for all.
You have come to dedicate yourself to Lord Dagon's service.
This pact must be sealed with red-drink, the blood of Lord Dagon's enemies.
Take up the dagger and offer Lord Dagon the sacrificial red-drink as pledge of your own life's blood, which shall be his in the end.
Well done. You are now a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn, one of the Chosen. Your life belongs to Lord Dagon.
You must slay the sacrifice to bind yourself fully to Lord Dagon's service. Lord Dagon thirsts for blood.
You were told to sit down. Are you incapable of following such simple instructions?
From the Blades, did you say? Jauffre sent you? What's this about? Quickly, now.
What happened? Where's Martin? I must congratulate him! Mehrunes Dagon is defeated! Cast back into Oblivion! We've won!
Hail, Champion!
Is there something you need, Champion?
Go away! I don't want whatever you're selling!
I told you to leave me alone! Go away!
Oblivion take you! What is it you want from me?
Look what you've done! Spoiled my invisibility! This is my reward for trying to help the wretched villagers?
You've been suspended from the guild. You'd better see Raminus Polus if you want fix things.
I presumed it was only a matter of time before you'd be expelled. Once again, I am proven correct.
Should you decide to further waste the guild's time, Raminus Polus at the Arcane University can reinstate you.
You've chosen a side, little one. You'll get what's coming to you eventually.
I'll not have anything to do with you. Begone.
I've already given you everything you need. Unless I'm mistaken, we have little more to say to one another.
Hello, my little friend. I have something that might interest you...
I've committed most of the book to memory, but I took the time to write down a passage you might find useful.
It contains instructions for acquiring a very special power. You'll want to read it carefully, and then return to Cloud Top.
I consider this to be more than a worthy reward for your help; I believe you'll agree... assuming you're careful.
Can't you see I'm busy? Without the translation, this book is useless. Now go away and let me work.
I must put this book in a safe place. I have no time to talk now.
Back again, are you? Do you have the book THIS time?
Any progress yet? You should be working on getting the book for me.
You don't want to fail me again.
I grow weary of waiting. Where is my book?
Ready to find J'skar?
Have you pulled that little prank yet?
Well, if it isn't my little helper. Have you retrieved that book for me yet?
Be a dear, and fetch me that book like I asked. Hurry along now.
You again. Have you reconsidered? The offer still stands. Say the word, and I'll tell you all about it.
Ah, yes. You are a Guild Mage, are you not? Yet, different from the others. Yes, yes -- this is good.
There's a small matter with which you may be able to assist. It's nothing worth involving your guild in, I assure you.
Best if kept just between us, yes? So, what say you?
Hello there. Hmm... you might do nicely. Are you interested in some work? I have a small task that needs accomplishing. You may be up to it.
You're a bold little thing, aren't you? I'm afraid you're of no use to me. Goodbye.
Begone, weakling. I have no use for you.
I'm afraid your journey ends here, traveler.
I'll be taking whatever you're carrying. After you're dead, of course. I do hope it's more than the last few had. They were most disappointing.
Oh, don't let me bother you. You just stay safe on the road.
Pardon me, but did I hear you say that you're a traveling merchant?
Hello there! I must say, I'm quite surprised to see anyone else here.
With all the trouble on the road recently, I expected to be the only one staying at the inn. It's a welcome surprise though, believe me.
Are you staying for a while, or simply just passing through?
So, what of the Rogue mage? Has he been found?
Hello, Associate. To earn a recommendation from me, you need simply prove you are able-bodied and prepared to learn something in the process.
I find it surprising that you're speaking to me again without having completed your task.
What is it, Associate? Don't tell me you're here for a recommendation.
Hello there. Is there something with which I can assist you? Perhaps you're curious about joining the Mages Guild?
Did you want something? You're not here to join the Mages Guild, are you?
Well done, my friend. This mine is once again safe for the miners.
Let's clear this mine of those goblins.
Ahh... you've got the weapons. Let's talk about that weapons shipment you brought.
Good that you made it. You should talk to Rienna.
You're a likely looking prospect. Thinking about the Fighters Guild?
Well, have you found that imp gall for me yet? I've got some research I need to get to.
It's about time someone from the Fighters Guild showed up. I've got work for you to do. I need imp gall for my research.
Hey... Hey! How... What are... What are you... doing here? You're not my... Not my friend. What... You know, what do you... want?
Hey! My friend! You made it, huh? That's... That's great. Did... Did you want to just relax, or... Did you want something... something else?
Wha...? What do you want... friend? Wait... You're not my friend. If you were my friend., you'd give me something. Like, you know... skooma!
Huh? What do you want? Sorry, can't talk... now. I'm with my... my lady friend here. Talk to me... later... Not here... Not in the hotel... Okay...
Oh... Hi. Hi again. You're the one who... who was going to bring me some skooma. To be my friend. Yeah... I remember you... now...
And what might you want... peasant?
Yes, good sir? How may I help you?
Yes, my lady? How may I help you?
Ah, my dear friend. It is so good to see you.
Silencer! At last you've arrived! Fear not, for the crisis that has threatened the Dark Brotherhood has finally come to an end.
I am Arquen, Speaker for the Black Hand. As you can see, we have dealt with the betrayer, Lucien Lachance! No longer will you serve as his puppet!
It seems Lachance wanted revenge against the Dark Brotherhood for some reason, and used you to do his dirty work.
But now, we can begin anew! I bestow upon you the title of Speaker. You will take Lucien Lachance's place on the Black Hand! Welcome!
As you know, the Black Hand is now in a state of disarray. Lachance ordered you to kill us off! We five, including you, are now all that remain.
Even worse, you killed the Listener! The Black Hand without a Listener is like a hand with no thumb. Even the Listener's successor is dead!
So, we have no choice but to invoke an ancient ritual. We must wake the Night Mother from her slumber, and seek her guidance!
Between the hours of midnight and 3:00 AM, ask me about the Night Mother, and we will away to our Lady's home. Only then will the ritual begin.
Dear Speaker, when darkness shrouds the Empire, we can travel to the resting place of the Night Mother, and begin the ritual of awakening.
I don't like the look of you. Pay your respects and get out.
Have respect for the dead while you are down here.
Behold, the Night Mother! The locals call this statue the Lucky Old Lady. They have no idea how lucky they really are.
For this stone effigy masks the entrance into the Dark Brotherhood's most revered unholy site -- the crypt of the Night Mother herself!
In a moment, we will begin. I will recite an incantation, and we can proceed down into the crypt and seek an audience with the Night Mother.
I know this is all very overwhelming, dear child. Just follow along, and you'll be fine. Now, let's go see what the future holds, shall we?
Honored Listener! I offer myself as your humble servant and guide. Please, allow me to mentor you in your new role.
Here is what I believe we should do next. I will stay here and attempt to reestablish this Sanctuary. I will begin recruiting new members.
You must fullfill your new duties. The statue in Bravil serves as a conduit between the Night Mother and the Listener.
Once a week, you must visit the statue. Talk to it. You will be presented with a list of names and locations.
These are people who have prayed to the Night Mother! They request a visit from a Speaker, to arrange someone's assassination.
All you need to do is visit the statue once a week, get the list of names and locations, and pass it on to me here in the Sanctuary.
Do this, and I will give you your share of the Sanctuary's weekly earnings. There is so much work to be done. So much work...
The Night Mother wishes for you to take some time to consider your new position. We will speak when we are back in the Sanctuary.
Now is not the time for us to speak! We must hear the words of the Night Mother! She will guide us in this hour of despair!
Yes? Is there something else I can help you with?
I think I'll study this shrine a bit longer. You can make your way out here. I thank you again for your help. Please, take this token of my thanks.
Yes? We should keep moving.
Excellent. A fine example of a Daedric shrine. Sorry for the trouble getting here. Let's keep moving.
What can I do for you? We need to head to that shrine.
Ah, you must be from the Fighters Guild. Excellent! I'm looking forward to our investigation. Fascinating subject, these Daedra.
Greetings, most honorable Listener. The time has come for you to hear the whispers of death. Go to Bravil, and listen to the Night Mother.
So, the Night Mother has spoken! I will make sure this information reaches the appropriate family members. Ah yes, here are your weekly earnings.
I will see you next week, most honorable Listener.
I'm sorry, most honorable Listener, but I've already given you your weekly earnings. Please, come back again after you've spoken to the Night Mother.
Well, well. This is quite a surprise. I thought you were Traven's lapdog, doing whatever he said, and yet here you are.
Good that you've finally seen the light. The cause will benefit from your assistance.
What's this?
Is this the best your pathetic guild could do? If so, our work will be easier than I suspected. And to think, Traven has sent you to defeat us?
I should've killed you outright when I had the chance. Well, life is all about second chances, isn't it? I won't waste this one.
I see Bolor was unsuccessful in delaying you. Very well; I shall reanimate him once we are done here.
Perhaps we shall chat for a while, since you really have no other options?
I must say, I expected Arch-Mage Traven, rather than his star pupil. I am disappointed to see that he could not face me himself.
I have met so many of his predecessors over the years. I developed a particular fondness for Galerion, ill-preserved though he may be.
But here you are instead. Skilled enough to make it this far, which speaks volumes about you. Perhaps you'll be as useful to me as Traven would.
Have you seen it? Have you seen the light? The bright, shining light? I know it. It waits for you. Speak with Ravel. He knows the way.
I had to find someone else to bring me the Crown of the Ayleids, since you were unwilling to help me.
Be that as it may. I now have a task that should be better to suited someone of your particular talents.
Here you are at last. I know exactly where the Throne Room lies. Your job is simply to get me there safely.
Yes? Is there a problem?
You are about to witness the glorious rebirth of Ayleid civilization. Stand aside!
Just follow the Captain's orders.
Huh? Sorry... I ain't interested....
Come on! Run while there's still time! The Guard still holds the road, but it's only a matter of time before they're overwhelmed!
We... we did it? And I'm still in one piece! I mean, of course we did it. I never doubted us for a second.
If we make it through this alive, I'll be amazed.
Savlian's not really the captain, you know. We're just following him because he's the highest ranking officer left alive.
I honestly don't know how to repay you. I'm not a wealthy man by any means, but perhaps I could assist you in other ways.
You're awake.... good. I didn't want to disturb you. I suppose you're wondering what I did with Selene?
The authorities at the Imperial City took her off the ship as soon as we docked. I was also informed that there was a reward for her capture.
Here you go. Don't spend it all in one place... unless it's here of course!
I suggest you rest in your room until we arrive back at the Imperial City. Graman should have us underway soon.
Oh thank goodness! That horrid woman kept threatening me! She said if I didn't come up with the loot she'd throw me to the slaughterfish.
Now that Selene is locked up safely below, I think we can all breathe a little easier. I can't thank you enough.
I don't wish to get underway until Selene is safely locked in a room on the inn deck.
Thank goodness you arrived when you did! I feared that I'd be thrown to the slaughterfish.
I... can't speak to you... talk to her...
Well met. Welcome to the Bloated Float. She's the finest inn on the water in all Cyrodiil.
Has the deed been done?
Do you really think that I'm surprised to see you here? I let you find me. What better place to get rid of you than all the way out here.
No messy bodies left behind, no evidence. I was sloppy last time with Roland's lover, and I won't make the same mistake twice.
After I'm through with you, I'll find Roland and finish what I started. I knew hiring you was a mistake, but I had to keep up appearances.
The damn "Order" insisted we get you into the picture. I think after I'm done with Roland, Gilen and Grey-Throat will have to be dealt with.
Quite a list of things to do, wouldn't you say? Well, enough of my monologue. Time to feed!
Just out for a brisk walk. Helps clear the head. Any other information I can help with?
Well, don't just stand there! Go and kill him!
Keep me informed. I'm very interested to hear where he is hiding.
Have you slain Roland?
A letter, eh?
Is there more I can help you with?
Welcome. You're now in the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood. Few outside our circle have ever set foot in our hallowed hall.
We are, for lack of a better word, defenders. We guard this city from an infestation that plagues it. We are vampire hunters.
I'm sure you are familiar with those despicable beings. Feeding on the innocent as if they were cattle. Well, this group was formed to combat them.
Alas, we are but 3 old men, not able to match the fighting prowess of the vampire. We lack the strength to defeat them in battle.
Shhh. Not here. Keep following.
It's an honor to finally meet you. When I heard you were in town, I just had to send for your help. Your reputation precedes you.
Oh, allow me to introduce myself. I am Seridur.
Thank you for coming. You may recognize that statue over there on the table. The very one that you recently sold -- for less than its true worth.
As you may know, I am somewhat of an enthusiast for Ayleid antiquities. In my own modest way, I have amassed a rather considerable collection.
I have recently become interested in obtaining the complete set of these ancient statues. I believe that ten still exist.
No mere shopkeeper knows their true worth. If you bring them to me when you find them, I will pay you double for each one.
Yes? You have something of interest to me?
Ah, yes. My treasure-hunting friend. What can I do for you?
It's good to see you in the real world. I'm indebted to you for rescuing me from my nightmare.
I suppose thanks are only a small token of my appreciation. Allow me to reward you for your bravery.
I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of coin, but allow me to present you with something that may help in your travels.
I feel as though I'll be trapped here forever, and I don't even know why.
Have you found an exit to this place yet? We must escape!
I've lost my way. This place looks so familiar, but I can't remember how I got here. Can you help me?
Here to sell me more Nirnroot?
Please... please. The Grand Elixir of Exploration takes incredible concentration to create. So, shhhhhh.
You have the next batch of Nirnroot yet?
Hey! Good to see you again!
It would be much easier to make the Elixir if you weren't interrupting me.
Any more luck finding Nirnroot?
Leave me to my work if you want the Elixir made properly.
How goes the search?
Please, listen to what I have to say; it could be lucrative for the both of us.
So, you've brought something for me to examine?
What can I do for you today? You here to bring me some Nirnroot?
This is a travesty. A complete and utter travesty. The crystal ball is just sitting there in the hold, but I'll be damned if I'm going back onboard.
And nobody will help me. Nobody! Not with those spirits roaming the decks. I don't suppose you'll help me? No, of course you won't...
No luck yet, hmm? Please, don't give up. That crystal ball means so much to me. It was my mother's, you see...
You did it! You actually made it back with the crystal ball! Oh thank you! Here, please take this as a reward!
It's the captain's enchanted cutlass. I managed to grab it when I was in his cabin, before his spirit chased me out! Oh, thank you so very much!
Oh, hello, dear friend! Let me just say once more how happy I am to have my crystal ball back. I'll never forget your selflessness and bravery!
So good to see you again!
I'm sorry, I'm very busy now. There's still much work to be done. Good day.
What can I get for you, my good friend?
I could spare a moment. What did you need?
Welcome back to the Wawnet Inn. Looking for a room? Or did you have any more Shadowbanish Wine for me perhaps?
I hope your expedition has been more successful than mine.
I don't suppose I could convince you to help me recover my research notes?
Any luck on those bottles of Shadowbanish Wine yet?
Welcome to the Wawnet Inn. Could I interest you in a room or perhaps a bit of wine?
I have nothing to say to someone of your manifest stupidity.
You have lifted the curse. All of Vitharn thanks you, Lord Sheogorath. You may keep my helmet. It never did me much good.
You have lifted the curse. All of Vitharn thanks you. You may keep my helmet. It never did me much good.
I am Count Cirion. What does the mighty Lord Sheogorath need here among the shades of Vitharn? Have you come to mock us?
I am Count Cirion, and you have violated the inner sanctum of Vitharn. What say you in your defense?
I feel something different...the curse feels lighter somehow.
Was my sin so great that I must suffer for all eternity?
Have you dealt with Brithaur? I'm not getting any younger here waiting for you. You must hurry and get rid of him!
Firm arms. A strong back. Yes. You'd do nicely. It's a shame. Time will ravage you, destroy you. Whither you. But there are... alternatives.
Time need not slow you. Tell me, have you ever considered placing yourself on display?
Well? What is it you need. Please, be quick about it... the seconds are ticking by as we speak. Ohhhh. There goes several more.
Be quick please, I have a farm to run. It isn't going to run itself, now is it?
Can't you see I'm busy? My house. So orderly. And now this! Where do I even begin?
This Bay horse will serve you well. Try to serve him just as well.
You need to see Ugak if you want to buy a horse. She's inside.
I'm the Wizard Carahil, Mages Guild, master of the Anvil chapter.
Excuse me. My name is Angalmo. Can I help you?
Honditar is the name. I'm a hunter and mountain man.
Blessings of the Nine. I'm Ohtesse the Healer. By the grace of Mara, I offer Advanced Training in the Restoration Arts.
I'm Errandil, Living Saint of Arkay, and the Chapel's chief crusader against the wicked practice of necromancy.
Ohtimbar, Fighters Guild Guardian. Maybe you saw me in the Arena, couple years ago? I was a contender.
I got out while I still had the original set of legs, arms, and eyes. Fighters Guild is a perfect place for me now.
What are you doing in here? Wander in by mistake? This is the Mages Guild. You want a barn or sheep pen or something.
Oh, dear. A budding spellcaster. How charming. I'm Falcar. I'm what a real wizard looks like.
I'm Magician Orintur of the Mages Guild. I divide my time between the Cheydinhal Guild and my own private studies at Willow Bank.
I'm Eilonwy. I'm only a conjurer, but Orintur is a full Magician. Isn't he wonderful?
I'm Voranil. I'm guessing you're angling for an invitation to one of my super parties.
Well, forget about it. Invitation only. And no invitation for you, stranger.
Blessings of the Nine. My name is Tumindil. I'm the chapel priest. I'm sure you can find your way around the chapel by yourself.
A sweetroll? But, of course, Salmo is famous for his sweetrolls! One taste, and you are in heaven... on top of the world, yes!
I'm Caranya, master wizard, and far too important to be talking to you. So go about your business, please?
You've come to Divine Elegance because you care about what you wear. And Palonirya has what you want... or no one has.
Welcome to the Mystic Emporium. Calindil is here, with all your needs, under one roof. Look, and buy. Nothing could be easier.
My name is Atraena. How do you do?
I'm Erissare Arenim. Soris is my husband.
Yes. My name is Umbacano.
Areldil. We don't have any business, do we? Then, perhaps, will you excuse me?
Good day. My name is Seridur. I don't believe we've met.
I'm Suurootan, proud owner of Novaroma, a little piece of Heartland Empire here in the lofty Jeralls.
Volanaro, at your service. Need a spell? Need an item recharged? Need a witty practical joke played on someone? I can handle it all.
Gilgondorin. Silverhome-on-the-Water has beds and food. What's your pleasure?
Take a chance on the Warlock's Luck!
Heh-heh. Just kidding. Everything is all perfectly safe. Tested it myself. Ungarion, retired adventurer. You may have heard of me?
I'm Ardaline. I'm the guild's Advanced Trainer in Alchemy here in Bravil.
Aryarie. Your friendly Guild Alchemist. Satisfaction guaranteed. No free samples.
Carandial. Mage-trained. Scholar by inclination. Student of our Aldmeri ancestors, the Ayleids.
Ranaline. I cook at the Lonely Suitor.
I am Hlidara Mothril, Lady Leyawiin's chaplain and chief advisor.
I assist Her Ladyship so that her enlightened policies might achieve the greatest  possible influence upon the affairs of County Leyawiin.
What we do here is our own business. Don't interfere.
I'm Muurine. If you have any secrets, I'm the one to tell. I won't share them with anyone but my family. Unless they're good ones, that is.
Hello there. I just finished a lovely conversation with Uncle Leo; it seems he's not feeling well today. Lost an arm.
You'd better have a good reason for interrupting me. Keeping these miscreants working this mudhole is no simple task.
If you must know, I am Cindanwe, foreperson. And don't let that liar Kishashi or that psycho Ranarr-Jo tell you any different.
You again? Make it quick. I have work to do.
Hello there. Have you reconsidered my offer?
Hmmm... how do you do? I'd say, very well from the look of things.
I'm Sontaire, spend one night with me and I'll remind you why they say "love hurts."
So, how'd you like to get together later and leaf through my octavo?
New around here? Well, we can start off by getting one thing straight.
The men around here are mine. You want fresh pickings, go out and scrounge up some leftovers in a settlement or something.
I don't like competition. Just stay away from the menfolk, and we'll get along just fine.
I bid you greetings and cheer, with the grace of a noble stallion. You seem to be of fine temper and wit, says the poet known as Halion.
As I look upon your face, you remind me of a summer's day. Of a distant and secret place not so far away.
You closed the gate? How did you do it? We can't thank you enough.
There's nothing left here for me. I'm getting out as soon as I can.
You can say what you like, but I'm never going back to Kvatch.
Excuse me, the Empire doesn't run itself, you know. Submit a complaint to the usual department and I'm sure someone will take care of it.
Feeding time is over, vampire! Go back to the grave that spawned you!
You're the Gray Fox! You're under arrest for... for... for all kinds of stuff! You're wanted dead or alive. I'm choosing dead.
You're wanted dead or alive, Gray Fox! This will be easier if you're dead.
Trespassing in the Imperial Palace is punishable by death or prison. Your choice.
Looks like you are in some trouble. Since we are friends, don't worry. I'll look the other way and take care of that fine for you.
So, the infamous criminal surrenders? This calls for a celebration! So... pay the fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are forfeit.
You decided to turn yourself in? Smart move. Pay your bounty, or serve your sentence... your choice... but your stolen goods are forfeit.
You decided to turn yourself in? Good. You lack the gold to pay your bounty, so you must serve out your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
Stop, criminal! I've heard of you. Your criminal exploits are well-known. Pay the fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are forfeit.
Stop! You violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
Stop right there, criminal scum! Nobody breaks the law on my watch! I'm confiscating your stolen goods. Now pay your fine or it's off to jail.
It's all over, lawbreaker! Your spree is at an end. I'll take any stolen goods you have. The next move is yours -- Pay your fine, or I haul you away!
Stop! You violated the law. Since you lack the funds to pay the court, you must serve out your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
Well now, what do we have here? Caught in the act and no gold to pay your fine? I'm confiscating your stolen goods. Now it's off to jail with ya!
Break the law on my watch, will ya? I'll be confiscating your stolen goods. Oh, and no gold to pay your fine, hmm? It's off to the lockup then!
What luck! You're trespassing! I'm a guard! And I LOVE my job!
You've overstayed your welcome here, I'm afraid.
Let me see your face...
You are the one from my dreams...
Then the stars were right, and this is the day.
Gods give me strength.
They cannot understand why I trust you. They've not seen what I've seen.
How can I explain?
Listen. You know the Nine? How They guide our fates with an invisible hand?
I can go no further. You alone must stand against the Prince of Destruction and his mortal servants. He must not have the Amulet of Kings!
Take the Amulet. Give it to Jauffre. He alone knows where to find my last son.
Find him, and close shut the jaws of Oblivion.
My guards are strong and true, but even the might of the Blades cannot stand against the Power that rises to destroy us.
The Prince of Destruction awakes, born anew in blood and fire. These cutthroats are but his mortal pawns.
Take my Amulet. Give it to Jauffre. I have a secret son, and Jauffre alone knows where to find him.
Find the last of my blood, and close shut the marble jaws of Oblivion.
The signs I read show the end of my path. My death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.
Come with us. Your destiny is bound up with mine, and with the fate of Tamriel itself.
Come with us...
Here you must find your own path.
But we will cross paths again before the end, I am sure of it.
This is only the beginning. Worse is yet to come.
They're only trying to do their duty. Come, let us play our parts...
Maybe the Emperor is right about you. The best way you can help is to let us do our jobs and don't get in our way.
The Emperor may trust you, but I don't. Stay out of our way.
Do we really have to go into that thing?
I don't think we're going to make it out of here alive.
The Captain's in charge. I'll follow his orders.
We really taught those bastards a lesson, didn't we ma'am?
We really taught those bastards a lesson, didn't we sir?
You need to close the Great Gate! We'll try to hold them off as long as we can!
We won a great victory here today! We now have the means to recover the Amulet of Kings from Mankar Camoran.
But we need to act quickly. Camoran will not take long to recognize his danger.
Remember, the portal closes behind you. Anything you need, carry it with you.
I'll have the ritual ready in the Great Hall when you arrive. Farewell.
We're too late... Mehrunes Dagon is here!
Lighting the Dragonfires will no longer save us... the barriers that protected us from Oblivion are gone...
I do what I must do. I cannot stay to rebuild Tamriel. That task falls to others.
Farewell. You've been a good friend, in the short time that I've known you.
But now I must go. The Dragon waits.
Come on! We need to get to the Dragonfires before it's too late!
Help me get past Dagon and into the Temple of the One! I'll do the rest!
What should we do now?
We should go to the Imperial City at once. Lead on.
By ancient tradition, I may not present myself as a candidate for the throne. I need you to formally present my claim to Chancellor Ocato.
Let's continue on to the Elder Council Chambers. Delay is dangerous.
Mehrunes Dagon knows that if I can reach the Temple of the One and light the Dragonfires, he has lost. Come on!
Come on! We have to protect Martin until he can light the Dragonfires in the Temple!
Good to see you again, sir. Martin was worried, but I knew you would bring back the Amulet of Kings for him.
Good to see you again, ma'am. Martin was worried, but I knew you would bring back the Amulet of Kings for him.
We have only once chance at this! Use the portal to Camoran's Paradise before it closes again!
I have everything in place for the ritual. I'll open the portal whenever you're ready.
I don't know what you'll find in Camoran's Paradise.
I do know the portal I create through the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will close behind you. You'll have to find another way back.
I believe that Mankar Camoran acts as the "anchor" for Paradise, just as a sigil stone anchors an Oblivion Gate in place.
Kill Mankar Camoran, and you will unmake his Paradise.
Shall I open the portal to Paradise? Are you ready?
Do you need something? Otherwise I should make my preparations for the ritual. There's no time to lose.
You found a way back! Does this mean... ?
You ... how can you be here?
No matter. You are too late to stop Lord Dagon's victory. Soon we will return to Tamriel, to rule over it as lords.
While you will remain here in the Eternal Garden... forever.
Have you brought help? We've been trapped here since the daedra overran the city.
It isn't that I don't believe you. But I won't go with you until I know everyone can leave here safely.
We've been through too much together already for me to just abandon them to their fate.
I heard about how you helped the Guard drive the daedra back. Well done.
I wondered if you'd come back. I admit, I've had my doubts about your story.
Unless you need something, let's continue on to Weynon Priory.
I'm waiting to discuss our battle plans with the Countess. Have you told her to meet me here yet?
Let the Countess know I'll be waiting for her in the Chapel of Talos.
When you're ready for battle, the Countess will order her men to stop closing the Gates outside the city.
My place is on the battlefield. The time for hiding in Cloud Ruler Temple is over. Come, let us go down to battle together.
We must hold the line until the Great Gate opens!
Greetings. What news from Cloud Ruler Temple?
I will call out my militia if necessary, but must we truly stand alone? I don't think we can survive the daedric onslaught.
Some help is better than nothing, but my militia are farmers and shopkeepers, not soldiers. I would recommend delaying until more help can arrive.
I appreciate the help that you have brought to Bruma. I begin to think we have a chance.
But my militia is no substitute for trained soldiers. Can we not wait for more help to arrive?
You are a diplomat as well as a warrior, it seems! I would prefer more men, of course, but if we must offer battle now, so be it.
I am ready for battle when you are, champion. What say you?
Come with me to the Chapel of Talos. I wish to speak with your lord.
Your place is on the battlefield. I have trusted you this far. Do not fail me.
We won't let you down, sir. The daedra will be sorry they messed with Bruma.
We won't let you down, ma'am. The daedra will be sorry they messed with Bruma.
Send them back to Oblivion! We'll hold the city in case any of them break through.
I wish we had more real soldiers.
We'll stand our ground as long as we can.
You're back. And you've got the Great Stone...
The last item for the ritual still eludes me, I'm afraid. The Mysterium Xarxes gives up its secrets reluctantly.
The supporting glyphs all point to Oblivion, but the signifier of the main symbol matches nothing ...
I'm sorry to burden you with my problems. I'll do my best to have an answer by the time you return with the Great Welkynd Stone.
I've made no progress on the fourth item. And every day that passes brings the Mythic Dawn closer to victory.
My research is moving forward again. It's only a matter of time before I decipher the third and fourth ingredients for the ritual.
I need some time to study the Mysterium Xarxes. I'll let you know when I learn something.
I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise.
The Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'.
In fact, daedric artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a Daedric Lord, from whence they derive their great power.
Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a daedric artifact. Bring it to me when you have acquired one.
I've made some progress on the Mysterium Xarxes. I think I've identified the section that deals with opening a portal to Camoran's Paradise.
I'm still studying the Mysterium Xarxes. Its corrupting power is terrible.
Harrow awaits within. You should not linger here.
Ah, you're back. I told Jauffre not to worry.
... I can see you have bad news. You didn't recover the Amulet, did you?
This whole business of being heir to the throne will take some getting used to.  Please bear with me.
While I'm getting oriented here, you should follow Jauffre's orders.
Gods blood! They came out of nowhere. Have you seen Grandmaster Jauffre?
Come on! We need to help the Grandmaster!
Poor Prior Maborel. He was dead when I came outside. Who could have done this?
Thanks for your help. I didn't think any of us were going to survive the attack.
I think we should find your friend Jauffre at once.
Do you think there are any more of those assassins about?
Let's continue on to Cloud Ruler Temple. I haven't had a good night's sleep since Kvatch was attacked.
Not much of a speech, was it? Didn't seem to bother them, though.
The Blades saluting me and hailing me as Martin Septim...
I don't mean to sound ungrateful. I know I would be dead by now if it weren't for you. Thank you.
But everyone expects me to suddenly know what to do. How to behave.
They want an Emperor to tell them what to do. And I haven't the faintest idea...
Let's not keep the Blades waiting.
Excuse me. Can I help you? Are you looking for Prior Maborel? Or Jauffre?
My progress on the Mysterium Xarxes is slow, I'm afraid. How goes your search for the Armor of Tiber Septim?
Why do you disturb me? I must free the Shrine so that I can sleep. It has been so long since I have slept.
I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise.
The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine. This was a terrible puzzle to me.
Unlike the Daedra Lords, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.
How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines.
This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next. Jauffre should tell it to you himself.
Thank Akatosh you're here! I have deciphered the final item for the ritual to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise!
The next section of the Mysterium Xarxes is very difficult. I haven't deciphered the rest of the ritual yet. I hope you are making better progress.
I look forward to fighting these daedra side by side with the Hero of Kvatch.
Let's talk after the battle is won.
Hail, daedra-slayer!
We did it! We showed those damned daedra a thing or two!
We're going to show them daedra a thing or two, aren't we ma'am?
We're going to show them daedra a thing or two, aren't we sir?
Thanks for the rescue. I didn't think we would make it out of the Chapel alive. Perhaps Akatosh guided you to us.
What is it, my friend?
I always wanted to see the Jerall Mountains. Beautiful, aren't they? Almost makes you forget why we're here.
I'm sure you hear it all the time, but I'd like to thank you personally for closing that Oblivion Gate outside Cheydinhal.
We were all expecting to become the next Kvatch, you know?
With the Count worrying more about his son than the defense of the city, things were looking pretty grim.
So, like I said, thanks. I'm glad I was able to come here and do my bit for our side, you know?
The Mythic Dawn won't dare try anything now that the best soldiers in Cyrodiil are defending Bruma!
Remember Kvatch, that's our watchword. We won't let that happen here, don't worry.
I can't stay long. Count Caro's orders were to return to Leyawiin as soon as Bruma was safe.
Is it always this cold up here? This weather would freeze the arse off an ogre.
I hope there are more reinforcements on the way. We can't hold Bruma by ourselves!
It's good to see some reinforcements from across Cyrodiil. It's been too long since we all stood together in a common cause.
But so few ... surely the other cities will send help?
The cities of Cyrodiil are finally rallying together to make a stand against the Oblivion invasion.
I'm starting to think we might actually beat these bastards!
We won't let those daedra take Bruma.
It's the waiting that gets to me. Why don't they just attack and get it over with?
You helped our city fight off those damned daedra. Now it's our turn to help Bruma.
Chancellor Ocato is expecting you. Proceed.
Regulus Terentius, Count Bravil. I'm really rather busy, and I doubt that you have anything to say that I need to hear.
And who in Shinji's name might you be? Look, if you're a spectator, go upstairs and talk to the Gatekeeper. This ain't no damned peep show.
And... Ah, I see. So, you're an Arena combatant. Well isn't that nice. Now get out of my face.
Great show, great show! You really brought down the house! Here's your gold. Now get some rest, and I'll see you next week!
Hey, what's wrong? Aren't they waiting for you up in the Arena?
Well, well, if it isn't the Spellslinger! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Butcher! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Shadowstep! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Black Arrow! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Skullcrusher! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Divine Avenger! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Messenger of Death! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Crimson Blade! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Man o' War! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Sir Slaughter! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Tamriel Terror! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Dragonheart! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't Lady Luck! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
Well, well, if it isn't the Iron Maiden! How's our new Grand Champion, huh? You ready to make me some money? Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ahem...
By the love of Shinji, you did it! You beat the Gray Prince! This... This is unbelievable! That makes you the best fighter the Arena has ever seen!
You've got Agronak's Raiment of Valor! Good! Give it to me! All right, now I give you your own. By Shinji, I... I'm shaking! This is amazing!
Okay, do... Do you want a Heavy Raiment of Valor or a Light Raiment of Valor? Your choice!
Ha ha! There's the new Arena Grand Champion! By Shinji, you look good in that Raiment! The way it accentuates your physique... Spectacular!
Now listen, I bet you're wondering what's next huh? Where does a Grand Champion go from here? Well I've been thinking...
Why not spice things up a bit, give the people of Cyrodiil what they really want? We revise the rules of competiton, offer a new kind of match...
I'm talking weekly shows, fights pitting you against... are you ready for this? Monsters! And maybe even some wild animals! Sounds great doesn't it?
I've had some people out collecting your new combatants. The wilderness is full of 'em! Let me know when you're ready for a match, and it's showtime!
Ha ha! There's the new Arena Grand Champion!  Now listen, I bet you're wondering what's next huh? Well I've been thinking...
But you need Agronak's Raiment! That's right, just go back to the Arena and take it right from his body! Go get it, and bring it back to me!
And if you're one of those idiots who thinks they have something to prove in the Arena, go over and talk to Owyn.
And... Wait, I know you. You're that new Champion, right? Hmph. I guess I know why you're here. But let me tell you, you're making a big mistake.
The Gray Prince is the best fighter the Arena has ever seen. He can't be beaten. Not by you. But hey, it's your right.
If you want to challenge Agronak, go right ahead. He lives down here in the Bloodworks. Do that, come talk to me again, and I'll arrange your match.
And... Wait, I know you. You're that new Champion, right? Oh, don't tell me you've actually challenged the Gray Prince to a match! Are you insane?
Agronak gro-Malog is the best fighter ever to step into an Arena. He can't be beaten! Not by you! But if you want to fight him, that's your right...
Well, you know the drill. You let me know when you're ready for a match, and Agronak will head up to the Arena and prepare for your arrival.
Just make sure you understand our rules of competition for this match. Fighting the Grand Champion, well... The rules are a bit different.
So, you've actually challenged the Gray Prince? Do you really know what you've gotten yourself into?
You again, huh? Look, I told you, if you want to challenge the Gray Prince that's your right. But don't say I didn't warn you.
Listen, sunshine, I ain't in the mood! You want something, talk to Owyn. He's right over there for Shinji's sake!
You again? You're becoming a real pain in my arse, you know that? I thought I made myself clear. You don't belong down here. Now get!
This is all so grisly and horrible, isn't it? The blood and bodies... But I've won so much money! I can't stop betting! I think I need help...
I am here to serve you, Arch-Mage.
What may I do for you, Arch-Mage?
Yes, Arch-Mage?
How may I help you, Arch-Mage?
May I be of some assistance, Arch-Mage?
I am at your command, Arch-Mage.
Have you returned with the ingredients you were sent to find?
I am very disappointed. I had hoped we would not meet again under these circumstances.
You have been suspended from the guild for the death of a guild member. Are you willing to do what is necessary to make amends?
You have been suspended from the guild for theft. Are you willing to do what is necessary to make amends?
Have you returned with the materials you were sent to collect?
It is unfortunate that we should meet for the first time under these circumstances, Associate.
You have been found guilty of killing a guild member. As such, your guild privileges have been suspended.
If you wish to be reinstated, you must perform a service for the guild. Are you willing to do so?
You have been found guilty of theft. As such, your guild privileges have been suspended.
It is unfortunate that we should meet under these circumstances, Associate.
Now, while the Shade of the Revenant blankets this world, I give these gems as an offering. May the power of the true god fill and change them.
You will not stop us. The Order of the Black Worm will consume all in its path.
By your crimes, you have been permanently expelled from the Fighters Guild. You have no further chance to atone for your actions.
All guild members have been instructed to deny you service, shelter, and assistance. From now until your death, you do not exist in our eyes.
You've brought back the horns. Your rank and responsibilities are restored. There will be no further chances given you.
Don't speak to me again, unless you've gotten twenty minotaur horns. Then, perhaps we'll have something to discuss.
You've killed another of your brothers! During other times, I'd have you killed for this. One chance. Bring me twenty minotaur horns.
Perhaps this exercise will help you build character, or vent your murderous rage elsewhere. Or, you'll die, and you won't be our problem. Now, go.
First a theft, and now a murder. Your crimes are escalating. You have one final chance. Go out and collect the horns of twenty minotaurs.
If you succeed, perhaps you'll have learned something in that time. If you fail, perhaps you'll be dead, and no longer our problem. Now, go.
Another theft! This is your final chance. Go back into the field, and return to me with the horns of twenty minotaurs.
If you return, perhaps you'll have gained some measure of character. Perhaps, though, you'll die. Then you're no longer the guild's problem.
First you murder, now you steal? Have you gone mad? You're a disgrace. I will offer you one final chance.
Return with 20 minotaur horns if you wish to rejoin the Fighters Guild. Perhaps you'll find redemption; perhaps you'll die trying. Go now.
So, you've collected the pelts. I trust you've learned a lesson. Your rank is restored, along with all rights and responsibilities.
You've been told what you must do in order to regain your standing, and you've not yet done it. Don't return until you have twenty bear pelts.
You've murdered one of your brothers. While we may die in battle, we do not expect to die at the hands of our friends.
I offer you a chance for redemption. Do not return until you have 20 bear pelts. Take this time to come to terms with what you've done.
You would steal from your brothers? If you had a need for something, why would you not just ask? I will give you a chance, though.
As it is only your first offense, do not return until you have collected 20 bear pelts. Use this time to reflect on your actions.
The Order of the Black Worm will feast on your soul, mortal.
How about you just keep walking?
Welcome to the Arcane University.
You need to take care of you problems with the guild before we can talk.
Are you ready for one last great heist?
Have you decided?
You have the scroll? I can hardly believe it! The odds were clearly against you. Capital job! Capital!
I have spent seven years learning how to translate this scroll. Even so, I will need a while to decipher what I have sought so desperately.
You don't have the scroll? Then we have nothing to talk about.
You should be on your way by now.
The Gray Cowl is now yours. You are the new guildmaster of the Thieves Guild.
You will find that history has been altered tonight. Such is the power of Nocturnal's curse that lifting it can alter time itself.
Hey! You aren't Celia Camoran! There's an intruder in the library! Protect the scrolls!
Contrary to your goals, you remain here with me. If you seek the recreation of the staff, then you must bring the eye and the branch.
You have the items. Contrary to all prediction. Once again, you defy the path set before you.
However, what comes next is now unclear. If you wish to confront what is to come, I shall create the Staff for you.
Inaction conflicts with your purpose. The longer you are here with me, the further the balance shifts towards your enemy.
There is no other way.
I have said all that there is to say. If you wish to continue, you must proceed to the palace.
Why do you hesitate? Is it your destiny that you fear? Or perhaps your concern is that you will die before you gain the Throne of Madness.
Time passes, and still you are here. Perhaps you do not wish to play the role that has been forced upon you?
I have been waiting for you, Your Grace. This day, as all days before and after, is well known to me. There are no surprises to Dyus of Mytheria.
Sheogorath has fallen and you seek the means to foil the machinations of the Prince of Order. You seek the Throne of Madness.
However, no mortal may sit upon the throne without the staff. So here you are in my prison, seeking to supplant the one who placed me here.
If you wish to take the place of Sheogorath, then ask me what you will.
Yes, Inquisitor? What may I do for you?
What brings you to this delightful corner of the House of Dementia? How may I help you?
What do you want, Slop Drudge?
You look like one of the low lifes that infest this place.
I'm busy now. You need to talk to Methredhel.
If you aren't going to tell me where to find the Gray Fox, I'm not interested.
Have you been to the Dark Fissure yet? We need to know all we can about the Necromancers.
Bothiel may know more about this "Shade of the Revenant" referred to in the book you've given me. Speak with her.
Has Tar-Meena been of use in gathering information about the Necromancers?
Good work at Vahtacen. Jarol is quite pleased with the information now coming in about the site.
There is another predicament which I believe you can also help resolve, if you feel ready for it.
What's this, some sort of Ayleid artifact?
Well, well. Raminus was right in sending you out there. Good work. I'll be sure and put in a good word for you.
Well, would you look at that!
Someone will need to see where this goes. I think you should go; you've done all the hard work, after all.
If there are any discoveries to be made, you should be the one to make them. You deserve that much.
I'm really impressed. You made getting past that pillar look easy.
Sent you in to try your hand at the thing, have they?
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.
Get yourself to Vahtacen, and see if you can help Skaleel with whatever is holding up her progress.
Here about Vahtacen, are you?
It's a damned shame. I haven't been giving the project the attention it deserves.
The last report I received from Skaleel indicated there was some sort of problem. A blocked passage, or something, that they couldn't get past.
I'd investigate it further, but I'm needed here with the Council. Raminus says you've got a good head on your shoulders.
Look into it for me, will you? You can find Skaleel at the site. Access is restricted, so you'll need this key.
You should be helping Irlav Jarol, shouldn't you?
I have a new task for you, and I assure you there are no Necromancers involved.
Not now, you fool!
It is ill-advised for us to speak.
You'll be happy to know that Erthor is back in town.
He knows to tell Adrienne that you're the one who rescued him. You should be able to tell her you've completed her little task.
And let's just keep this little deal between us, shall we?
We'll talk more once I've finished getting Erthor back. For now, I have work to do.
I hear you got quite a task from Adrienne.
Hello, Associate. It seems you've obtained the final recommendation you required.
You sleep rather soundly for a murderer. That's good. You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose.
I have nothing more to say. We shall speak again only after Rufio lies dead.
So, the deed is done. How do I know this? You will find that the Dark Brotherhood knows a great many things. For you are now part of the family.
I am done with you for now. Go to the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in Cheydinhal and speak with Ocheeva. She will provide further instruction.
It's... It's finally over. The killer is dead. We just... We just need to get out of here...
So, you finally showed up. It's about time. People of my station are not accustomed to waiting.
I was just beginning to think I had something in common with the other guests. And then you showed up.
Well, here we all are. It's funny how money can bring people together, don't you think?
So, are you ready to search for the chest of gold? I'm confident I'll find it. Not that I need the money, of course. My family is quite wealthy.
Get away from me, peasant. Someone has been murdered, and I'm rather unnerved by the whole thing.
Did you hear? Someone has been murdered! One of us! One of the guests!
I'm beginning to get a bad feeling about all of this. I'd leave right now, if I could. The money means nothing to me. I just thought it would be fun.
Two people are dead, and for all I know you could have killed them! Just leave me alone, you worthless peasant!
Two people are now dead. And for what? A trunk full of coins? How pathetic.
Dear friend, have you heard? Two of the guests now lie dead! If I find out who did it, I may have to take matters into my own hands.
You... you're still alive... For all I know, you're the killer! You stand your ground, or so help me they'll be blood between us.
Three people now dead, and yet the two of us still live. Do you think I'm the killer? Because I most certainly wonder the same thing about you.
Dear friend, three of the guests have been killed! You and I, we must stay close. Band together, for mutual protection!
You... you murdering dog! How could you have killed all those people? For the gold, is that it? You filthy peasant!
I... I don't understand. You're the only one left. Why weren't you killed? No... no... it can't be...
Listen to me! The others, they're all dead! Someone has been coming in here and killing them! That means there must be a way out!
Greetings. How may I help you? Are you perhaps interested in joining the Fighters Guild?
Good work, good pay. Want to join the Guild?
Greetings. I see you've been keeping yourself busy. This is good. I believe it's time for you to perform some duties for your Guild.
My friend! What can I do for you?
I've told you what we need. Until we've work, we'll stay here.
It's not wise to interrupt us in the middle of our discussion.
We should get back to Oreyn and report what we have found.
We must find Galtus Previa. He must be here somewhere.
Let us be on our way.
Greetings, guildmate. What can I do for you?
Why has the Cheydinhal Sanctuary not yet been Purified? Everyone based out of that location must die. Only then will the Black Hand be satisfied.
The ritual of Purification is complete. Well done. Sithis has been appeased, and the time has come to acknowledge and reward your unwavering loyalty.
The Black Hand is most pleased with your progress. You have been invited to share in secrets that few within the Dark Brotherhood even know exist.
Your life in the Sanctuary is over. Those contracts are behind you. Now, you will serve the Black Hand. You will serve me.
From this moment forward, you will walk the shadows as my Silencer. You will receive contracts only from me. Your new life has begun.
I have been waiting for you, assassin. We have not spoken in some time, but I am well aware of your accomplishments within the Dark Brotherhood.
That is why I have sent for you. I'm afraid there is a... situation. The time has come to test both your skill and your loyalty to Sithis.
The Black Hand has learned that the Dark Brotherhood has been infiltrated. By whom, and for what purpose, we do not yet know.
What we do know is that there is some link between the traitor and the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. The traitor has tainted that place beyond repair.
It was learned that the traitor has been active for quite some time, since before you joined the Brotherhood. That absolves you of any suspicion.
Do we know each other? There's something familiar about you, but I just can't place it.
You have your task. Find Delmar, and ask for his help.
What? Necromancers at the cave?
You should be out acquiring a Mage's Staff for yourself. What do you need?
We come to the real work at last.
You have, no doubt, seen some of the worst the guild has to offer. As much as we try to hold mages to a higher standard, they are only human.
What I hope you will now see is that while the guild can be disjointed and misused, it can also achieve some wonderful things.
Now you have an opportunity to engage in more meaningful tasks, and continue with your advancement through the guild.
Have you been to Skingrad, and seen Count Hassildor?
I've said all there is to be said. Trouble me no more.
You impossible fool. What possessed you to think I would suggest a meeting here, of all places?
At least your gullibility served some useful purpose. I knew about Mercator, but not his friends. Now none of them are a threat any longer.
Just in time, Mage. We've been waiting for you.
I'm afraid I misled you. The Count won't be arriving - in fact, he doesn't even know you're here.
We're not about to let the Guild interfere with our plans, for the Count or otherwise.
So, you'll have to die. Don't worry. We'll put your body to good use, I assure you.
Well, well. You're late, Mage.
Well, well. You're early, Mage.
I've told you all you need to know. Follow the road west out of town and through the High Pasture; the Count will meet you there at 2 AM.
You there. I have an update for you.
The Count has agreed to see you, but not here.
He wishes to meet with you north of the Cursed Mine outside of town, after 2 AM.
It would be wise of you to be on time.
Follow the road west out of Skingrad, through the High Pasture. The mine entrance is south of the road. The Count will meet you just outside it.
Has a day passed yet? No?
Then, as I told you, I don't have any new information for you, do I?
Yes? The Mages Guild, you say?
Oh, the Count is quite aware of your presence here. He simply has no interest in granting you an audience at this time.
Now that I've seen you myself, I can't say that I blame him.
Nevertheless, I shall endeavor to change his mind on the subject. Return tomorrow - perhaps he will see you then.
You have your task. Perform it as well as you would any other.
I have a new task for you.
I think that'll be all of them. Can't imagine more in this area. You can go tell Arvena this is all taken care of. Good hunting.
If they're out here, they'll be in this area. I can't imagine there are more than four of them. Let's take care of this.
Let's see if we can't find those mountain lions.
What is it you want? You were told to stay out of my sight. I'll assume you're here to tender a resignation.
There are more around. Look in the houses.
Let's go, rookie. Drink up and we'll head out.
I think someone is watching me. I see figures in the shadows all the time.
I know it's all in my head. I'm spending too much time on my latest project. But enough about me. What can I do for you?
My poor husband is getting no sleep. He's awake all night taking care of those stupid plants.
You return to me, yet you bear no news? Go, Silencer, uncover the identity of the traitor! The fate of the Dark Brotherhood rests in your hands!
Greetings, Speaker.
No! No, I'm too late! I thought I could get here in time, thought I could stop you!
By Sithis, what have you done? What madness has claimed you? You have betrayed me, you have betrayed the Dark Brotherhood! Why?
I am here to end your miserable life, to... But... I can see the confusion in your eyes. You... You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Oh! Hello, there. I'm sorry, you startled me. My nerves get rattled rather easily these days, I'm afraid. Living alone will do that to you.
Now, is there something I can help you with?
Oh, back again? I don't know what else you could need. I gave you the list. That  should tell you where you can find my children, and what they want.
Now please, make sure my gifts get to the children. I'm counting on you!
Looking for a room?
Not now. First we have to see about Myvryna.
What do you want? Can't you see I'm in the middle of an investigation?
Unless you have word of the Gray Fox, my time is limited.
You're not supposed to be down here.
What have we here? A visitor?
I'm afraid you've missed the party. The guest of honor has already left.
You won't be leaving, though. I'll see to that now.
I'm just doing my job. You got a problem with it, you go talk to Eridor.
So, the work is complete. Now we can discuss the information I have for you.
You make progress, but your work is not yet done.
Welcome, guild mage. We meet again, although in different circumstances.
I fear this time you may find the results no more to your liking than the last. Less so, perhaps.
The information I have for your guild will not be met with smiles and hand-shakes, I fear.
Let us speak of the information I have for your guild, so that you may pass it on to your Council, and they may decide how to use it.
You continue to do the guild proud. As such, a new task awaits you.
This time, however, it comes from Arch-Mage Traven himself. You should go see him.
Listener! I am a new initiate to the Dark Brotherhood, just a lowly Murderer, but if there's any way I can serve you, any way at all, I am yours!
Arch-Mage! You have returned!
Mannimarco has been defeated? I can hardly believe it! The King of Worms is no more!
I... I received a note from Arch-Mage Traven. I know what he did for us, and that he selected you to take his place.
I will mourn for him during my own, private time. For now, I cannot help but rejoice. You have brought safety to the guild, and I thank you.
I have already sent word to all the local guild halls that you are now in charge. Congratulations, Arch-Mage.
Do I know you?
You're bothering me.
I hear the monks were most... hospitable.
I see you got my message.
Don't you have something to do?
He's inside, downstairs. Don't keep him waiting.
I have need of your services once more.
I have been waiting.
Aren't you supposed to be on a quest for the Gray Fox?
Come. We have much to discuss.
I assume you found Springheel Jak's tomb.
Not now. I need to think.
Please don't harm me! What is it you want?
Life is a blessing, and death is not the end, but only when the spirit remains incorruptible.
I have seen everything. After you've seen through Vaermina's eyes, nothing can frighten you.
Hold on there! There'll be no sneaking into the Countess' dinner party. Allow me to escort you out of here.
Hold on. There's a dinner party here tonight, and no one gets in the room until it's prepared.
And no one gets in the room even after it's prepared, unless they're on the list. And even if they're on the list, they'd better be dressed for it.
This is important to the Countess, and no one is going to muck it up. Got it?
What're you doing here? You don't look like one of the party guests. I don't remember you on the list.
No... you're dead! I killed you myself! What manner of creature are you? Will I be tormented with your image forever?
I have sworn not to raise a weapon in anger, but you have offended my honor in this most holy place. Prepare to die, devil.
I will not fight you, friend. I have taken a vow. My gods will protect me.
I would ask that you not bother me, especially in this place.
I would prefer you leave, friend. Please.
Go to his shrine. See what lies ahead.
You are summoned by the Lord Hermaeus Mora. He sees your path as he sees all things. Make your way to his shrine.
Between the seen and unseen, the seeming and the being, lies the gulf of ignorance.
You have your orders, Silencer. Ask of me what you will, and then make haste to Hero Hill. Your first dead drop contract awaits.
Don't go back in there. I'm warning you. You'll end up like the others.
Did you hear that? Did you? Voices from nowhere, madmen... where does it end? How did I get this posting?
I still say steer clear of that door. Nothing good to be found on the other side of it. Of that, I'm certain.
Can't talk now. That door has been making noises again. No telling what's coming out.
I'd stay back from that door if I were you. Nothing that's gone in has come out right.
You wear our robes, but I hear the darkness that you bring in your very breath. You do not know harmony... you do not see my light.
You come to me glowing with violence and death. Your light has no place here. We seek harmony for ourselves and the Shivering Isles.
How dare you interrupt me!
Ciirta is dead, and Ra'kheran has fallen. Who will guide us now?
Ciirta is dead. Ra'kheran will guide us now.
Hrmph... it seems that I made a miscalculation. Against all odds and all the knowledge that I possess, a new Sheogorath is risen.
How I loathe the idea of personal choice. It makes things so... imprecise.
However, you shall still fall victim to the same pitfalls as he. Leave me to my torment, Madgod. Leave me to suffer as Sheogorath before you.
Yes, Lord Sheogorath? Why do you disturb me?
Lord Sheogorath... as I expected. I will hear you and then ask for peace from your prattle.
Say what you will, receive your answers, and leave me to my solitude.
Stay away from me. You've already spent too much time... over there.
When we're done with all this, we'll talk. If we're still alive...
Not now. There's work to be done.
Now's not the time for talking.
Lead the way. I'm right behind you.
We saw the smoke from the Gold Road while out on patrol. How can we help?
If Captain Matius is waiting on you to get that gate raised, you'd better get moving.
I'm going to head back and meet up with the rest of the troops.
This is it. The entrance to the passage is right here. I'll unlock it for you.
Best of luck.
Come on, we've got to keep moving!
I'm just waiting for Captain Matius to give the order. Finally, a chance to fight back!
Do you have the Count's ring?
Where is the Count? Why is he not with you?
All right, this is it!
We'll hold this area. You head to the back of the castle, and find the Count.
Don't come back here without him!
You need to find the Count! Get moving!
This area's clear. We've got to get inside and find the Count before it's too late. Move out!
Charge the courtyard! Leave none of them standing!
Get moving! We can't do a thing until you get those gates opened!
Dammit, this is no good!
The gates are locked, and the only way to open them is from within the gatehouse.
We've got to make it to the castle!
Are you ready to go? We need your help getting to the castle, but we need to move soon.
We've done good work, but this is no time to start patting each other on the back. There's still much to do.
We need to get to the castle. That's where Count Goldwine and his men should be. Last I saw, they were trying to fortify the castle from an attack.
If the Count is still alive, it's my duty to assist him, even if it means giving up my life. If you're with me, we need to get going.
Are you injured, Lord? Do you require my services?
So I wanted somebody murdered! So I prayed to the Night Mother! What, is that a crime now? They even took my house, those bastards! Agghhh!
Come on! We can use your help to drive back the invaders!
If you know how to close that Gate, be my guest. My orders are to hold this position, and that's what I intend to do.
Thanks for the help, friend. I didn't recognize you at first, but you're the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?
It was a privilege to fight by your side.
Thanks for the help. As soon as my lieutenant gets back, we'll be moving out.
We were ordered out to attack the daedra coming out of that Oblivion Gate. Captain's the only one who ever knows what's going on.
You went inside that Gate, huh? You saved our necks, so thanks.
I was afraid we were gonna be ordered in there. Legion always ends up doing everybody's dirty work.
Move along, citizen. There's nothing to be done here.
I'm sorry, no one except for Cheydinhal City Guard are allowed inside this home.
Due to outstanding fines owed to the city, Aldos Othran's property has been seized and is now sealed until further notice. Good day.
Yes? What news are you bringing me?
After speaking to the Count and reviewing your testimony, we decided to reduce Llevana's sentence as she was acting for self-preservation.
I've been promoted to the post of Captain of the Guard, and hope to return respect to the peacekeepers of this town.
The Count and I thank you for helping bring Ulrich's hold on Cheydinhal to an end, though we would have preferred having him brought up on charges.
As a token of our gratitude, as you did this at the risk of false imprisonment or perhaps your life, we reward you this bounty of gold.
On behalf of the people of Cheydinhal, I thank you.
After speaking to the Count, and in light of the evidence you recovered, Ulrich has been removed from his post and arrested.
Many guards are coming forward with more evidence of his greed, so it's safe to say he'll been spending quite a bit of time in the city dungeons.
The Count and I thank you for helping bring Ulrich's hold on Cheydinhal to an end, and for doing so without unnecessary bloodshed.
Like I said... meet me in two hours at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn.
You're back, good. Did you find the evidence?
We must put an end to this travesty of justice.
Have you discovered anything new?
I'm sorry, there's nothing else you can assist with at this point.
I see from your expression that you have grave news.
You're back! What happened?
What brings you to me this day?
I see from your expression that you were successful.
No time to talk now, you must hurry to Boreal Stone Cave!
Just before I arrived here, I received a report from one of our scouts watching the roads.
Raynil was spotted heading west out of Bruma. The scout tried to follow, but lost him in the mountains.
The only cave to the west that comes close to the one described in Gelebourne's journal is Boreal Stone Cave. That must be where he's headed.
You must get there before he acquires whatever artifact is being kept there and makes his escape.
I'm keeping the city guard in Bruma, as Raynil doesn't know we're after him. If he sees a guard, he may panic and run.
You're my only hope at the moment. Please, you have my authorization to do everything you can to bring him to justice.
If he won't surrender, I think you know what to do. Hurry, I fear you have a day at the most to stop him.
I must go and tell the guard. Please, meet me at Olav's in one hour.
So, any new revelations in your... errr.... investigation?
I'm going to make arrangements for removal of the bodies and then I'll probably stay on guard here for a bit.
We're afraid there may be retribution on Bradon's wife even though she had nothing to do with it. Vampires are a hated lot.
You're going to have to leave. This is a crime scene and no one other than ourselves or Raynil Dralas will be allowed access.
Sorry, I have a lot of work to do.
This area is off limits to anyone except the Bruma City Watch.
Hello. I'm not really in the mood to chat right now.
It is quite nice to see you again. I hope you are faring well.
Ahhh! You have returned from your investigation, and I am eager to hear the results.
Whom did you accuse?
I hope the investigation goes well. Return to me when you have found the culprit.
Good to see you again. Have you reconsidered your decision to undertake the investigation?
It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Countess Valga of Chorrol. I wish I had time to chat, but I'm afraid I am in the middle of an investigation.
Hello. I am Laythe Wavrick, the Chief Herald and Countess Valga's attendant. Welcome to Chorrol.
A pleasure to meet you again.
Quickly, quickly! There's no time!
You must get to the top of the large tower. The Sigil Keep, they call it. That's what keeps the Oblivion Gate open!
Find the Sigil Stone. Remove it, and the Gate will close! Hurry! The Keeper has the key-- you must get the key!
Take the key. Get to the Sigil Keep, and find the Sigil Stone. It's the only way.
Don't worry about me; there's no time! Get moving!
Have you got the key? You must get the Keeper's key -- it's the only way into the Sigil Keep!
Get out of here! There's no time for this!
Thank the Nine! I never thought I'd see another friendly face...
The others... taken... they were taken to the tower!
This just keeps getting better and better. What do you want me to do?
What's the plan?
How did you get in here? What are you doing here?
I knew Captain Matius would get us through this. He'd be up for a commendation, if anyone were left to issue it.
I didn't expect any of us to live this long. Maybe we're not doomed, after all.
Don't talk - fight!
The city's in flames, and we've got nothing but a bunch of greenhorns. I doubt the situation could be much worse.
Talk to Captain Matius if you need something. I'm just following his orders.
Just follow Savlian's orders, and everything will be fine.
Ha ha! We wiped the bastards out!
It's safe to pull those people out of the chapel. Let's get in there and make sure they're all right.
Come on. This is only the beginning of the battle for Kvatch. We can discuss the next phase once the civilians are safe.
Let's get inside the chapel and make sure those folks are all right. If there are injuries, they'll need to be tended to right away.
We've done it! I can't believe it -- I didn't really think this would work. Maybe we do have a fighting chance.
Oh, yes. We're not done. Not even close. This was only the first step. If this town is to be ours again, we'll need to get inside the castle.
You've come this far with us; will you go further? If we're truly going to succeed, I'll need much more of your help.
I warn you though, what we've seen so far is nothing compared to the battle that likely awaits us.
Take a few moments to catch your breath and think it over. When you're ready, let me know, and we'll get underway.
We've got to clear this area so we can pull those people out of the chapel! Kill anything that moves!
Follow me! For Kvatch!
You closed the Gate? I knew you could do it! This is our chance to launch a counterattack!
I need you to come with us. You've got far more combat experience than these men.
Are you able to join us now? I can wait, but not for long. We've got to move quickly, before they have a chance to barricade the city gate.
Are you ready? We need to move out soon, while we still have a chance to strike.
Until you find a way to close that Oblivion Gate, there's nothing I can do but try to hold our position here as long as I can.
Have you changed your mind? I don't think they've barricaded the gates yet, so we still have a chance to attack the city.
While that infernal Oblivion Gate still stands, I don't dare leave the camp undefended. Are you willing to try and close it?
Stand back, civilian!
This is no place for you. Get back to the encampment at once!
You'd best get back to the encampment. There's no telling when more of them will come out of that infernal Oblivion Gate.
Hello. I hope the goblins along the Yellow Road didn't give you any trouble.
If you need anything, talk to my father-in-law. This whole expedition was his idea.
What are you doing? We can't talk in front of him!
You came. Good. I don't have much time. I have to get to the Gathering before I'm missed.
I can't be seen talking to you. I've done what I can. Now it's up to you.
Let me give you some advice, stranger.  Leave.  Now.  You ain't welcome here.
You're not welcome around here.
We don't like strangers poking their noses into our business.
If you're not careful, the brethren will have to teach you a lesson.
A little bird told me that you've been asking around town about Glarthir. Our resident "eccentric." I'd like to know why.
I've nothing more to say to you.
I've already surrendered. What more do you want?
How'd you get in here?
Incredible, we've been trying to solve this for months. A job well done.
Say, you look like someone that could help us out. Having a bit of trouble with another merchant in town who goes by the name Thoronir.
Are you still trying to file a complaint against Audens Avidius? I thought I told you to take it up with Itius Hayn.
If you are still trying to file a complaint against Audens Avidius, go see Itius Hayn. I can't help you.
Can I help you Citizen?
I've just been arrested for corruption, so I'm not in the mood to talk.
Someday I'll get out of here and take my revenge on everyone that put me in prison.
You're back! And Antus is with you.... thank you for bringing him home safely.
But where is Rallus? I don't see him...  oh, please tell me I haven't lost one of my sons.
You're back! And Rallus is with you.... but where is Antus? I don't see him.
You're back! And you've brought my sons with you! How wonderful!
Rallus and Antus need your help, whether they know it or not. There's no time to waste.
Have you talked to my sons yet? I don't want them leaving on their own.
Have you changed your mind? My sons could use your help in their fight.
My sons! Have you seen my sons?
Let's go see my father, and let him know of our victory!
I think... I think we got them all. We're safe, for now. We'd best return to town while we can.
This is no time to talk! Keep your guard up, and watch your back! We've got to kill all of them!
It's just this way.
I'm afraid I have no time for small talk, friend. I'm waiting for my father, Valus Odiil. Have you seen him in town, by any chance?
I have no time to talk, friend. As soon as my father arrives, we head back to the farm. These creatures must be dealt with.
Ha ha! We beat them! We slaughtered them all! Did you see? Did you see how well I fought?
But.... oh, no. Poor Rallus.
Why didn't you help him? You could've saved him!
You'll have to tell father what you've done.
Did we get them all?... Are there more?
Don't talk to me now! Kill the filthy creatures!
We can't keep stopping to talk like this! We've got to get out there and fight!
Why isn't father here? He knows how important this is!
I don't have time to talk to you! There's fighting to be done! When my father arrives, we're going back to the forest!
Thank you for getting me out of that cursed place. 'Tis ashame Farwil didn't make it. At least he died doing what he loved.
Thank you for getting me out of that cursed place.
Ah! Cheydinhal... it's good to see its walls again.
All this, and now Farwil is dead. Oblivion is truly cursed. Make sure you take his signet ring to bring to the Count. He would want proof.
Even if Farwil doesn't say it, we appreciate that you're here.
It's good to see a friendly face. I feared we'd never see anyone from Cyrodiil again.
I know you must have many questions... speak with Farwil and he'll answer them for you.
I'm sorry, I have to patrol the area... but you should hurry to Castle Cheydinhal. The Count doesn't like to be kept waiting.
You've done it! But what of Farwil?
You've done it! I never thought it possible!
I suppose Farwil will wish to talk to you now. Musn't keep the Count's son waiting.
You're a brave soul to attempt entry to Oblivion. Hopefully, your skill matches your fortitude.
Be glad to answer any other questions. Just keep your voice down, who knows what could slip out of that gate at any moment.
I'd advise you to keep your distance from that accursed portal.
Good work closing the Oblivion Gate, you've made my job much easier and safer. Thanks!
If you're looking for Amminus, he's resting in the Knights Lodge over there.
Please speak to Amminus. He can tell you what you need to know.
Amminus can answer any questions you may have. He should be resting in the Knights of the Thorn Lodge over yonder.
Have you recovered the Madstone?
I'm pleased you decided to find the Madstone. It will be the highlight of my collection.
Back to take me up on that offer, eh? I knew you couldn't resist.
I've heard much about your deeds from my people in Bruma.
I trust that the stipend Tolgan gave you whetted your appetite?
Hear me out before you make your decision.
I think I know why you're here, but I'd speak to my herald, Tolgan, first. I believe he has something for you. Then return to me.
Welcome to Bruma Castle. What's brought you here today?
You have made a long and perilous journey, but there is no time to rest.
The Army of Reman is at our doorstep, and our supplies have dwindled.
We have awaited your arrival. Tell us, what news do you bring from Akavir?
I'm sorry for running away like that, but fear got the best of me.
I'm glad you talked me into coming with you. Now that the curse has been lifted, I feel like I've taken care of my family's unfinished business.
Excellent work, my friend. May the manor give you many years of happiness. I'm now off to the Imperial City once more. Farewell!
I'm pleased we were able to get that secret door open, but I fear I can no longer assist you here. I'll wait for you at The Count's Arms.
Not much more I can do to help you.
Okay, you lead from here. Hopefully we can make it to the basement without too much fighting.
Lead on.
Did you want to continue to the manor?
I was half expecting you not to show up. Are you ready to go to the manor?
Are you ready to go to the manor?
As I said, I'll meet you back in Anvil as soon as I can. I won't be traveling with you as I'm making my own arrangements.
I'm surprised to see you all the way out here in the Imperial City.
You're a persistent one.
You got quite a deal on that house.
That manor is still for sale if you're interested.
Hello, I am Velwyn Benirus. If you're in the market, I'm selling a manor house right now for a very good price.
You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home would you? If you are, I just happen to be selling a manor located right here in Anvil.
Release! Sweet Release! After all these years, these decades, I am finally free! And you! So... so fresh! I must feed! I must feed! Agghhhhh!
I see you took us up on our offer. Good. I'm glad to see you. Signy will be along shortly. I'm sure we can find something to do while we wait.
Now we can't have you standing there all uncomfortable in all those clothes. Why don't you take everything off and place it there on the table.
I see you decided to take us up on our offer. Good. We could use another gal in the gang.
Here's how it works. We case The Flowing Bowl for a likely subject. Namely, we look for a married guy who drinks a lot.
Then we'll send you in there where you charm the man and get him to come out to some location we pick to rob him.
When he gets there, we make him take off all his clothes, which is very easy by the way. While they're helpless, that's when we spring the trap.
So far, we haven't had to draw one drop of blood. The best part of the whole thing is that the men are so embarrassed, they won't tell the guards!
So, the bottom line is, you show a little skin... just a tease. No one touches you. What do you say?
See you at eleven. I hope.
Can't wait to see you later. Don't keep us waiting.
Never seen you here before.
You look like you can handle yourself in a fight. And I'm sure you wouldn't mind making a little extra money. Hmmmm...
I've put together a, well... a gang. We make money by luring fools out to the middle of nowhere and robbing them blind.
Our targets? Weak willed men who are easily fooled into believing they will have their way with us. Hahaha... men are so gullible.
I leave the decision up to you. If you want to join up, meet us at the Gweden farmhouse around 11 in the evening. I'll mark it on your map.
Oh, and one more thing, if you breathe a word of this to the city guard, you won't live long enough to get whatever reward they're offering.
Signy wants to talk to you. I think you'll like what she has to say.
It is good to see you again, my friend.
I cannot thank you enough for helping me rescue Rona from the terrible state she was in. I hope that she has found the peace she sought.
I'd like to offer you a reward for your efforts.
Please, go.
My wife... my beautiful wife.
Now is not the time for discussion. Give me a day's time to set her affairs in order. Speak with Hai-Liurz tomorrow.
Please, leave me to my grief.
Time grows short. The cure must be administered as soon as possible. Please, hand it over.
Melisande has agreed to help revive Rona long enough for her to drink the potion, and finally be at peace.
If you are quiet, you may remain. Now, stand aside.
I understand you're looking for a cure for vampirism.
This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.
I don't see any scamps, or the staff!
You must be rid of the staff, or the scamps will follow you around forever!
I can't thank you enough for doing this for me.
Are you ready to accept the staff?
I was afraid you wouldn't come back.
Please, don't dawdle here... get to the Mages Guild! Hurry!
I'm at my wit's end! I beg you to help me!
These stupid scamps are driving me crazy!
Well go get it! What good is it doing if you're standing here?
If you try and cross me, I'll tell the town guard.
So, were you able to find out about the gold or not?
Did you pry any information out of him?
Until you get some information from Jorundr, I don't have anything else to tell you.
I knew the lure of gold couldn't keep you away long.
Can't you see that I'm upset?
I'm here for Jorundr's gold, and you're my only loose end. I'd been hoping to get someone in his cell and loosen his lips, and then you showed up.
You really should be more careful when you talk in the dungeons... the sound tends to carry. Jorundr's such an idiot.
I've taken care of Arnora, she won't be around to point the finger. And Jorundr's not going anywhere for a long time. That just leaves you...
I don't talk to inmates. Now shut up, and don't bother me.
I hope you are here to tell me of Black Brugo's death.
I guarantee generous rewards to those adventurers who serve County Leyawiin.
I hope you've been successful?
Marius Caro, by grace of the Nine, Count Leyawiin. You are a stranger to me, but well-met.
Perhaps you would like to do a service for County Leyawiin?
How are you faring in your campaign against the remnants of the Black Bow Bandits, Sir Knight?
Kvatch was rebuilt from ruins once before and she'll do it again. You have my thanks.
Enjoy the manor. It suits you well.
Great... nice work. Now that he's dead, we'll never find the treasure. Just get away from me.
I'm far too busy to speak to you right now.
As always, you're a welcome sight.
What's wrong with you? Farwil may have been a pain in the rear, but that was no reason to slay him!
How good to see you again, fellow knight.
Are you mad? You killed Farwil, and now you casually speak to me as if nothing's happened? Begone from my sight before I kill you where you stand!
Be happy to help you.
So nice of you to drop by again and see me.
Hello again. I'm sorry, but I have little time to chat. I am quite busy with affairs of state and all that.
It is quite nice to see you again. I hope you are fairing well.
Sorry, I must check in at Leyawiin Castle. Excuse me.
Any luck taking down Lonavo?
Hmmm. Perhaps you'll be able to assist me. I'm after some skooma dealers.
How can I assist you today?
No talking. And, by the way, we execute escaping prisoners. Just a friendly reminder.
Crime doesn't pay. We have long memories. We won't forget.
Crime don't pay. My cells is full of fools thinkin' it did. I might just sees ya there soon.
What can I do fer ya, sir?
Morning, sir.
Morning, ma'am.
What can I do fer ya, ma'am?
Visitors ain't allowed down heres.
You're new here in Skingrad? Fine. I'll make sure the captain knows we have a stranger in town.
Please keep your weapons sheathed, and use your best manners.
We're a bit suspicious of strangers here. Don't give us anything to be suspicious about, will you, please?
Welcome to Anvil. If you need a guard, just look around.
That's why things are so peaceful here. Just look around... and there's a town guard. Prevents all sorts of misunderstandings.

What do you need?
Is there a problem.
We're here to serve.
We're always on duty.
What seems to be the problem?
We're here to help.
Duty calls.
Is there a problem, citizen?
Something I can help you with?
Protect and serve. It's what we do.
Something to report?
Sir?
Ma'am?
Best not to talk about it here. Meet me after dark at the sewer grate northeast of the Sheogorath statue.
I have a proposition for you. Best not to talk about it here. Meet me at the sewer grate northeast of the Sheogorath statue.
Come after dark. Come alone.
Sometimes I come up here to think. Everything looks so small from up here. Makes me feel better, you know? Like I'm not so small myself.
But that feeling only lasts a little while. Then I start thinking about how miserable everything is, and then all I want to do is step off the ledge.
I can't just jump. Don't want to end up on the Hill. But I hope that someday maybe a big gust of wind will come and push me off so I can end it all.
I often wonder what it'd be like, to fall to the ground so far below. I bet it'd be like flying -- then suddenly falling into a deep, blissful sleep.
Look, I'll find someone else to help me. Leave me alone.
Okay, I'm going to pretend everything is normal. Make your move as soon as you can. But, let me get away first. Don't let me see it coming.
I don't want to see it coming. Take me unaware. And, for your own good, it should probably look like an accident.
Put that torch away. Do you want people to see us talking?
Ah, I'm glad you came. So, are you interested in earning some loot?
My betrothed! I must save her!
Please! I must find my betrothed!
My betrothed is gone! I cannot live without her. I only hope I can take a Fanatic with me.
The invaders are breaking through! I danced for the rain, but it isn't helping.
Stand back! They're going to breach the gate any minute now!
Don't stand too close. I need room to swing my weapon.
We're doomed, doomed I tell you!
I'm a farmer, not a soldier! I don't know how to use this weapon.
I sat here and feasted while others fought. Thus I earned my doom.
I went about my business while others fought. Thus I earned my doom.
I used my piety to avoid joining the defense. Thus I earned my doom.
Hieronymus Lex, Officer of the Watch. Every hand is needed to build an honest city, and it begins with you.
I'm Watch Captain Audens Avidius. Don't forget it. I like this city quiet as a mouse. Raise a fuss, and you'll be sorry.
You new here? I'm Servatius Quintilius, Officer of the Watch. Just stay out of trouble, and we'll get along just fine.
I'm Adamus Phillida, prison administrator and commander of the Imperial Legion forces here in the Imperial City. Have we met? You look familiar.
What a battle, eh? I thought we were all goners until I saw that fiery dragon in the sky.
A lot of good men died. But it could have been worse. A lot worse.
But why am I telling you? You were there. You saw... him. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to sleep again.
Whatever you need, Champion.
Well met, citizen. I see few new faces these days, it seems. With the Emperor's murder, a darkness has fallen upon all of Cyrodiil.
Speak quickly! I have no time for mindless blather!
I welcome a friendly face in these dark times. How can I be of assistance?
When I speak to someone like you -- a noble citizen of the Empire -- it reminds me what I'm fighting for. I salute you!
Make it fast, dreg! What little patience I have is wearing thin....
I did not join the Imperial Legion to engage in small talk with rabble like you. If you have something to say, say it.
Hello, citizen. I hope you're faring well in these difficult times.
Hail, citizen. I speak for the Emperor. Or... at least I did...
Greetings, magister! How can I be of service?
Hail, Good Mage! Welcome to the Arcane University! Is there anything I can help you with?
Pfft. If you weren't authorized to be here I'd conjure up an Atronach to freeze your blood cold. Watch your step.
This humble Legion soldier is at your service. How can I help a fellow citizen of the Empire?
I don't see many wanderers out here in the wild. But you look like you can take of yourself.
By the gods, the snow's coming down! What brings you out here in the cold, citizen?
Well now, I didn't expect to see anyone else foolish enough to venture out here in the rain! How do you fare, citizen?
Any citizen who takes the time to talk to a member of the Legion is okay in my book. With all that's happened, it's good to know we're appreciated.
State your business, citizen.
You have a death wish, citizen? Put that weapon away. Now.
You. I've seen your kind before. You've got blood on your hands. Keep your blade sheathed, you murdering bastard, or I'll put you down myself.
Bet you think you're somethin' huh? You call yourself a citizen of the Empire? No respect for order, no respect for law. You make me sick.
Ah, it's good to see you, citizen! Oh yes, I know who you are. You've become something of a legend in these parts!
The Imperial Legion is at your disposal, citizen. What seems to be the problem?
Hail, citizen! It's not often I see another rider out here on the roads. Times being what they are.
Greetings, citizen. How can this Legion horseman be of service?
Please make it quick, citizen. My patrol awaits, and a Legion steed can't keep still for very long...
Trouble?
There's evil afoot, citizen, and I've little time for chatter. What is it?
Not bad.... Not bad at all! Okay, you've definitely got some potential. I'll teach you what I know.
That was disappointing at best. I was hoping for more from you.
Hey! What did I tell you about weapons! That's it; we're done.
So, how about it? Are you ready to fight now?
6, 12... You've just made things worse! 36! 42!
2, 3... Good that there are no more doubles. 4, 5....
6, 9... You're working for those Demented people! 7, 12... Go away!
3, 4... I sure don't like my double. 5, 6... She doesn't count right.
Counting the wrong corpses. You were a big help.
Perfect corpses to count! Finally!
I can't count my own corpse! Stay back!
There would be more corpses to count if someone would get rid of all the doubles around here.
Well, well. The Gray Fox, in person.
The new Gray Fox. The cowl suits you. Me? I am much happier without it.
Leave my husband and I alone, Gray Fox. Your presence only stirs up evil memories.
Even though you are the Gray Fox, I'm going to look the other way this time.
Guess what? I found another dead rat. Here, take this.
Ooh! I found a dead Gnarl, don't get to count those every day. Here, take this.
I got it from a dead Hunger. Those things are mean. Glad I didn't have to kill it. Here take it. It's his tongue!
Look at this. I got it from a dead bug. A really big one! This oozed out of his body -- here take it!
It's been too long since I've seen a corpse.
1, 2, 3 - hurry before I lose count - 5, 6, 7... D'oh! I just lost count.
Today would be a good day to die.
You got some Skooma, yeah? Right buddy? Pal? To share? Come on, pass the Skooma already!
Do you ever bathe?
He's not much to look at, but you won't find a better bargain in Cyrodiil. Take good care of him.
Go inside and talk to Petrine if you want to buy a horse. I can't help you.

I'm Dion, captain of the Skingrad Guard.
Danus Artellian, captain of the guard. The Count's Guard. Castle Guard. Dion's captain of the town guard. That's nothing to do with me.

My name is Lurio Maenius. I share a house with Matthias Draconis. I'm between jobs as a private guard.

I'm Kastav Kvinchal. And, if you listen to that witch of a sister of mine, Bronsila, I'm also a dog and a pig.
Yeah. Restita Statlilia. I work at the Chestnut Handy Stables. Have you seen our horses wandering around? No? Okay. It's just that they're missing.
I'm Brielus Gawey. And no, we don't sell horses. But we do eat well. The stables are owned by an Orc. And you know... Orcs and horses.
You should have heard the cheer when you came out of that monster Gate with that Siege Machine right on your heels.
We were all watching from the walls, and to be honest it was looking bad. I thought we were going to have to fight 'em street by street.
We lost a lot of good men that day. But Bruma is still standing. That's what counts.
Anyway, sorry to go on so long. I'm sure you've got things to do. Just wanted to thank you personally.
You and Captain Burd sure gave them daedra a good kick in the teeth. I wish I had been there to see it!

I'm the count, and you have no business talking to the count, right? Good. All straightened out. Off with you, then.
Surely... you must know who I am! The Count's son. Do you mind? I have no desire to be further acquainted with every visitor to Bravil.
I'm Viera Lerus, captain of the Bravil Guard.
Ita Rienus, Spells, Recharging and Training in Mysticism. And idle chatter. At your service.
I am Januarius Aurunceia, the Count's footman and boot-puller.
I am Janonia Aurunceia, chief maid-servant of Castle Leyawiin.
Silana Blandia, Healer of the Leyawiin Chapel. Bless the Nine, and all the faithful.
Kantav Cheynoslin. I am the Primate of Leywiin, and Zenithar's Advocate.
I'm sure you have many pressing affairs. I won't keep you.
I am Countess Alessia Caro, wife to Count Marius.
I think Leyawiin would be better off if we removed all the dirty Argonians such as yourself. You wouldn't have a problem with that, would you?
Welcome to Leyawiin. I am Alessia Caro, and I have the honor to be the wife of the Count, Marius Caro.
I'm Caelia Draconis, Captain of the Leyawiin Guard. I hope we will not meet in my official capacity... ha-ha.

Hello there, hello indeed! I'm Caldana Monrius. Well met!
Help me out,friend. I need some skooma. Real bad. The good stuff. You know? Been dry for days. Got some skooma for me? I pay well.
Yes, indeed... Sheogorath's palace is quite lovely this time of year. Sure, I can give you directions!
Can't be too careful. Please, friend. I'm begging you. Help me out.
Gimme the skooma! Don't hold out on me. I know you have it!
Pssst. Buddy. Gimme the skooma already. Quit playing around!
I'll do anything to suck down some sweet Skooma. Anything. You got some?
Did you know I've counted over a 954 dead rats, 137 dead Grummites, and 12 dead men? I'm Jastira Nanus, by the way. I count corpses. I'm good at it.
It's been so long since I've seen a corpse to count. Perhaps I'll have to make my own. Yep, that's what I'll have to do. Yes, can I help you?
Hello there. I'm Hirrus Clutumnus, not that it should matter to you, or anyone else for that matter. I'm worthless. I should die. Will you kill me?
Didn't think so. I'm such a puddle of dog pittle that people can't even be bothered to end my miserable existence. Oh, well. Goodbye.
Hey, can you help me? Suicide is bad. I'll just end up on the Hill. But, perhaps you can kill me? Stick me in the heart with something sharp?
Oh, the misery of being me. Someone end me! And be quick about it, please!
Really? You want to talk to me? Is this some kind of a joke? If you want to help, just end my life. Kill me. Here, now!
If this is your first time to the Museum, perhaps you would care for a tour.
I am the curator of the Museum of Oddities, Una Armina. Have we met? You look familiar...
Anyway, I'm always looking for new exhibits, so remember me when you come across anything Odd.
Hello, I'm Una Armina. Perhaps you've heard of my Museum of Oddities?
There you can view all the finest Oddities of the Realm. I'm always looking for new exhibits, so be sure to think of me when you see anything Odd!
Welcome to the Museum of Oddities! Let me know if you'd like a tour of our exhibits.
1, 2, 3. Hi, I'm Jastira Nanus... 4, 5, 6... As you can see, 7, 8, 9, 10... I'm a little busy counting at the moment... 11, 12, 13.
Um. Oh, no. I lost count. Crap. Okay. Well, what do you want?
1, 2, 3... is this important? 4, 5, 6... I'm counting... 8, 9. Oh, no. I missed 7. Speak up before I get mad!
I'm afraid I cannot follow you beyond this point, Inquisitor. My duties require me to stay within Crucible. I shall be there if you need me.
1, 3, 5, 7... my Lord! I... I don't know what to say. 8, 16, 4...
It's the Madgod Himself! My Lord! I've been keeping track of all the dead things for you. There's lots of dead things. I've counted them all!
My Lord Sheogorath! Please kill me!
My Lord? Are you aware we are suffering a Skooma shortage?
Lord Sheogorath. I'll bet your palace is always neat and tidy.
Welcome to the Museum of Oddities, Lord Sheogorath. I have collected all the wonders of your lands here.
You should come see my museum, Lord Sheogorath. I've built it just to honor you.
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm going to be much help.
Hope is gone. The Imperial line is dead.
The Covenant is broken. The Enemy has won.
Why have our gods forsaken us?
You saved my life. You brought me back from hell. I won't forget it.
Ready to test dialogue? Great! This should be my first time speaking with you.
You've already talked to me if you see this. Also, you should see generic greetings about 50% of the time instead of this greeting.
You know, I saw your fight against the Gray Prince. Nobody thought that Orc could be beat, but you showed them all! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Go away! You'll ruin everything!
Wellspring Grove is owned by the Mages Guild. You're not a member, so I'm afraid you're not supposed to be here.
What... what are you doing here? There's nothing going on. Leave me alone!
You are a welcome sight in these troubling times.
You have found Theranis and the Lost Histories of Tamriel?
Amusei sends his regards.
What can a humble Doyen do for a sly thief?
You'd better go talk to Jeanne before she really loses it.
Hello there. I hear you've been looking for me.
Please, don't be mad. We were just having some fun.
We just get tired of Jeanne lording her position over us, when she barely knows anything about magic. Every now and then, we like to trick her.
We figured it was time to move on to a new prank. This one was getting boring, anyway. So you can tell her you've found me!
You just couldn't wait, could you? So impatient...
Well, at least you took care of Jeanne's book. We'll be able to laugh over that one for weeks, I bet.
You'd better go tell her you found me. That way you, at least, can get out of here.
Oh, come on! You couldn't even follow through with getting that book from Jeanne's room? That would've been hilarious!
Well, fine. You go tell Jeanne you found me. You're the big hero. Whoopee. I'm going back to work. I was tired of being see-through, anyway.
What, you couldn't be bothered to find out what Volanaro wanted you to do?
And it would've been so much fun, too.
Well, you found me. Congratulations. Go tell Jeanne, if you must.
Oh, you're no fun at all!
It was just a harmless little prank, that's all. Why did you have to go and ruin it?
Well, I guess we'll go back to the drawing board. Fine, go tell Jeanne you found me. I was getting tired of being invisible all the time, anyway.
We're looking for fighters and adventurers. You should join up.
There are still goblins around. Can't you smell them? They're still here! Check the houses!
Drink. Drink! We need to go.
No time to talk. Attack!
I am busy. Get out. When I am ready to conduct guild business, I'll leave the door unlocked.
Ah, you are the new thief. I am your new Doyen.
You have returned?
Why does the prey approach me?
Do what you will with me. I've got nothing left.
So, I assume you're the one who's been sent to track us down. Damn stone was more trouble than it was worth.
I'm not staying here any longer. I need to get someplace safe.
Are they.... are they gone?
I was too afraid. I just couldn't move. I could hear the screaming, but I just couldn't move!
He killed them all. Just... slaughtered them.
I... I saw his face. I saw the King of Worms!
Oh! Most honorable Listener! I... I am so pleased to see you! Sorry, I don't mean to be nervous, it's just that, well... I am awed by your presence!
The esteemed cat burglar honors me.
You are a credit to the guild.
The end of all things has come! We're finished! All hope is gone!
The livestock are dead! Dead! The second sign! Look to the skies! Look to the skies!
You've seen it! You've seen the first sign! Perhaps this is the beginning of the K'Sharra!
No time to talk! I have to get rid of these rats!
Welcome to Border Watch, stranger. You are welcome here. I am Ri'bassa, shaman of our people.
The K'Sharra has come true!
Gods protect us! What is happening here?
Welcome to the Border Watch Inn. We don't get many visitors. Please feel free to stay a while.
Take a seat, or feel free to look around. We have a fine collection of cheeses here, some of the rarest in all Tamriel!
Welcome to our town, friend. The gods are always watching over Border Watch.
Welcome to Border Watch. A pleasure to see you.
Sanguine is pleased. It is reason to celebrate.
Sanguine has set you to a task. Do what you must, so we may drink to your success.
You have been told how to summon Sanguine. If you feel worthy, proceed.
I joined for the parties. And stayed for the parties. Why would I go back to work? That life is for suckers and fools.
Have you come to revel in the glory that is the Shrine of Sanguine?
All mortals will come to him. He is the Harvester of Souls.
You approach the Shrine of Hircine. Are you hunter, or are you prey?
You have followed the path set for you by the Lord Hermaeus Mora. Approach his shrine and speak with him.
You have not yet followed the path required to speak with the Lord Hermaeus Mora.
You have reneged on your bargain with Lord Clavicus. You are not welcome here.
You have pleased the Lord Clavicus. A wise decision.
Clavicus Vile has offered you a bargain. Serve him well.
You have been told the proposition: your donation for a possible audience with Clavicus Vile. The choice is yours.
You approach the Shrine of Clavicus Vile. You should not be here unless you have business with Lord Clavicus.
I don't recall inviting you into my house. Leave, quickly, or we will have a problem.
No. Go away. I'm not here.
Follow me! You are deserving to bear witness to Ciirta's destruction!
Ciirta has fallen into darkness. Ra'kheran will lead the Apostles to the light!
Ciirta is dead, and now the Apostles fear that there is no one to lead them to the light.
I should be the one who is leading, however. Do I have your support?
Have you brought to me the daggers?
Have you reconsidered my offer? Will you bring to me the daggers?
You... you do not belong here. You are a stranger!
No! You do not understand! Put away your weapons, I mean you no violence. Perhaps you can help me.
You... you do not belong here. Quickly! Put on a robe before the others see you! They will kill you on sight!
Please, I mean you no violence. Perhaps you can help me.
You can't see me. You can't see me. Neither can He. No one can see me.
If it isn't the newest member of the family. Let's get one thing straight -- the Tenets prevent me from killing you. But I don't have to like you.
I'll sell you equipment, but only because Ocheeva is making me. This family doesn't need any... outsiders.
You again? I thought I'd made it clear I'm not looking for a friend. If you're here to buy or sell something, get on with it already!
Ah, there you are! Look... I've been thinking, and... Well... I guess I just want to say I'm sorry for the way I've treated you in the past.
I mean, look at you! The things you've accomplished! You've obviously proven yourself a valuable member of this Sanctuary.
So let's start over, shall we? I know from now on, you and I are going to be great friends! Now, is there something you'd like to buy or sell?
Hey, there's my new pal! So what can I do for you? Need some items? Or maybe you're ready to unload something? Whatever you need!
You look like you've seen some travel.
May I help with any last minute preparations?
What did you learn from "Knightfall"?
I hope the book helps you find where Garridan may have fallen.
I just knew that Julienne would have more information.
I suggest you make your way to the Imperial City. Can't make money by standing here.
I'd love to have the Tears added to my collection.
Have you reconsidered?
S'Drassa of the Mages Guild, Evoker and Alchemist. And also, in his scant free time, a Trainer in Alchemy.
But... perhaps you are an adventurer? Could you assist me in acquiring something for my crystal collection?
Excuse me. Perhaps you're an adventurer? Could you assist me in acquiring something for my crystal collection?
A wise choice, perhaps, but you earned no respect for your cowardice.
J'Baasha's an adventurer... just like you.
Ayisha minds Ayisha's business. Maybe you should try this, too.
Are you here to visit me and perhaps purchase more of my Famous Potato Bread?
You have them! You have them! I can sense they're with you!
I can tell you haven't been successful yet. But keep trying!
Can you help me find my lost Jumbo Potatoes?
So, you remember S'razirr after all. This one was as good as his word. Are you?
You owe S'razirr. Will you pay?
This one still waits for what he earned. Do you have a better answer than last time we spoke?
Have you returned with a message from S'Krivva?
Until you have the message from S'Krivva, we have nothing further to say to one another.
Do you have business with me?
Did you wreck Cindanwe's place yet? You know, move her stuff around. She hates when things aren't in their place.
Uh, but we shouldn't be seen talking until the mission is accomplished!
Did you get Cindanwe's notebook? The one with all our secrets in it?
We shouldn't be seen talking until the mission is accomplished!
Have you accomplished the mission?
Perhaps you could help us? But why should I trust you? You might be, you know... one of Them.
Our situation is desperate, she controls our minds... but wait, I've said too much.
Talk to my Kishashi. If she will trust you, I will trust you.
Did you talk to Kishashi? I can't trust you if she doesn't. It's nothing personal, really; it's just that everyone else is out to get me.
Wouldn't surprise me if you were here spying on me for You-Know-Who.
Did Kishashi send you with something? A certain utensil, or weapon... depending on who you ask?
Have you spoken with Kishashi? Until she sends word you are a friend, I will not speak to you. Not another word.
Hurry. We don't want anyone to see us talking, do we?
Perhaps you are the one? No, probably not. Never mind. But then again..
Ranarr-Jo is in need of a hero, but I'm not certain you are to be that one. First, you must earn his trust.
Make it quick. I've work to do. I need five pod pits.
Normally the peasants do that work, but pod pits are special. They hatch into beautiful birds!
Yes? Oh look, you have some pod pits! I need five of those myself.
I suppose I can stop to chat with a friend, but I'm really busy.
Have you found anything for me?
So much to gather, so little time. Perhaps you can help? You might help against the coming storm.
What do you call someone who messes everything up? You.
How many J'zidzos can you fit in a breadbox? One! There's only one!
What do you call someone who wants to kill you? Nothing!
Know what's funny about having a double? Nothing!
I didn't like you before. Now I really don't like you. What a mess.
I still don't like you, but you do good work.
You're working for the Manics. Now, I really don't like you.
I don't like you. I don't like my double even more.
You've written a tragedy in our small town.
I love happy endings!
This won't be the end of my story! Stay away!
Someone should write a book about the problems we're having with our doubles here in Split.
You sure didn't mess things up. No. Not at all. Didn't make things much worse. Not at all.
I hate the fact that you've made everything better! I just hate it!
You aren't going to kill me. I know it.
I've never seen my own double. And I certainly don't want to talk about it.
There's nothing more to do here. Go! Before someone suspects us!
Thank you for helping us overthrow the tyrant. But you must understand that as Queen, I'm very busy ruling over the Shivering Isles. Run along.
Ranarr-Jo is dead. What am I to do now?
I'm sure there is somebody who is really interested in what you have to say. Too bad for you that somebody ain't me. Buzz off.
Did you hear the one about the Argonian Maid?
I just love talking to you, really.
Got any stories? I love stories.
I like dogs. Dogs are pretty.
He may look slow... okay, he is slow. But what do you expect for this price?
I can't sell you any horseflesh. You'll have to go inside and talk to Cat Face.
S'shani. The old sea captain and rover... now a shipowner and fatcat. Pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the Oak and Crosier. This one is Talasma, your hostess. Our rooms and food are at your disposal.
It is just Ra'qanar, the poor porter. Do you wish to beat me? Punish me? Of course,  Ra'qanar deserves your scorn... but pity this one, please.
Urjabhi helps his brothers, Ra'Jiradh and Hassiri, to run the Black Horse Courier. Others write. We organize, we deliver. The news never stops!
Ra'Jiradh greets you. His brothers are Hassiri and Urjabhi. The Black Horse Courier is our Imperial news service, chartered by the Elder Council.
The Black Horse Courier. Brothers Urjabhi and Ra'Jiradh, and I, Hassiri. We bring the news of the Empire to the people of the Empire! Fast, fast!
Here, have a copy. It's free! Always free! We're funded by the Elder Council, so I don't mind, really. He he he he.
Ra'jhan has a fine house in Elven Gardens. Yes? It costs Ra'jhan many golds. But it is very fine, yes?
S'rathad greets you.
J'mhad keeps the grounds of the Temple nice and neat. Other things, J'mhad does, when they ask.
Dro'Nahrah. I'm Count Bravil's steward. I'm sorry, but please, I have too much on my mind to talk.
Nahsi, your humble servant, and humble servant of the Nine. I offer training in the marital arts of Hand-to-Hand fighting.
Dro'shanji greets you. His work is the castle grounds, grand gardens green. Dro'shanji also is Advanced Trainer in Security.
Yes. S'krivva gives you greeting. Luxury imports, exports are S'krivva's fair game.
Ah. S'krivva hears of you. Welcome, and well-fare in your craft and trade.
I'm J'zin-Dar. I tell you, so you can tell everyone who kicked the crap out of you. J'zin-Dar. Get it right.
What you want? It's okay. R'vanni doesn't mind. R'vanni likes it....
Well, you've found the Three Sisters. Beds and food. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.
I'm Shuravi, the sister-that-works-and-worries. Shamada is sweet and decorative. Shomara is dumb as a post. But she can cook, at least.
I'm Shamada, hostess of the Three Sister Inn. Speak to Shuravi if you need beds or meals.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Got to get cooking. I'm the cooking sister. I'm Shomara. The cooking sister.
Tsavi, Count's Mage and Castle Healer, your servant.
I'm Tsrava. I'm an Advanced Trainer in Acrobatics. Did I mention I hate dogs?
So keep your dogs away from me... unless they want some advanced lessons in plunging from great heights...
I am Ri'zakar, Pakseech of the Blackwood Company. The Company provides expert jihatt for selected customers. Very discreet.
Commander Ja'Fazir. Your servant. I am second-in-command of the Blackwood Company.
The Company provides expert jihatt for selected customers. Very discreet.
Yes. Ahdarji is the name. Poor Ahdarji, all alone, now that Qa-Dar is gone. Poor widow Ahdarji...
Ahdarji trains, yes. Light Armor is the skill. Ahdarji must work very hard, now she is all alone in the world.
Look. I don't know you. I don't really want to know you. If you insist on talking to me, go right ahead. But I won't promise to be nice.
I thought I made it perfectly clear. I'm not interested in whatever you are selling, so if you don't mind...
Don't you have something better to do than bother perfectly innocent people with your idiotic rambling? But if you insist, go right on ahead.
I don't know where you got the impression that I want to talk with you.  You must be kinda slow, huh?
Eh? Oh... I'm sorry. I was just... nothing. Never mind. I am Ranarr-Jo. I work the fields here in Fellmoor.
All day, every day, I work them. And for what? For Cindanwe? You think I am her servant, yes? If it weren't for her magic, things would change.
Cindanwe would breathe her last breath with my hands around her throat and my sweet Kishashi would take her place. If only...
Speak quickly. Cindanwe watches us. She watches us always...
I am Kishashi and Fellmoor is my domain. A queen, some would call me. But others will say that Cindanwe is in charge. Pah! Liars!
Her majesty cannot tolerate a liar. It is I who makes the rules here. If you need anything, you come to me.
I am Kishashi, great hero of the northlands. I once single handedly held off an entire horde of Grummites.
Have you heard my story about the time I beat seven Orcs in a drinking contest? I'm famous for it!
I have died seven times, each more painful than the last. But still, I return! Would you like to hear about it?
Tonight's duel should be good. Stay and watch.
It's gone... all of it, gone! Have you seen any of it? Any of my things? The others... they think I'm stealing, but I just want my things back.
Ah, you again. Have you seen any of Ma'zaddha's things? A shiny spoon, or a broken bottle? I can't find them.
I'm J'zidzo. What has four legs, a tail, and is red in Cyrodiil?
A bloody black horse courier. Hahahaha! ... Ahahaha!
What time is it when a Minotaur sits on your fence? Time to get a new fence! Ahaha!
A day without sunshine is like... night. Ahahaha!
Why do wizards write books? Because they're good at spelling! Ahahaha!
Why did the bandit take a bath? To get a clean getaway! Ahaha!
Why are pirates, pirates? Because they just Arrrghhh! Oh ho ho ho!
Did you hear about the two Argonians that walked into a tavern? The second one should have seen it coming. Ahaha!
What did Sheogorath say to the man who refused to wear pants? "Come to the Shivering Isles, I can clearly see you're nuts!" Ahahahaha!
Why did Sheogorath measure the Shivering Isles? Because he's the ruler! Ah ho ho ho!
What do you call a Golden Saint who has his fingers stuck in his ears? Anything you like, he can't hear you. Ahahaha!
I wouldn't be caught dead with a necrophiliac.  Ahaha!
On the other hand... you have different fingers. Oh ho ho ho!
Hello. I'm Atrabhi! People think I'm not friendly because I'm always reading. I enjoy a good conversation, though.
Oh, hello. The real world just isn't as colorful as the ones in the story books, is it? Nor as truthful as the essays and histories. Alas.
Hi there. You remind me of one of the characters from a story I've been reading. What can I do for you?
Hi there. Not to be rude or anything, but I'm anxious to get back to my book.
Madgod! I've been collecting jokes for you. I have thousands for you to listen to. Did you hear the one about the Grummite and the Heretic?
Lord Sheogorath, up off his throne and slumming it with us little folk, eh? Well, it's good to see you. What can I possibly do for you, My Lord?
My Lord, there aren't enough pages in all the books in the world to hold your glory!
Is it my Lord Sheogorath? It can't be.
Lord Sheogorath, I trust you'll protect us from the impending apocalypse.
Please do make it rain burning dogs.
Your money or your life.
This is a hold up. Hand it over or die.
Pay up, or else.
M'aiq knows much, tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not.
Good to see you again. What can I do for you?
Thanks for coming. Since we had the Hero of Kvatch available, I didn't think it made sense to try this on our own the first time.
We're ready when you are. Just say the word and we'll follow you into that hell-spawned Gate.
We're ready when you are.
Let's make these bastards sorry they messed with Bruma.
It was an honor to serve with you, ma'am. Now that I've seen how it's done, I think my guardsmen and I can handle any new Gates that open near Bruma.
It was an honor to serve with you, sir. Now that I've seen how it's done, I think my guardsmen and I can handle any new Gates that open near Bruma.
Thanks for your help closing that Gate. Don't worry, we can handle anything else they throw at us.
This is no place I ever wanted to find myself. I don't see how we can ...
No ... no, we can do this. We have to do this. We have no choice.
I'm glad you're here. We wouldn't have a chance otherwise. What's our next move?
What's the plan, sir?
What's the plan, ma'am?
So you found your way to Gaiar Alata at last. Don't we have enough troubles here, without you adding to them?
Leave us alone. Your quarrel is with Mankar Camoran, not us poor fools.
This is no time for talking!
Come on. My men will need all the help they can get today.
I'm only the Captain of the Guard. The Countess makes the final decision, and I follow her orders, whatever I think of them.
The Countess has received word from Cloud Ruler Temple that grave matters are afoot. Nothing else concerns her at the moment.
I know you. You freed me. Free my brothers, if they are still enslaved. Together we will cleanse the Shrine of the Underking's foul magic.
Congratulations on your victory! I admit, I thought your plan would lead to disaster, but you came through for Bruma. I won't forget it.
Well, well, still alive, are we? Amazing. I never thought you'd make it past the first combatant. Just make sure you remember your place, Brawler.
Ah, so it's Bloodletter now, is it? I remember when I achieved that rank, so very long ago. I showed such promise... unlike yourself.
My my my, look at the Myrmidon. Who are you fighting against up there, cripples and skooma addicts? Maybe some day they'll give you a real challenge.
Warrior? You? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Just... Just look at you! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
So it's Gladiator now. Oh, I do long for the day when you can prove your true worth to me... in the Arena! Until that day comes, you are nothing!
You're wearing a Battle Raiment! Oh, isn't that cute. The wittle boy wants to pway dwess up. Go home, momma's boy, before you get yourself killed.
You're wearing a Battle Raiment! Oh, isn't that cute. The wittle girl wants to pway dwess up. Go home, princess, before you get yourself killed.
I guess Owyn will let anyone join the Arena these days. I guess I shouldn't let it bother me, seeing as how you'll be dead tomorrow.
I'm trying to train here, weakling. Why don't you go someplace more your speed, like the Mages Guild?
So, it's Hero now, is it? I suppose the little urchin wants to be a Champion. Bah! You will never join our ranks! We are gods among mortals!
Know this -- if you truly wish to become a Champion, you'll have to go through me. If we meet in that Arena, I will make you beg for death.
Leave me alone. I'm busy.
You've made your choice and forsaken the name Arden-Sul. I have no wish to speak to you.
There's no need to mourn. The Ritual has begun! Be happy!
What can I do for you on this fine, fine day?
Are you here to rescue me?
Look, j-just stop right there, all right?
I can't let you leave with that amulet. I need it, right now.
Yes? Is there something I can help you with, Associate?
Ha ha! We did it, my friend! The killer is dead, and this nightmare is just about over. All we have to do now is find a way out of here!
Well, hello there. Nels is my name. Some call me Naughty, but don't you believe it! Hahahaha!
It's funny. I like just about everyone, but the very sight of you makes me sick. Why don't you go look for the gold someplace else, friend.
I'll let you in on a little secret. If I find the chest of gold, I'm going to open a tavern.  The Hoary Boar! It's been my dream since I was a boy.
Someone's been murdered! By Ysmir's beard, I need a drink!
Well, my friend, the search is on, eh? I wonder how much gold is actually in the chest? A thousand pieces of gold? Ten thousand?
I guess it all depends on the size of the chest. The bigger the better, of course, but where would our mysterious host have hidden such a thing?
Someone has been killed. I don't suppose you know anything about that, now do you?
Have you heard, my friend? One of our fellow guests has been murdered! This bodes ill for our stay, and our search for the gold.
Well, look at you. Two people have been horribly murdered, and you're right as rain. Strikes me as odd, that does.
Two people, dead. If anyone else drops, I swear I'm going to gather every drop of alcohol in this house and drink myself into a stupor.
I haven't seen death like this in a long, long time. It's a bit more than my nerves can handle, I'm afraid.
I plan to gather up every drop of drink in this house and keep it to myself, if things get any worse around here. I find comfort there, you see.
You're enjoying all of this, aren't you? You like seeing us squirm! What in blazes is going on here? Do you have something to do with this?
Three people... murdered. I know I shouldn't go wandering off alone right now, but for the love of Ysmir, I need a drink!
I need to find some real spirits. I think I saw some mead down in the basement. I don't care if it's not safe! It's my nerves! I need to calm down.
My friend, please stay safe! Three of us have been murdered! Besides you and me, there's only one guest left, if you know what I'm saying.
I've seen death like this before. Many years ago, my daughter was murdered by bandits who came to our village. I'm sorry... I... I need a drink.
Please, not now. I just want to be by myself for a bit.
By the gods, you're the only one left. It was you! How could you? How could you have killed all those people? You won't take me so easily!
You! What do you want? If you're looking for something to drink, I can't help you. It's mine. It's all mine. It's the only thing I have...
You want to know something, my friend? I just don't care anymore. We're the only two left. I know I didn't kill those people, so that leaves you.
And now you're here to kill me, right? Well, let's get this over with.
So, the last guest finally arrives. I'll tell you what I told all the others. You go in, I lock the door. You don't come out 'til it's over.
Now I'll tell you what I didn't tell everyone else. We have the same Mother, you and I. And she wants you to have this. It's the key to the house.
I guess someone else has already told you the other details. Kill all the guests then leave, right? Well, you'd better get in there. Time to mingle.
Well, what are you waiting for. There's a party, and you're the guest of honor. All I get to do is lock the damn door. You get to have all the fun.
Join the Fighters Guild? Fight, and get paid for it.
Have you found me ectoplasm?
There's little more to discuss. If they bring me ogre teeth, I'll pay.
Hail! What can Newheim the Portly do for you?
Well now, what might you want?
Look, I... I got nothing else to say to you. Just leave me be!
Eridor says I ain't supposed to chat with people in town. Sorry.
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
At your service. What do you need?
If you're here to help, you'd better talk to Thalfin.
I'm set. As soon as they're close enough, they're dead.
I'm ready to fight. Where do you need me?
Thalfin's in charge. She's been waiting for you.
Shhh! This is our time for silent prayer. You may wait outside, or quietly in here. We usually finish around the eleventh bell.
What can this peaceful monk do for you, stranger?
I wish there were children here. Scrumptious, darling children. I haven't eaten in so long. Ravel will tell me what to do. You, too.
Ahh... much better. You repulse me now, at least to a degree. Others should find you foul, disgusting. Namira may be pleased. Approach the shrine.
Why are you here? You are still too pleasing to speak with Namira. Begone.
Who are you? Why do you invade our place of worship? Surely, you don't think yourself worthy to visit Namira's shrine.
We know how to deal with criminals in Bleaker's Way!
Every last Dark Elf in Bleaker's Way is dead. Such madness... how did it ever start?
Where are those Dark Elves? Let me deal with them!
These are troubled times in Bleaker's Way. What do you want?
Welcome to Bleaker's Way, stranger. What can I do for you?
What else do you need? We don't want any trouble.
From these Gatekeeper bones I can make some arrows.
We need to get through the Gates of Madness. Let's go kill the Gatekeeper!
The Gatekeeper is slain. Congratulations. The honor of taking the keys from his corpse is yours.
Should we continue on?
We need those Gatekeeper bones. You ready to go to the Gardens with me?
Ahh! You burn with the purging Fire of Agnon, the flame of Truth, the flickering beacon of hope in the gloom of despond!
Come, light the Great Torch for Dementia. Illuminate the conspiracies! Deepen the shadows! The people of Crucible await their Hero!
It would be a truly Demented act to light the Great Torch with a Flame purchased with the blood of the Golden Saints.
Come, light the Great Torch for Dementia!
You'll uplift the poor, suffering folk of Dementia with the Flame, then?
Light the Great Torch! Let the flames proclaim the glory of Dementia across the realm!
Once again has the Ritual of Accession come full circle!
The heart of Syl has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and the Demented welcome you with open arms.
I now declare you to be Duchess of Dementia of the Shivering Isles! May your wrath and anger be your guide.
I now declare you to be Duke of Dementia of the Shivering Isles! May your wrath and anger be your guide.
Your task is nearly complete. All that's left is to touch the Altar and let Arden-Sul devour the Duchess' heart.
Your desires are my command, my lord.
Your desires are my command, my lady.
You've made your choice and forsaken the name Arden-Sul. Please, leave me be.
How may I be of service to you, milord?
How may I be of service to you, milady?
It's a shame that you had all the fun before I could get here. Now, there's nothing left to do but rebuild.
If those Knights come back to Passwall, we'll be ready for 'em.
I'm disappointed in your choice. You'll find Mania to be a fickle friend.
The Great Torch flares with the light of Dementia! All of Crucible will be celebrating tonight!
Here. Take this. The reward you have earned. Quickly now. It's best if no one knows you wear this.
Arctus, High Priest of Dementia. I'm here to guide those that wish to serve themselves. What did you require?
You chose well. The Great Torch shines with the luster of Dementia and the glory of Sheogorath.
What did you require?
Hail. We got plenty of rooms if you want one.
We got plenty of rooms if you want one. Ain't nobody staying here these days 'cept old Rufio.
I don't care how bad I need the business. You ain't welcome here.
Yeah, I still got rooms. What do you need?
Hail, friend. Good to see you again. What can old Manheim help you with?
The Master doesn't like visitors. Leave this house. Now. If you're still here in twenty seconds, I will be forced to crush you.
For your sake, you'd better be on your way to the door.
Baenlin... Oh Baenlin... I loved ya, old man. I loved ya... But I couldn't protect ya... Oh Baenlin! Waaaahhhhh! [sobbing]
If you want a room or a drink, I'm your man. Otherwise, I got nothing to say to you.
It's very good to see you again.
Anything else I can help with, you just let me know.
What can I do for you today?
I suppose I should be happy to see you again. I'm not.
So? You a living statue or are you gonna say something?
Oh. It's Valga's errand boy! How goes the 'big important investigation'?
Wha- ? What are you doing up here? They find the Golden Galleon yet?
Hey! Who in Oblivion are you? You don't look like one of the Blackwater Brigands!
I had a feeling you'd catch on sooner or later. That's why I had this trap prepared for you. If you'll notice, the grave is already dug.
This time, it wasn't to take something away from the graveyard, it was to add something. I'm afraid all I can offer you is an unmarked grave.
I have been anxiously awaiting your return.
Any news about that certain task we discussed?
Feel free to browse, friend. It's nice to see a new shopper. I was afraid I lost any hope of new business ever since Thoronir opened up.
Feel free to browse, friend.
It was even easier than Maric promised. Push off.
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jollring. I come on behalf of my master, Umbacano.
He asked me to deliver this note. I believe it is an invitation to visit him at his manor in the Imperial City.
Welcome. My master instructed me to show you up immediately. Please follow me.
If you have the item my Lady seeks, I suggest you bring it to her. She hasn't slept a wink since you departed.
I'm sorry. You must speak to Countess Carvain for any further information.
Good day. I'm Tolgan, herald to Countess Narina Carvain here in Bruma. She requests your company at your earliest convenience.
Good day. I'm Tolgan, herald to Countess Narina Carvain.
Patience. We'll have... all night.
Be nice to get another pretty face in the gang. Hope to see you there.
I haven't seen you here before. Awww, and you're all alone too. How sad.
Well, if you're up to it, I think we can solve that little problem. You see, me and Faustina here are lonely too, and we've been looking for someone.
You look like just what we need.
I'll tell you what. We have a cozy farmhouse not far from here where we could... well... get to know each other much, much better.
I'll mark it down on your map, just so you won't forget where to find us. Meet us there around 11 in the evening.
I can promise you a night of fun you won't soon forget.
Talk to Faustina. She's got a proposition for you.
Sorry, I'm too busy counting the number of rat droppings in my cell.
Show me the proof.
Until you get out of here and I see an amulet, we have nothing more to say to each other.
By the way the guards tossed you in here, I can see you're no friend of theirs.
I don't know who you are, nor do I care. All I know is that I want you to leave.
I'm Mogens Wind-Shifter. I'm having a look around. You mind?
We have nothing to discuss.
I'm not interested in speaking with you!
I've never seen my Lady so happy. You've done well.
See anything you like?
Now that Bjalfi's gone, looks like I'm available again. Back to the old dating game.
Found Rockshatter yet by chance?
If you see my good-for-nothing husband, Bjalfi, tell him I want back what he stole from me!
I assume you've dealt with Raelynn appropriately.
I don't know how to make this request any simpler, but to put it bluntly, Raelynn the Gravefinder must die.
Hello there. Welcome to Aerin's Camp.
Lord Sheogorath! Have you found any yet?
Do you have any yet?
My boat is coming along swimmingly.
You've made a real mess of things here.
Good that things are settled. We can get back to work.
I heard you're working for those Demented freaks. Stay away from me!
Don't you have work to do? Like getting rid of those Demented bastards?
Made up your mind yet? There's work to be done.
I'd get more work done if it weren't for my layabout double living in town.
You've messed this place up. I'm tired just thinking about it.
Glad things are settled here. I can finally get some rest.
I heard you're working for those Manics. Leave me alone. I don't want trouble.
Have you taken care of business yet? It's exhausing just waiting for you.
Have you made up your mind? I'm getting tired just waiting for an answer.
My double is always working. It takes all my energy just watching him work. It's got to stop.
Yeah? What?
Exercise your mind and body through working hard, each and every moment.
Are you looking for a horse? The Wildeye Stables have the best Paint horses in Cyrodiil.
This is the Wildeye Stables.
Unfortunately I don't have any more horses to sell. I sold our last Paint horse to you.
I'm on my way to Rosethorn Hall now. I won't be long.
Hello, I heard you purchased the Servants Quarters for Rosethorn Hall, and I was wondering if you had anyone in mind to fill that position?
For 150 gold and a roof over my head, I'm yours.
Well, to help around the house I mean.
I see you are with the Gray Fox. Do you need a fence?
I'm really tired. Can we get on with this?
Did you really face down Mehrunes Dagon himself? They say he stood 200 feet high and crushed the Temple Dome with his fist!
I'm not easily impressed, but even I would think twice before going into one of those Oblivion Gates. Well done.
Aye. I'm Ulfgar Fog-Eye, master of the Anvil lighthouse. Visit the lighthouse any time. Fine view of the town and harbor.
They call me 'Wilhelm the Worm,' because dirt suits me fine. Town lets me live in the warehouse to keep out the rats.
Vigdis, Fighters Guild.
Everyone calls me Sten the Ugly. I got tired of beating people up for it. So go ahead. Live it up.
Heinrich Oaken-Hull, captain and shipmaster. My ship, the Serpent's Wake, is in for refitting, so I'm high and dry for a while.
I'm Newheim, Anvil harbormaster. I'm responsible for all harbor traffic, docks, duties and fees in Anvil harbor.
Brave deeds, friend. Taking the fight to Oblivion itself! I salute you.
A visitor. What a treat. So go ahead. Whoever you are. They call me Orgnolf Hairy-Legs. Because I got hairy legs. Am I going too fast for you?
I'm Bittneld the Curse-Bringer, captain of the Chorrol Guard. What can I do for you?
An honor to serve you. I'm Emfrid, owner and publican of the Grey Mare, at your service. A room? Or food? Whatever you wish.
Cheydinhal sleeps more soundly tonight, thanks to you, friend. What can I do for you?
Praise Arkay, and all her little woodland creatures! I'm Hil the Tall, Priest of Arkay.
I'm also a trainer in the arts of Alteration. I love magic, too. I love everything. And everyone. You, too.
Keld of the Isles. Guardian of the Fighters Guild. And how did I achieve that high rank, you ask?
Patience. Caution. Slow and steady wins the race, my father always said. Careless fighters get one last white shirt and a box. Not me.
I salute you for your daring, Hero of Kvatch! You've proven yourself once again here at Skingrad.
I'm Else God-Hater. Yes. I hate the gods. All gods. They can all bite my garters. And if you don't like it, YOU can bite my garters, too.
Welcome to Colovian Traders, Skingrad's finest selection of general merchandise. I'm Gunder. Just let me know what you want.
Not so loud, please. What a headache I've got. I'm Agnete the Smith. 'The Pickled' they call me. Sure wish I was pickled right now.
You want me? You sure? I'm Vigge. I'm Mages Guild, but I don't train or anything.
Welcome to Jensine's 'Good as New' Merchandise. I'm Jensine. Take your time. I'll be right here.
I'm Agarmir. And I'm a very busy man. Are you just fishing around, or do you have business with me?
You're talking to Algot the Northerner. Guess you've got nothing better to do.
If you'll just follow me, I will take you directly to my master.
Good to see you again, ma'am. Shall I escort you upstairs to see my master?
Good to see you again, sir. Shall I escort you upstairs to see my master?
Jollring, the butler. I've served Master Umbacano for many years.
Destroying the Great Gate was a deed worthy of the mightest heroes of song and legend! You dealt the daedra a heavy blow that day, my friend!
I heard that you helped the Guard close that Oblivion Gate. Thanks. We were getting worried about that damn thing.
I'm Petrine. This is Wildeye Stables. I look after folk's horses while they're here in Bruma.
Welcome to Bruma, stranger. Hafid Hollowleg. I'm your host at Jerall View. Bed, food, whatever you need.
I'm Logvaar. Hafid pays me to stand around and keep things quiet.
I'm Snar the Cook. We've got genuine Skyrim cuisine... fresh, simple, big helpings... just like Mom used to make.
Skjorta. Nord Winds. We've got clothes and armor. And I've got a headache, so keep your voice down, please.
I'm Olfand, the Light Armor trainer. Skjorta and I run North Winds. Please excuse us. We had a little drink-up last night. Still a little muzzy.
Fjotreid. You need armor or weapons, new or repair, come to Hammer and Axe.
I'm Captain Burd, commander of the Bruma Guard.
I'm Honmund. I'm a prospector. Alga's my woman, Nord-style. None of that Chapel wedding nonsense.
I'm Alga. I'm a bard and a Speechcraft trainer.
Honmund is my live-in partner. No offense, but I don't want to hear about any 'Mara Mother Mild' and Chapel family business.
Honmund and I live together in the old Nord way. Good enough for my Fa and Ma, and good enough for me.
Ongar the World-Weary, they call me. I've been everywhere, and done everything. Now I'm settled down for a good long rest.
I'm Regner. You want anything? Talk to Edla. She's in charge.
Edla. Edla Dark-Heart. If you want to be a Marksman, I can train you. If you can breathe, I can teach you.
Hero of Kvatch? How about the Hero of Bravil! No need to be modest, my friend!
I am Olava the Fair, Mara's Living Saint. It is my responsibility not to preach, but to live Mara's commands as an example to others.
Hans Black-Nail, Castle Smith. It's a comfortable post. Gives me plenty of time to offer services to the public.
Hey! That's me you're talking to! Reistr the Rotted! Hear me? Reistr! Wow! I got this a-MAZ-ing itch right on my thigh! Can't touch it! It's rough!
An impressive feat of arms, closing that Oblivion Gate outside Leyawiin. What can I do for you?
My name is Agata. I'm responsible for enchanted item recharge for the Guild here in Leyawiin.
My name is Margarte. Professionally, I'm a trade consultant... I offer Advanced Mercantile training, by the way...
... But my real passion is alchemy. I love brewing up new and interesting potions... just for fun!
It's a pity my busy consulting and training schedule leaves me little time for gathering ingredients...
... And heavens forfend that my husband, Eitar, devote a few minutes from his all-consuming hobby...
... stirring up trouble between Khajiits and Argonians, to help me find ingredients.
I'm Eitar. Say. Did you hear what that Argonian said? What's-his-name? You know who I'm talking about...
He said any Argonian can kick any Khajiit's butt to breakfast any day of the week. You believe that?
I think he's wrong. I KNOW Khajiit can kick Argonian butt. Any time. Any where. And you can tell everyone I said so.
I'm Eitar. Say. Did you hear what that Khajiit said? What's-his-name? You know who I'm talking about...
He said any Khajiit can kick any Argonian's butt to breakfast any day of the week. You believe that?
I think he's wrong. I KNOW Argonians can kick Khajiit butt. Any time. Any where. And you can tell everyone I said so.
Hello there. I suppose I should make the effort to introduce myself. I'm Horkvir Bear-Arm. I hope there isn't anything I can do for you.
Are you sure you want me? If not, I'd rather just sit down a while, or maybe take a nap.
Oh, hello. Can't you see I'm dozing off here? I was just daydreaming about how awful life is. I'd like to get back to that as soon as possible.
I hope there isn't something you need from me. Being needed is worse than being forgotten, isn't it? I think so. Well, go on. Go on.
Hello, my name is Tove. "The Unrestful," they call me. So much to do, and so little time. There's only one of me to go around, you know!
Hello there. You don't have any experience building boats, do you? I'm rather stuck, what without any instructions and all. Confusing stuff.
Hey there. I'm Horkvir Bear-Arm. They call me that because I once wrestled a bear, not because I work all day out in my garden without a shirt on.
Hey there. I'm really busy. Got lots to do. So if you don't mind, make it quick.
I guess I can spare you a minute. But not more than that. I've got to get back to work. Always more work to do than time to do it.
Well, I guess I can take a short break. A short one, mind you. I have lots to do still.
I'm Yngvar the Wanderer. Although most people now call me Yngvar Doom-Sayer. It's true, the world is about to be destroyed.
Some people are frightened by this, or they despair, or even try to deny the truth of what I say.
But my message is actually one of comfort. The world is ending, and we can't do anything about it. Once you accept that, you'll be at peace, like me.
Spread the word. The world is coming to an end. But it's nothing to worry about.
I don't understand... the world was supposed to end.... Order was supposed to destroy everything. It has always happened that way.
I am quite busy, but there is always time for you, Lord Sheogorath. What may I do for you?
I wonder. Do gods have bones? What wonderful things those must be!
Greetings, Madgod. I normally don't stop to chit-chat, but it's truly an honor. What can I do for you?
Sheogorath. What trouble brings you out this way?
I'm Jayred Ice-Veins. Do you ever wonder why things look better without their skin on?
For instance, you can only really see the bones when you take them out.
You can hear them better that way, too.
We should go hunting. Soon.
Do the bones talk to you, too?
Thanks. Kvatch is safer for all of us, now you've closed the gate.
You picked a bad time to visit Kvatch.
Please, just kill me! Can't you see? It's what I want! I can't live like this, knowing I'm something filthy, something evil! Kill me!
Hail, friend. I don't believe I've ever seen you down here in the Bloodworks before. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Agronak gro-Malog.
Most people just call me the Gray Prince. It's kind of silly, I know, but the people of Cyrodiil need heroes. I'm more than happy to oblige.
Ah, so you're an Arena combatant! It's always good to meet a fellow warrior, especially one who isn't here just to kill the Grand Champion! Ha ha ha!
I know who you are, of course, and it's easy to guess why you're here. You wish to challenge me for my title of Grand Champion, is that it?
Hail, friend! Good to see you again. I hope the Arena has been as good to you as it's been to me. What brings you back to the Imperial City?
Sorry, friend, but we've got nothing more to talk about. If you're ready to fight, talk to Ysabel and she'll arrange the match.
Hail, friend! Good to see you again. So tell me, what brings you back to the Imperial City?
Ah, so you've returned. Come at last to challenge me for my Grand Champion title?
You've returned! So, have you been to Crowhaven? Have you... Oh, I see you have not yet recovered any proof of my birth...
Please, friend. Make haste! This waiting about is torture! I know in my heart who I am, but with evidence I can prove my claim to all of Tamriel!
But wait, I'm sorry. I'm being selfish. You're a Champion, and have the right to challenge me for my Grand Champion title. Is that your wish?
You've returned! So, have you been to Crowhaven? Have you... What's this? The Journal of Lord Lovidicus? My friend, you've done it!
This is wonderful news! The words of the Lord Lovidicus himself! Perfect!
Ah, but I believe I owe you something, eh? Here, let me show you these moves. Step like this... Now strike.... All right, now parry... That's it!
There you are, some of the best combat moves you'll ever learn! You'll need them if you want to last more than five seconds against me in the Arena.
Now let me see what this Journal says! Hmm... Interesting... But... I... I... Wait... Can this be? But... By Shinji, I'm the son of a vampire!
I'm no "Gray Prince!" I'm the spawn of evil! I thought my father was a nobleman, not some blood-sucking monster! I... I can't... All a lie! A lie...
The... the journal... my father's journal.... It says I'm... I'm part vampire! I thought my father was a nobleman, not some blood-sucking monster!
My whole life has been nothing but a lie! I'm no "Gray Prince." I'm a vile, wretched spawn of evil! Please, leave me. I can't.... I...
Oh, but I see. You're a Champion... You want my Grand Champion title, is that it? Please, challenge me. In the Arena I can end my misery...
Are you... Are you ready to fight? Go talk to Ysabel, let her know. Then we'll, um... You know, we'll meet in the Arena. And it will all be over...
Talk to Diram in the inn. I'm tired of this minstrel's freakshow our town has turned into.
I'm sorry to tell you, but there are no more contracts to be had. As you know, business hasn't been good due to the Blackwood Company.
And... you didn't hear it from me, but I think you should go speak with Oreyn. Now. He'd like your help with a couple things.
I've got some bad news for you. Donton didn't take the news about her son well at all, not that you'd expect otherwise.
She's expelled Oreyn from the guild. Stripped him of all rank and privileges. And you, she's demoted you. You've been busted down to Protector.
I'm sorry this happened, but those are the Guildmaster's orders. I'm sure you can gain your rank back, in time.
Gah! Horrid beast! What do you want?
Why aren't you working?
Haven't you taken care of that weapons shipment yet? Those weapons won't deliver themselves!
You here looking for work, meat? Maybe you want a contract?
That was some good goblin bashing. What else you need?
Right. Let's get to bashing some goblin skulls.
You're the one with the weapons shipment, right? Let's talk about that.
What do you want? A job? If you want it from me, you'll have to join the Fighters Guild. Not that I'm sure you can cut it.
You look tough. Want to join the Fighters Guild?
We're looking for recruits. Think you're tough enough to join the Fighters Guild?
Hey, it's you. The one who found jobs. Whadda you need?
Are you still talking? Find us work. And money.
Whadda you want?
You need to finish out the contract with Biene Amelion in Water's Edge. What's the status?
I've got another contract for you, meat. I assume you won't embarrass yourself.
I'll assume you're back for more work, because I don't see a big need to chat with you.
You need to go find Lady Rogbut, meat! Why are you standing here talking to me?
I've got news for you. Vilena wasn't happy when she heard about Viranus. No shock there. She expelled Oreyn from the guild. It's a damn shame.
And you've been demoted to the rank of Defender. Hell, even I don't think you deserved that. But, it is what it is. Move on.
I've got some news for you. Vilena wasn't happy when she heard about Viranus. No shock there. She expelled Oreyn from the guild. It's a damn shame.
Words cannot express my gratification for your help.
You found my belabored daughter! I will tell Burz gro-Khash about your indentures! Take this. It has been passed in my family for many generators.
How may I persist you? Please, I need you to find my daughter.
Ah... you are from the Fighters Guild, I resume. Good show. I am Lord Rugdumph gro-Shurgak. Let us conversate on the Lady Rogbut.
Thanks for the help, not that I couldn't have taken care of it myself. If I were still allowed to carry an axe....
I suppose we should get back to my father. Time for me to be a noble again.
Glad you killed those things. I'd have done it myself, but apparently, that's not "ladylike." Hmmph. Let's get back to my father.
Don't just stand there -- get rid of those ogres! Stab them! Burn them! Tear their throats out!
You're supposed to be helping out the folks at Harlun's Watch. What's the status?
Here for more work? I've got one more contract for you.
You've got a contract to take care of. Why are you talking to me?
What can I do for you, meat? Need something to do?
What is your business in this place?
Malacath likes you. You don't look very foul or ugly... but just keep doing ugly stuff, and you'll be fine.
Malacath must think you're okay. Congratulations. You must be as ugly and disgusting as the rest of us.
You've been told what you have to do.
You've found the shrine of the Lord Malacath, friend Orc. You are welcome here.
You dare come here to the shrine of our lord? You are not one of us.
Were you invited? I didn't invite you.
Who's talking to you? I'm not.
He is a hard master, but he delivers. I gave my word, and an Orc honors his word.
He's too much! Killed all my men! Get out of my way!
I don't have time for you. Get out of my way!
Leave now! You are trespassing!
Now is not the time for business!
Hello! I'm Dumag gro-Bonk. Best and prettiest smith in town. I know the secret art of forging Amber. Here. Take this list. It explains what I need.
It is good to see you again, friend!
Welcome back! What can I do for you?
Welcome back, friend! It's a pleasure to serve you.
You think I'm ugly, don't you? And that she's a prettier smith? Is that it?
I am the Master Smith of New Sheoth. Why bother with that other smith?
What can you possibly see in her? She spends more time cutting herself than swinging a hammer.
Welcome! Welcome to the family! I'd hug you, but Ocheeva told me not to.
I know what you're thinking! Gogron, he's too big to be sneaky! Well you're right! Me, I like to just go in and hack my targets to pieces. Ha!
You and I, we've got to stick together, eh? The others, they don't understand. Orcs may not be quiet, but can anyone kill as well as us? Never!
Yes, Brother? What can old Gogron do for you?
Yes, Sister? What can old Gogron do for you?
We are kin, yet I cannot help but despise you. Leave my sight, before I do something I regret.
You. What do you want?
Thanks again for helping us. I'm sure Ormil will reward you appropriately.
I'm sure Ormil can help you now. I'm busy trying to get us home.
Like I said, I'm not moving the Float until Ormil is safe.
Sounds like the coast is clear, so I'll make my way up to the ship's wheel. But I'm not moving this hulk an inch until Ormil is safe.
I'll wait on the tavern deck until you clear the top deck. That's where the ship's wheel is located.
I'm not going to the top deck until it's safe.
Thank you for freeing me. I'm Graman gro-Marad, the Bloated Float's bouncer and helmsman. I've been locked in that storage room for hours.
I don't know exactly what's going on, but not long ago, a gang of thieves calling themselves The Blackwater Brigands stormed the ship.
They took myself and Ormil, the Float's owner, hostage and put the ship to sea. I have no idea what they're after.
If you can get me safely to the top deck, I can steer the Float home. But I'm not budging until the coast is clear.
I'm used to dealing with drunken louts, not a gang of well-armed thieves.
I'll wait here until the tavern deck is clear.
Move outta' my way.
Hey stranger, can you spare a few coins? I've just been shaken down by that bastard watchman and he took my last septim.
I've heard that you've been asking around about that corrupt guard. Just don't mention my name. I have enough problems.
These days I get nervous whenever I see a Watchman. Maybe I'll just stay inside.
I'm impressed that you killed all my clients. Doesn't matter. More will come along with their purses fat with gold and hearts lustin' for blood.
Too bad about Aleron. Didn't need him anymore now that yer here. At least now he's free of his debt... ha ha ha ha!
Get on that boat and get out of here. Yer wastin' yer own time.
Are you ready to go to the boat?
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you lookin' at? Get outta' my sight before I have you hacked off at the knees.
Black Brugo is dead, right? So I'm going to be a knight?
I'll go back and wait in the County Hall. You'll tell me when I'm a real knight? Please?
I'm with you, friend. We kill Black Brugo, and the Count makes us both knights.
If you're ready to go get Black Brugo, I'm ready to follow you.
I kept my oath. Mogens Wind-Shifter is dead. Now I return to Castle Leyawiin. Come visit me there some day.
Hello, friend. Thank you again for your help.
Mogens Wind-Shifter is dead. Ra'vindra is avenged. Now I return to Castle Leyawiin. Come visit me there some day.
I kept my oath. Mogens Wind-Shifter is dead.
Mogens Wind-Shifter had a gang. They robbed and killed travelers. But Ra'vindra saw, and told the guards.
Mogens got away, but first he killed Ra'vindra... my best friend, Ra'vindra.
That day, I became a knight, and swore a knight's oath.
I searched a long time, and asked everyone, then I finally heard he was hiding at Fisherman's Rock.
So now you know everything. You helped me, and I won't forget.
Take what you want from the dead. I came to keep my oath, and now I'm done.
You spoiled everything, you idiot!
What's the matter? What did you do?
Mogens and his dogs must die!
Get out of my way!
Take me to Fisherman's Rock. Now.
Weebam-Na won't take me to Fisherman's Rock.
Go tell Weebam-Na I want to see him. I'll wait right here.
Are you the Count?
You're getting on my nerves. What do you want?
I'm going to spend some time at the Lodge. Then maybe tonight, I might go hunt me some black bows.
Push off, scroat! We got nothing to talk about.
I hear Black Brugo is dead.
Did you tell the Count about Black Brugo?
Well, this saves me a bit of trouble. Aleron's dead even though I planned to kill him anyway. So, that just leaves you. Let the game continue!
Thanks for doing my work for me. Nothing like having someone else do your dirty laundry. Thanks, you idiot!
You're welcome on board the Bloated Float any time.
Hey, do you mind not trampling on my crops? What do you want?
Hey, you're the one made us visible again, right? Good show!
You've got a lot of nerve, showing your face around here after what you done to us.
I am Bat gro-Orkul, warden of the armory. If you need weapons or armor, I've got them.
I'm keeping Vitharn's weapons and armor safe from thieves and miscreants.
You... you're a cat! Get away from me!
Kill! Kill the cat! Good dog.
Ew. You smell worse than that cat, Bhisha. Get away from me!
That cat beggar is following me! He's going to eat me, Lord Sheogorath, I just know it. Don't look! He's standing right over there.
That cat beggar is following me! He's going to eat me, I just know it. Don't look! He's standing right over there.
You haven't seen that filthy cat beggar have you?
You cute little bunny. You've done a horrible thing here. Bad bunny. Bad!
You little sugar pie! You've done such a good job! Yes, you have!
You're a dangerous little rascal! Stay away from me!
Have you seen my double, you cute little monkey? Have you?
You horrible creature! You've ruined everything!
You've done good work here! Now, please, don't hurt me.
Stay away, you monster! I know what you're up to!
Don't bare your teeth at me, you beast! How about you use those fangs on my double?
I scour the land, seeking fortune for Gortwog and Orsinium. Someday all will recognize the true wealth of the Orcs!
You too seek wealth, do you not? May you find it, and may tales of your journey be legendary.
Well met, traveler. Are you seeking treasure as well? Gortwog demands riches, so all of Tamriel will respect Orsinium.
So we search the lands and bring home whatever we find. This makes Gortwog happy.
I must return to my task, for Gortwog waits. May you find all that you seek, traveler.
Yikes! Get away from me you foul beast!
Well, aren't you just the cutest little thing!
Yes? How can I help you?
You want a horse? I can sell you one. There are no finer Bay horses than those sold by the Grateful Pass Stables.
I am Ugak, owner of the Grateful Pass Stables.
I must apologize. I don't have any more horses to sell. I sold our last Bay horse to you.
I'm Krognak gro-Brok, landsman, and I don't much care who you are.
Gorgo gro-Shura. Soldier of fortune. Which means, more-or-less, unemployed and thoroughly pauperized.
Things could always be worse. And probably will be. I'm Kurz gro-Baroth. What can I do for you?
I'm Lum gro-Baroth. The cheerful one. My brother, Kurz? He's not so cheerful.
I am Orok gro-Ghoth, steward to Countess Arriana Valga, Countess of Chorrol. I manage her affairs, and the castle is in my keeping.
Blessings. I'm Orag gra-Bargol, servant of Stendarr. May you grow in the Faith.
I'm busy, here, okay? You mind giving us some privacy?
I got stuff to do. Don't bother me.
Well, ain't you the high-tom-titty? You want something, I guess, or you wouldn't be messing up my air.
Borba gra-Uzgash. We've got everything the adventurer needs. I'm an old adventurer myself, and I know what's wanted.
Me? I'm Magub gro-Orum. Borba and me, we were pals in the adventuring trade. Now I help him run the store.
I'm Burz gro-Khash, and I'm in charge of this St. Jiub's Fair. All I need is clowns, monkeys, and jugglers. No. Wait... just need jugglers....
Yeah. This is the Cheydinhal Fighter's Guild. Look around. See any fighters? Right. That's the problem. No fighters, no guild.
Get lost. Or I'll pull your arm off.
You don't listen? You stupid? Crot. I'm wasting my breath. Then go ahead. Stand there. Talk all you want. You're a fly. Go ahead and buzz.
Buzz, buzz, buzz. Go away, little fly.
Yeah? I don't care who you are. I ain't talking to you. You ain't from around here. So push off.
I'm done talking to you. You ain't listening. I got better things to do.
I'm the cook of Riverside, Rogmesh gra-Coblug. I don't get paid to chat, if you don't mind.
I'm Maknok gro-Coblug, the Riverside groundskeeper. Rogmesh, my wife, is the cook at the Big House.
Yeah? You're who? And why do I care, exactly?
Yeah. I don't need you. So go away, huh? I'm asking real nice, because my mom brought me up right.
Yeah! I'm Bazur gro-Gharz. I got protection from the Orum Gang. So don't mess with me. Or they'll fillet you real good.
I'm Mog gra-Mogakh, proprietor of Two Sisters Lodge. My sister and I own the place... 'Two Sisters', see? Need a bed? Good food?
Sorry. You want me? I'm Shum gro-Yarug, the Count's butler.
Urbul gro-Orkulg knows you NEED axes and blunt weapons. BIG ones. So he makes them and sells them here...
... Slash 'N Smash... the BIG Orc Weapon Shop. BIG weapons. For BIG heroes.
Dul gro-Shug. I could show you a thing or two about Security... for a small consideration.
Graman gro-Marad. I'm a bouncer for the Bloated Float. My wife, Umog, is a night guard for Master Umbacano.
My name is Umog gra-Marad. I'm employed by Master Umbacano as a night guard.
I'm sorry. Luronk gro-Glurzog is my name. I don't get about very much. For various reasons.
Graman gro-Marad. I'm the night man on the Bloated Float.
Uzul gro-Grulam. I'm courting Myvryna Arano, so stay away from her. I got matrimony on my mind.
Snak gra-Bura, owner and proprietor. We board horses. And... well... we don't actually sell horses. Anymore, that is.
I'm Bogrum Gro-Galash, your host at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. It may not look like much outside, but that's just the weathered Bravil look.
Brokil gro-Shatur, Lord High Warden of the Taps, Gilgondorin's most prized customer. I taste everything. Over and over. And over again...
Yeah. Buy a goddam book. It's a bookstore, ain't it? Don't just go peeking at them! Buy one!
I'm Bugak gro-Bol, and I say you better buy a goddam book. And right away, dammit!
I'm Urul gro-Agamph. You shouldn't scare people like that. I don't care if you are a mean nasty wolf. It isn't nice. Okay, okay. Just don't hurt me!
Yikes! Get away from me you foul beast! Somebody help! A mountain lion has gotten into the village!
Don't eat me! For the love of Sheogorath! Please, don't eat me!
Nice doggy. Good doggy. Don't hurt me, doggy. Doggy want a bone? No no, not my bones, not my bones! Eeek!
I've never seen such a huge bird. Don't peck out my eyes! I mean it. Stay back, you!
You! You're one of them! What do you want with me? Scratch me with your claws? Steal my breath? My babies will protect me!
This is a private gathering of our... society. You may watch, but don't interfere.
Wait... you're not one of them... no. You're fine. Cats. They're everywhere. But my babies protect me.
Why do you torture me? I don't want any trouble with your kind! I've got dogs, you know. Vicious ones!
Ever vigilant. That's my motto. They'll sneak up on you. Because they're sneaky. Sneaky fur. Sneaky whiskers.
Dulphumph gro-Urgash, Scalon killer. You'll keep quiet, if you know what's good for you. Never know when one might be sneaking up behind you.
I hope you covered your tracks. Last thing you want is a Scalon picking up on your scent, and catching you when you're not looking.
Hello, little one! I'm Urul gro-Agamph. All kinds of cute animals come to visit me. Just like you did! You're a pretty butterfly, aren't you?
You're certainly a cute little thing aren't you? Did you fly a long way? You did? Come here and perch on my shoulder for awhile.
Hello there! You're a cute little thing, aren't you? A little baby bear. Did you get lost?
I've never seen such colors on a cat before. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!
Are you a gruff little dog, are you? Well, come curl up here by my feet then.
Lord Sheogorath, here in Deepwallow? May Scalon blood flow at your feet, Lord!
A God. My God. Wow. I thought little furry puppy dogs were the cutest thing in the world. But, look at you! I could just eat you up!
Don't eat me. DON'T EAT ME! By Sheogorath's beard, you're a mean looking one!
How may I serve, my Lord?
You honor me, Lord. May your Realm be free of cats.
You closed the gate. That's the first good news in a long time.
I don't have much. I lost everything.
You need to get out of here. There's no telling who will come first, the Blades or more assassins.
I thought so. A few rats and goblins won't give you any trouble.
I wasn't far off. In any case, rats and goblins won't give you any trouble.
Really? I would never have guessed. Still, I don't think you'll have any trouble with rats and goblins.
We've failed. I've failed ... The Blades are sworn to protect the Emperor, and now he and all his heirs are dead.
The Amulet, where's the Amulet of Kings? It wasn't on the Emperor's body.
The Emperor! I must get to the Emperor!
You may as well make yourself useful. Here, carry this torch and stick close.
You may as well make yourself useful. Carry that torch and stick close.
There's no time to talk now, prisoner. We've got to keep moving.
I told you to keep out of our way.
Good to see you again. I told Martin that Mankar Camoran was no match for you.
I look forward to fighting by your side again.
Sit down. Don't say anything. Just do what I say.
I'm being watched. Just sit down. Don't say anything.
Listen. I'm going to get up in a minute and walk out of here. That guy in the corner behind me will follow me. You follow him.
I told you to stay back and keep an eye on the guy who was watching me.
Search his body. I'll keep an eye out, in case any of his friends are nearby.
Good work. I am glad to see you, by the way. You just caught me at a bad time.
You're not easy to get a hold of. What have you found out?
Alright. The room with the table is just through this door. I always wondered who put it there.
I happen to know that if you go up the stairs there, you can get a vantage point on the meeting room.
I think I'd better be the one to handle the meeting. You'll be my backup. Keep watch from above in case of trouble.
Aren't you supposed to be going to see Tar-Meena? I have plenty of leads of my own to track down, don't worry.
I think you're onto something with those books. You should finish tracking them all down, and then we'll see what we've got.
So far Mankar Camoran's books are our best lead. You should keep working on getting copies of all four.
I know the part of the sewers you were talking about. Follow me, I'll show you.
So, here's the plan. I'll meet with the Sponsor, while you cover me from the upper gallery. What do you think?
You're taking the meeting. You'd better get in there before they realize you didn't come alone.
We agreed I would meet the Sponsor. You need to get out of sight before you blow the whole meeting.
That could have gone smoother. Can't say I minded killing a few more of these bastards, though. Get the book and let's get out of here.
Get the book and let's go.
Now that you have all four books, you should be able to handle things from here.
I'm going to Cloud Ruler Temple. My place is at Martin's side.
Have you seen Alain or Valdemar? Rielus fell in the lower chamber. We were separated ... the fog blinded us ...
No ... that was the dream. I am awake now. I must fulfill my oath to the Emperor before I can finally rest.
I was honored to fight by your side again.
Martin couldn't have done it without you. I count you among the greatest heroes of the Blades.
To think we'd end up here, after such a beginning! Sending an escaped prisoner off with the Amulet of Kings...
But I never doubted you, my friend. Emperor Uriel, he had the vision of the Dragonborn. He saw something in you. And he was right.
I never had time to properly thank you for your help back in the Imperial City. I wouldn't have made it back here if it weren't for you.
Now that we have a free moment, I thought you might be able to use some tricks I've picked up fighting with the Blades over the years.
Nobody who hasn't trained with the Blades will know these moves, so you should find them useful.
See, when they swing at you sidearm, you twist your wrist like this... exactly! You're a natural at this. Let me show you another one...
Whatever you need, friend.
You idiot! You complete piece of gutter trash! Two disqualifications? That's it! You are hereby stripped of all titles! Get out of my Bloodworks!
You complete and utter disgrace! Disqualified? For not wearing your Battle Raiment? Don't you dare humiliate the Blue Team like this again!
You listen good. This is your only warning. One more disqualification, and you'll never fight in the Arena again! Now get out of my sight!
You blew it. You had it in the palm of your hand and you threw it all away. You make me sick.
You did it! You beat them, every last one! Do you know how long it will take for the Yellow Team to recover from this? Ha ha ha ha ha!
My friend, it is with great honor that I advance you to the rank of Champion! You've done it! You've shown them all you're the best!
Well, almost the best... You're done competing in normal Arena matches. But there's still the Grand Champion...
Kid, you've got more guts. And skill. I think you can take the Gray Prince! Go over and talk to Ysabel if you think I'm right!
I'll be honest, Hero. With the kinds of victories you've been having, I knew that Elf didn't stand a chance. Here's your gold.
Defeating an Arena Hero is one thing, but defeating a former member of the Blades? You must be blessed by the Divines or somethin', my friend.
By defeating that Breton, you've secured your advancement. It's been a long time since I've said this, but congratulations, Hero.
You showed that cat whose claws are sharper, eh? I would expect no less. Here's your gold. Now go wash up. You look awful.
The Yellow Team surprised even me with that match. Three against one! I guess they didn't know who they were dealin' with, huh? Well done!
You hit that Orc so hard, her mother in Orsinium started bleedin'! That victory advances you to the rank of Gladiator. Enjoy the gold.
Another High Elf has been taught the meaning of humility, thanks to the Blue Team's number one Warrior. You really earned your keep this time.
You left that Nord in pretty rough shape, Warrior. They'll probably have to ship her back to Skyrim in pieces. Nice work. Here's your take.
There are few things scarier than an Orc with an axe, but you didn't even flinch! That victory brings you up to Warrior rank. Well done!
Altmer. They act all high and mighty until you leave them in a pool of their own blood. Here's your gold. Go take a breather.
I guess you told that Wood Elf what you thought of his magic dagger, huh? He he he he. Here's your gold. Nice going.
Good work, Bloodletter. Or should I say Myrmidon? That's right, you've risen in rank. You know how it works. More blood, more gold. Here.
Okay, so you killed the Breton. Don't get a big head. Here's your payout.
That was a good fight, Bloodletter. You really showed that Redguard who's boss! Here's your take. Now go clean yourself up.
Okay, so you can fight. Your new title is Bloodletter. You're gettin' into the real game now, kid. More gold for more blood. Don't disappoint me.
Ha! Those girls didn't stand a chance! Good job, Brawler. Here's your take. One more match and you'll advance again.
Four wins is okay kid, but it don't make you Grand Champion. Here's your payout. Now go clean yourself up before your next match.
Okay, so you did it again. What do you want from me, a hug? Take your gold and get out of my face, Pit Dog.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but you're no longer a Pit Dog. That's right, you've actually advanced in rank. Congratulations... Brawler.
By the Nine Divines, you did it! You actually won! You ain't so bad after all, Pit Dog. You may even survive enough matches to advance in rank.
Here, kid, this is your payout for the victory. There's more where that came from if you can keep on winning. Now go unwind before your next fight.
You're about to face off against the best the Yellow Team has to offer. Azura knows you're the best the Blue Team's got.
Hello, my friend! What can this grizzled old Blademaster do for you?
I don't know who you are, friend, but you've got about ten seconds to tell me what you're doing in my Bloodworks before I lop your arms off.
You again, huh? So what is it this time? Better start talkin' before my sword starts swingin'!
You haven't run home to momma yet, huh? That's a good sign. So, you ready for a match, or do you just need some information?
Okay, so you're not a complete loser. Don't get cocky. Let me know when you're ready for a match and you can prove yourself to me some more.
What are you waiting for? You signed up for this, maggot! Now get up to that Arena and fight!
Hey, something wrong? They're waiting for you up in the Arena!
That Raiment's getting a little tight on you, Brawler! I think you need some exercise! What do you say? Ready for a match?
So, ready for your next match?
The Yellow Team ain't gonna fight itself, you lazy Pit Dog! You ready for a match, or what?
You know what Brawler rank is worth around here? Nothing! Face it kid, you're still a maggot! You need to keep fighting if you want to be somebody!
Slowly but surely, maggot. You got a good streak going. Don't sissy out on me now! You ready for another match, or what?
You beatin' those twins is a good sign. You got a lot of fight in ya. Let me know when you're ready to get bloody again.
You made it to Bloodletter, which is more than I can say for most people who step into that Arena. Keep it up.
Come on Bloodletter, don't lose your momentum now. Keep fighting!
My Red Room got its paint job from fighters like you! After you disembowel the next idiot, I want you to smear his blood all over the walls! Ha ha!
All right, Myrmidon, time to stop messing around! You ready to teach those Yellow Team scumbags a lesson, or what?
You're hungry, Myrmidon! I can see it in your eyes! You ready to feed that hunger? Huh? You ready for another match?
You're cutting through the Yellow Team like a knife through scrib jelly! One more fight and you'll advance to Warrior rank!
You're a Warrior now. That ain't no joke. They may not know your name, but the people out there, the spectators, they know you now.
They come to this Arena to see you, so go out there and give the people what they want!
Look at you! You keep coming back for more! All right, Warrior, you ready for a match?
One more match is all you need to advance again, up to Gladiator rank. Most combatants never make it that far. But you are the exception, aren't you?
Gladiator. It's not very often I get to call somebody that. You're doing the Blue Team proud, kid. Now go kill somebody before I get all weepy!
You ain't gonna stop until you hit Champion, are you? Well good! The Blue Team needs as much glory as we can get!
What's a Gladiator without an Arena to fight in? So get up there and start cracking some skulls! Besides, one more fight and you advance again.
You're a Hero, my friend. That crowd is out there for one reason: to see you destroy the Yellow Team! Now go give 'em what they want!
You're at the end of a long road, Hero. This is the last time you'll face off against the Yellow Team before being named Champion.
Go up to that Arena and make sure the people of Cyrodiil never forget that it was you who brought the Yellow Team to its knees!
You're a Champion now. I've got no more fights for you. If you think you can beat the Gray Prince, challenge him! If anyone can beat him, you can!
Sorry, friend, no time to talk! My friend Saliith and I are training to be combatants in the Arena! It takes a lot of dedication to do what we do.
What? Look, pal, no talkie right now, okay? I'm here to watch people get mutilated, not blab like an old woman.
Step aside.
I'm afraid this area is restricted to Guild mages. You'll have to leave.
What? Do you have business in the House of Dementia?
Welcome to the Inn. If it's a room you're after, speak with Christophe.
Well, that's that. The killer is dead, and this nightmare is just about over. All we have to do now is find a way out of here.
Ah yes, the sixth guest. I'm Neville. It's nice to make your acquaintance.
You're starting to crowd me, friend. Why don't you just back off, eh?
Well, that chest of gold is supposed to be in here somewhere. Though why someone would invite us all here just to give it away is quite the mystery.
You want my honest opinion? This whole setup -- the party, the chest of gold -- it doesn't make any sense.
Why would someone invite us here? Why would they just give away an entire chest of gold? If I didn't know better, I'd say this whole thing is a trap.
So, why am I here? Greed, my friend. I need the gold. I served the Legion proudly for twenty-three years, but pride doesn't put food on my table.
Someone's been killed, and as far as I'm concerned, you're one of the prime suspects. You watch your step.
Locked inside a house with five strangers. It sounded like  a trap when I read the invitation. Looks like I was right!
A guest has been murdered. So it begins. You mark my words. This entire party is a trap. Someone wants us all dead, and now they have their chance.
Well, well, look who's here. It's the number one suspect in the cold-blooded murder of two innocent people. I'm watching you, scum.
I'd say that with two people dead, it's time for everyone to pull together. We need to watch out for each other, stay in a group.
We're being stalked, like animals in the forest. I'm still not sure if the killer is one of the other guests, or is hiding somewhere in the house.
One thing I do know is that the killer won't just stop with two. They never do. You and I, we need to watch each other's backs.
I've got my old Legion armor and sword in a chest upstairs. It's time I geared up and showed this coward just who he's dealing with!
Don't worry, my friend. I'm going to show this slinking cutthroat how the Imperial Legion takes care of things.
Come to have a few words before you slit my throat? That's right, I know you did it. I can't prove it yet, but you mark my words: You're going down!
I've been doing some thinking. About you. It's kind of interesting that you were the last guest to arrive, don't you think?
And now, three people lie dead, and you look as if you haven't a care in the world. It just looks a bit... suspicious. That's all I'm saying.
There you are. Listen, I've searched every inch of this house. It's sealed up tight. There's no way in or out, and there's nobody hiding anyplace.
That means the killer has been inside with us all along. You and I aren't murderers, so that leaves one person! We must prepare to defend ourselves!
That means the killer has been inside with us all along. You and I aren't murderers, so that leaves one person! It's Nels the Naughty!
Well, here we both are. Retired Imperial Legion officer and hired assassin. So, who do you work for? The Dark Brotherhood? The Morag Tong? No matter.
I've faced your kind before. You're a coward. You use stealth and lies to destroy innocent lives. All of that ends now! Prepare to meet your doom!
I was wondering when you'd get to me. I have to give you some credit. You had me fooled. You made me trust you, which is not an easy thing.
Oh, and the chest of gold was a nice touch. I knew it was all too good to be true, but I guess my greed got the best of me.
But I'm afraid your little game is over now. I've killed more assassins in my day than I can count. So let's get this over with!
Well, that's it, my friend. We're the last. And that damned assassin is still hiding out in this house somewhere.
I guess there's only one thing left for me to do. I'm going to find an axe and do my best to chop that damn door down and get us out of here!
Don't you worry, my friend. I'll get us out of here!
Well, they're all taken care of now. I can't believe we lost Elidor and Brag. Head back to gro-Khash. He won't be happy, but these things happen.
Well, they're all taken care of now. It's a damn shame about Elidor. He was a fine swordsman. You should head back to gro-Khash now. Thanks.
Well, they're all taken care of now. It's a shame we lost Brag. I'll miss the ugly bastard. You should head back to gro-Khash now. Thanks.
Well, they're all taken care of now. Good work, there, soldier. Get back to gro-Khash and get your payment.
We've got to clear out all these goblins. I'll let you know when we've gotten the last of them.
Give those weapons to the men, and let's get moving.
You must be the reinforcement from the guild. Good. I hope you brought weapons for us.
What can I do for you? Looking for some work? If so, the Fighters Guild can always use able-bodied new members.
Looking for adventure? The Fighters Guild is a good place to start.
Can't thank you enough for your help. What do you need?
Something you need? We still need work.
You'll keep your nose out of this, if you know what's good for you.
Fools! Now you die!
Welcome to the Chironasium. Can I help you?
You need to help Arvena Thelas with her rat problem. What's on your mind?
So, have you taken care of those thieves yet?
You two are supposed to be taking care of those thieves in Anvil. What is it you need?
Greetings! Looking for some more work, are you?
Ah, our newest pickpocket.
I'm glad you stopped by. I have a... situation that you might be able to help with.
I might have something for you, but we can't talk about it here. Meet me at the usual place, and at the usual time.
Have you recovered those taxes?
So, you've come back.
Yes... you might do.
I really don't have time for the likes of you.
Oh. You again.
Are you confused?
Well, you managed to get Llathasa's bust, and you got Hieronymus Lex off my back. However, you broke the code of the Thieves Guild.
You killed someone in the Chapel, and now you have to pay the blood price. Until you do, you are no longer a member of this guild.
Don't bother to come back until you have it.
With your help I uncovered the informant that had compromised the Thieves Guild.
I know I used you in this matter with the Llathasa's bust, but I couldn't be certain that you weren't working with Myvryna.
Here is the reward you were promised. Even though the bust is gone, you've earned it.
I'm also promoting you to the guild rank of Bandit, which will let you use Dar Jee of Leyawiin as your fence. Good work!
I'm in hiding from the Imperial Watch. Go find Methredhel. She has your instructions.
You've done well for yourself.
Have you found it? Have you brought back the Stone of St. Alessia?
Have you had any luck recovering the Stone of St. Alessia?
Greetings, my friend. You must be from the Fighters Guild. We appreciate your help.
What's the status of the Stone of St. Alessia? Have you returned it to Cirroc yet?
Have you finished out your contract? You need to find that Stone.
Here for more work, are you? I've got one last contract for you. First, though, a bit of bad news. Oreyn spoke with Vilena about your last mission.
She didn't take the news well. Oreyn has been expelled. And, I'm sorry to do this, but you've been demoted to Defender. You'll be fine, though.
There's one last contract.
I'm busy. You got business to discuss, you talk to Eridor.
Yes? Do you have questions about your contract?
You should be helping out Norbert Lelles. What's on your mind?
You must be the cat burglar I've been told to expect. Follow me.
All things speak with the voice of life... even the bones of the earth.
I have mastered my fears. There is no terror to compare with what Vaermina has shown me in my dreams.
We seek what the darkness hides, and the Night Mistress is our guide.
You walk in the shadow of the Corrupter. Why do you come to this place?
I am only a supplicant. Speak to the Dark Elf wearing the robes.
You approach the Shrine of Boethia. Tread lightly.
It's... it's you! I remember you. What are you doing down here? How did you get past the Knights?
When they attacked, I ran from Passwall. They didn't say a word, they just started killing! The screams! By the staff, you can't imagine the screams!
Felas and I slipped down here thinking that we'd be safe. But, no! We landed right in the middle of them!
Felas ran off with them and left me to die! Me! That ingrate! Disloyal cur! Imagine, leaving me here all alone!
Can we get out of here?
I'm going to stay here and help rebuild this place. These fools need me.
It is my honor to serve you.
The... the lady Syl has fallen? Can this be?
I admit I had my doubts about you, but something told me I was doing the right thing. Many thanks.
Don't be fooled, the Ritual isn't over.
The body on the bed isn't Syl, but merely an impersonator. The real Syl uses many such decoys to throw would-be killers off her trail.
Syl has made her escape through the hidden tunnel in the gardens outside her quarters! She must not get away!
Be wary, I fear that her escape may be a ruse to lure you into an ambush.
Please, I have done all I can. There is nothing more to say. Just be cautious.
What is it you require?
Another fine day in Mania, is it not?
How may I assist you, my lord?
How may I assist you, my lady?
Everything is gone. What a shame.
Things are coming along nicely here. Soon enough, they'll have no choice but to do everything I say.
Hello stranger. We don't get many visitors around here. Makes things pretty lonely for me, if you know what I mean.
You make me sick! Now get out of here before I have Manheim throw you out!
Still here, stranger? You're not actually renting a room, are you?
It's good to see you, friend. This inn has been cheerless for far too long.
Words cannot to do justice for the joy I feel... many blessings upon you, my friend. I do not have much, but I wish to reward such valor.
Return to me in three weeks, and I'll have a special painting for you. It is the least I can do for you.
It is with the warmest regards I welcome you again, my friend. But you have returned a bit too early. I should have the painting done soon.
I understand the decision that you have made. And I accept my fate. Now please leave me to my thoughts.
Hello. Are you searching for something?
Hello again. I hope your search for the painting goes well.
Welcome to Chorrol Castle. I am Chanel, the court mage. What brings you to me today?
Excuse me. I need to take these people to the encampment.
The area is clear? Then as soon as Captain Matius gives the order, I'll escort the civilians to safety.
This is our one chance -- don't screw it up for us.
What's it like out there? We were beginning to fear we were the only survivors.
A whole city, just.... lost. How did we let this happen?
Hey, I was up in Cropsford the other day. It looks like they're really making a go of it. You did a good thing there, you know.
Well met! Come, warm yourself by our fire.
Have you seen my friend Luronk? I'm worried about him.
Luronk and I have both testified against the Watch Captain, Hayn. Thank you for helping us find the courage to stand up for ourselves.
I hear that Audens Avidius is going to jail. Let's hope its a long sentence.
Don't be angry at us. This is the only way we could find the place.
A farmhouse? Hmmm, last time it was a cabin. They must be moving around. Just be cautious.
Just hurry back with that ring... please.
We had a feeling you'd be surprised when you saw us in our real uniforms. I see you have a puzzled look on your face. Ask away.
So, they're at Gweden, eh? Good to know. Keep on it.
I knew they would make contact with you. Be careful, there's no telling what they're up to.
Nothing much more I can help with. I'm afraid you'll have to ask Gogan, my lout of a husband, if you need to know anything else.
I'm sure he can provide very highly detailed descriptions of the women.
What can I help with?
I hope you're here to reconsider.
Witches! How dare they prey on our men.
How would you like to get my husband, Gogan, out of hot water?
Back again? You still want to help my good-for-nothing husband?
I can't believe you did that. Maelona is furious.
They still aren't letting me live this down.
We have a lot of paperwork and follow-up investigation to do. Please, leave us to it.
I'm afraid I have very little information to add to our follow-up investigation.
Welcome back, friend. Here is the painting. When you place it in your home and gaze upon it, may you always remember the deed you have done for me.
I am overjoyed at your return. What may I assist you with?
Little busy right now. Got your mess to clean up.
Any word on my Medallion?
Fetid Grove is a dangerous place... please be cautious.
It's good to meet you. The name's Pyke, and I welcome you to my humble home. Please, make yourself comfortable.
Since you're here, I was wondering... do you think you could assist me? I'm having a bit of a crisis.
I hope you can help me with my crisis.
Have you given Malene the gift yet?
Do you have the gift for Malene?
Greetings, traveler. What do you seek?
You are welcome in my home anytime, friend! Maybe one day you'll learn to love it so much, you'll wish to stay here, too.
Welcome to the Horse Whisperer. Are you interested in a horse?
Welcome to the Horse Whisperer.
We don't have any horses for sale right now. You bought our last White horse.
This is one of our finest White horses. Take good care of him.
If you are looking to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Clesa.
I see you work with the Gray Fox.
The thought of what might have happened if you and Martin hadn't stopped Dagon's invasion...
But it's over. Thank Akatosh, the Oblivion Invasion is over, and we've survived!
You are the toast of Anvil, my friend! It may be only a temporary respite, but everyone feels better with that Gate closed.
I'm Ernest. This is the Horse Whisperer, Anvil's only stable. Park your nag here, or leave him for the wolves. Your choice.
I'm Wilbur, owner and proprietor of The Count's Arms. We make beds and food available to guests. Can I help you?
Give yourself to love, pilgrim. I'm Trevaia, priestess of Dibella, and this is Anvil's Chapel of Dibella.
I'm Azzan, head of the Anvil Fighters Guild chapter, and Advanced Blunt Weapons trainer.
Rhano. I'm Anvil's Advanced Trainer in Blade Weapons.
I'm Isolde, mate... not that it's any of your business.
Hi, I'm Gogan. How's it going?
I'm Maelona. Gogan's wife.
I'm Clesa. My husband and I run the Horse Whisperer, the finest stables in Anvil County.
We're all in your debt for closing that Oblivion Gate outside the city. Well done.
I'm Carmen Litte. Perhaps you know my husband? Alberic Litte, the Mages Guild sorcerer? What can I do for you?
I'm Chanel, Chorrol Castle Mage. You'll tell me what you're here for. Right?
Hello. I'm Rasheda -- the smith -- and this is Fire and Steel. Quality armor and weapons, repairs, too. What can I do for you?
Sorry, buddy. I'm with Hides-His-Heart, and I can't be distracted.
Look. I don't want to talk. So leave me alone.
Even a small bit of good news is refreshing in these grim times. I salute your courage, Savior of Cheydinhal!
I'm Trayvond the Redguard, Mages Guild Evoker. Surprised? Yes, you don't see many Redguards in the Mages Guild.
We don't much like spellcasters in Hammerfell. Wizards steal souls and tamper with minds. If you use magic, you're weak or wicked.
My family didn't approve of my vocation, so I had to come to Cyrodiil for my education.
I admit... I still have strong prejudices against necromancy, summoning, and illusion.
Profaning the remains or souls of the dead is just wrong. And I'm uneasy about tampering with other's minds and trafficking with Daedra.
While the Guard hid behind the walls, you took the fight to Oblivion itself! Maybe your example will inspire others.
I'm a fair hand at grapes and bows. Shameer, grower and trainer. But I suspect you want to shoot, not grow grapes. Am I right?
I'm Tamika. We grow our own grapes, and make fine wines.
Borissean. Master Spellmaker for the Mages Guild. Guildsmen, only, of course.
Enchanted to meet you. Delmar, Enchanter Extraordinaire to the Mages Guild! At your service. Got some enchanting in mind?
Welcome to 'A Fighting Chance'. I'm Rohssan, proprietor. I sell the best swords in the City, and I offer Advanced Training for Armorers.
I'm Phintias, owner and proprietor of the First Edition. Look around. If I don't have it, maybe I can get it.
I'm Varnado. I handle the Heavy Armor at 'The Best Defense'. I'm also an Advanced Trainer in Heavy Armor, so I know what I'm talking about.
Winson. I just work for Luther. I don't want no trouble.
Angelie Blakeley. This is my father's house. He was lost at sea, many years ago.
I don't believe I know you. And I don't need any new friends, thank you very much.
Welcome to the All-Saints Inn. I'm Willet, the publican.
I'm Curtis. I'm nobody special.
I'm Ruslan. Not that it's any of your business.
I'm Jair. I'm a dip...
... a pickpocket. But relax. You're safe from me. You look like you might take offense. Too risky.
They call me Isleif the Open-Handed. Because I'm so generous...
... Well, don't expect a handout from ME. You certainly don't need it.
You can call me Hillod the Outlaw. Because I'm on the lam.
To think, it was here at Bruma where the tide finally turned against the Oblivion Invasion!
Now we're counting on you to help Martin claim the throne and put an end to this terrible war. I know you won't fail us.
Everybody's talking about how you and Captain Burd closed that Oblivion Gate outside town. You're a real hero around here!
I'm Cirroc, Bruma's Chapel Healer.
I'm Jearl. I spend most of my time down south, but I keep a house in Bruma for the mountain air.
Thank you for closing that Oblivion Gate. Despite what the Count may say, we're all in your debt.
Hey, baby? You fancy some training? Sherina's the name, and blades are the game.
I am Kithlan, Steward of Lady Syl. Unless you have reason to be here, your presence is unwelcome.
Do you have business in the House of Dementia?
Relan. It is I who kills. It is I who hunts. It is I who keeps the fields and farms clean for Cindanwe.
Clean of vermin. Clean of the things and people who would take our crops and eat them with their nasty nasty teeth.
I wish I had more teeth -- great big fangs on my arms and legs to eat them before they eat us.
Soft flesh... brittle bones... snap snap... Love how they crack.
Orinthal, retired Assassin. Now I live here. Only Redguard here, incidentally. An interesting fact, isn't it? I do enjoy facts.
Hello again. You don't happen to recall how many steps you took in getting here, do you? I was just wondering.
Greetings. Did you know that I slept for exactly 237 minutes last night? I find that fascinating.
Hello there. Have I mentioned that my left arm is actually one inch longer than my right? Never know when that might be important.
So many figures to compile. Would that I had your infinite wisdom, Lord.
I am here to serve, Lord. May I assist in Your great works?
My Lord. I didn't realize how powerful your presence would be. I will try to embody that majesty in my daily life. People respect me, you know.
Hello, I'm Shelden. I've been here the longest. That's why I'm mayor of Passwall. That, and because I'm the best at being in charge.
Welcome to my town!
Yes? You need my help, don't you?
I'll try to speak in fewer syllables.
You're the one who closed the gate? Thank you.
I'm really busy... oh. Sorry. You closed the gate, yes? Thank you. What can I do for you?
What...?
A new Gatekeeper! Excellent. We might be onto something with you, after all. That should keep out the stragglers.
And I see you've learned to summon Flesh Atronachs! Relmyna must like you, little Duchess... but probably not in THAT way.
And I see you've learned to summon Flesh Atronachs! Relmyna must like you, little Duke... but probably not in THAT way.
Yes, little Duchess? I believe I sent you to rebuild my Gatekeeper. If you're too busy, I'm sure Jyggalag will wait....
Yes, little Duke? I believe I sent you to rebuild my Gatekeeper. If you're too busy, I'm sure Jyggalag will wait....
Time. Time is an artificial construct. An arbitrary system based on the idea that events occur in a linear direction at all times.
Always forward, never back. Is the concept of time correct? Is time relevant? It matters not. One way or another, I fear that our time has run out.
As I feared it would, My plan has failed. The Greymarch is upon us, and I must go.
I thought we had more time. I thought we had a chance. My plan has failed. And we were so close....
Wondering why I let her go, aren't you? I can see it in your face. Mostly in the eyes. I may take those from you when this is done.
This has never happened before! The ruler of Dementia turning traitor? Unprecedented! I've seen others defect, but never a Duke!
Maybe we're on to something here. We'll see how it plays out. It can't be worse than what's happened before.
You've done it! The Ritual is complete, and you've survived! A shame about Thadon, but it's how he would have wanted to go. Now, on to other...
You have things to do. Talking to me isn't one of them.
You should be off like the wind, solving problems and doing good deeds!
And if not good deeds, then deeds of a sort. Strongholds to save, and Daedra to rescue. That sort of thing. Now get going.
This is a particularly exciting turn of events, is it not?
A perfect job for you, my newest and only Noble in the realm! If Order has entered my army's stronghold, things have taken a disturbing turn.
It means Order has tried subterfuge... not its strong suit. Amazing! Perhaps things aren't going as poorly as I'd imagined.
You'll want to get all the details from the messenger. Unless you already have. You haven't, have you?
Isn't there something you should be doing right now? You know, for example, the things you were specifically told to do?
A new arrival! A shame about my Gatekeeper. I'm so happy, I could just tear out your intestines and strangle you with them.
I suppose an introduction is in order. I'm Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. And other things. I'm not talking about them.
You've probably figured that out by now. Let's hope so. Or we're in real trouble... and out come the intestines. And I skip rope with them!
But, perhaps now's not the time. You've made it this far. Farther than anyone else. Well done!
Take this trinket of mine. Perhaps it will serve you well. Or look lovely on your corpse.
Well, well. So you've experienced both shades of madness. Wonderful. You seemed fulfilled. Full of fill. Bursting at the seams. Seamless.
Now to the meat of your endeavor. The crux of the situation. The reason for your being here, and the likely cause of your death.
Marvellous, marvellous! Self-immolation is a wonderful thing, isn't it? But now that we've had our fun, off to the Sacellum with you.
I'm almost positive I sent you away to do something important. Cylarne... Flame... Great Torch. Yes... why are you here?
You're back! How nice for you. Does that mean you've made a decision? Or are you lost? Suicidal? Just let me know.
You haven't spoken to both Priests. You'll end up making a stupid decision, and you won't live to regret it. Don't do that.
You're talking to me. You should be talking to the Priests. You can't be doing both, can you? Neat trick if you could.
Aren't you off to a good start! That's important. For me. Really, your work is going to save me a lot of time.
News of your success in the Fringe precedes you. To further cement the victory I have an important task for you to perform.
You will seek the assistance of Relmyna Verenim in Xaselm to rebuild the Gatekeeper. You remember the creature you killed to get in here?
With the Gatekeeper restored and Xedilian in operation, we won't have to worry about anything getting in. Things already here are another matter.
You'll need to speak with Relmyna Verenim. She'll help you with your task. Strange woman. Has some unusual tastes.
With that done, the Fringe should be secure. For now. I can feel things start to get a little hairy. And, not in the good way, like on your head.
Wondering why I let him go, aren't you? I can see it in your face. Mostly in the eyes. I may take those from you when this is done.
This has never happened before! The ruler of Mania turning traitor? Unprecedented! But different is good. A new act in this play.
You've done it! The Ritual is complete, and you've survived! Who'd have thought? Now, on to other...
Good, good! You'll need all the help you can get if you're going to defeat Jyggalag and stop the Greymarch.
Oh, don't expect to summon dear Haskill anywhere but in the Realm. He dislikes leaving My presence. I get that sometimes.
Isn't that a hoot? I love it, myself. Best part of being a Daedric Prince, really. Go ahead, try it again. He loves it!
Just one more time. At least. He's a sport.
Go ahead. Summon him. He loves it.
Well now, what news do you have to report?
Don't you have a book to read? Or something else very important I've told you to do?
Greetings! Salutations! Welcome! Now go away. Leave. Run. Or die.
I'm sorry, but I'm late for an appointment. I've no time to talk now.
You must not have heard me the first time. Good day!
Are you deaf? Leave me alone!
Yes, I'm the city's Arena Gatekeeper, but I'm not on duty now. If you want to bet on a fight, see me at the Arena between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM.
Don't you have a fight scheduled? I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to bet on your own match! You'd best get into the Arena!
Hello there! Welcome to the Arena! I don't think I've ever seen you around here before. I know all the regulars, believe me.
If you're looking to join the Arena as a combatant, you need to head down to the Bloodworks and talk to Owyn, the Blademaster.
If you're here to bet on a fight, on the other hand, you're talking to the right man! There are matches all day long, from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM.
That's a lot of chances to fill your purse with coin. So what do you say: you want to bet on a match?
You'd better get up to the Arena or you'll miss the match! Just head through those doors on my left. If you win, come see me to collect your gold.
Ah, sorry friend, but it would appear the opponent you bet on lost that last fight. Better luck next time!
You won! Congratulations! Here are your winnings, my friend -- 200 gold pieces. Come back and bet on the matches as often as you like!
You won! Congratulations! Here are your winnings, my friend -- 100 gold pieces. Come back and bet on the matches as often as you like!
You won! Congratulations! Here are your winnings, my friend -- 50 gold pieces. Come back and bet on the matches as often as you like!
Ah, another happy spectator! You of course want to bet on a fight! Who will it be this time, the Blue Team or the Yellow Team?
Wow! You're the Grand Champion! I saw your fight against the Gray Prince!  You're the best! Can I... Can I follow you around? I won't get in the way!
Yes, oh great and mighty Grand Champion? Is there something you need? Can I carry your weapon? Shine your boots? Backrub, perhaps?
Why do I come to the Arena? Honestly? I love the way the combatants move. It's like an... an erotic dance. The bodies, the sweat, the... oh. I, um...
I'm here on business, and you're not part of it. Take a hike.
I have seen what you have done, child, and how you must make amends with the guild.
Seek out Raminus Polus at the Arcane University. He alone can open the guild to you again.
Why did you come here? Why do you still do the bidding of that prattling fool?
When I swore allegiance to Jyggalag, my eyes were opened.
I saw who my true enemies were for the first time.
Order's time has come. The Greymarch is upon you.
Why did you come here? Why do you still do the bidding of that prattling madman?
When I bowed the knee to Jyggalag, my eyes were opened.
All that had come before - meaningless. Pointless frivolity.
My lord Jyggalag has given me clarity, and purpose.
Ah, you again! A pleasure, I'm sure. No time for chatter now; I have a few important things to attend to, or did I? Ah well...
The Blood of Thadon has been consumed by Arden-Sul's will, and all of Mania welcomes you with open arms.
I now declare you Duchess of Mania of the Shivering Isles! May your light shine upon all our happiest days.
I now declare you Duke of Mania of the Shivering Isles! May your light shine upon all our happiest days.
Sheogorath sent for me and I have arrived. That's all I know.
You see now what happens when those who oppose me fail, which they always do.
I am pleased with your work, Inquisitor. As a token of my appreciation, I shall spare your life, and make you a Courtier of Dementia.
In addition, accept this Bow. May your enemies fear you and never know from where or with what enchantment you shall strike.
We shall speak when we've reached the chamber.
What news do you have to report, Inquisitor? Have you found who is responsible?
I trust you have reconsidered your position. Are you now ready to help me?
Why do you approach the Duchess of Dementia? Do you seek death?
The triumphant champion returns!
So, do you feel any different? Now that you've been through this experience, I mean.
You know what it's like now... Always wanting that next fix, hating it but craving it at the same time, and hating yourself for all of it.
Ah, well. All over now. The Chalice helps, doesn't it? Indeed it does, and I could use some helping right now. I'll just take that back from you.
And as a token of my gratitude, I grant you the role of Courtier of Mania, with all of its entitlements.
Which is to say, none.
Well, look at you. A change for the better, or for the worst? We'll have to see, won't we?
Didn't we have this conversation already? Or was that someone else... No, it was me. And you. And so you know what you should be doing right now.
The Chalice, remember? Don't forget, because if I forget then no one will remember, and it might cease to exist. Reality is fickle like that.
Ahh yes, THERE you are! You couldn't imagine how long I've been waiting for you. So little to do, and so much time.
Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong. I might also not care. Which is it?
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you're here. We have work to do.
Hello there. Is there something I can do for you?
Ah, child. I thank you for helping me.
With the voices quieted for now, the words you seek have come to me. You shall have my... recommendation.
Though I must warn you. I have seen things in your future. Things which may be, and things which will be.
It will be up to you to decide the fate of many. Life and death are strange things, easily manipulated, and both will be altered by your hands.
You seek more from me, child? It is as I have seen.
I know what you would ask. You would bring light to that which is in darkness, bring silence to the voices so loud. I know where you must go.
Blood ran blue, and dragons flew high. Under broken towers and broken bodies it now lies, waiting to be found.
What was my sire's must be mine, if you would have the words you seek. You must go and find his stone.
Nothing has changed, child. The voices still cry out, and I am unable to hear. If they can be sealed away, our work may begin.
Have you reconsidered, child? Will you aid me?
You seek wisdom from me, child? Ah, no. You seek words.
Words are... difficult. They come and go. The voices, though. So loud they are, they drown out the words.
Without my amulet, my stone to lock the voices away, the words will never come and stay.
Would you lift your hands to help another, to help me find the words?
You speak, yet I cannot hear. You listen, yet I cannot speak. When the voices grow quiet, then shall our time be at hand.
Agata has heard the voices, though I speak for them all. It is to her you must now go.
I hope we'll get to Skingrad soon. I've had enough of the wilderness for now.
They're all gone? I can leave the cave? Oh, thank you! I'm ever so grateful!
You're heading back to Skingrad, aren't you? Could I... maybe come with you? It'd be safer, I think. So, what do you say?
You... how did you get in here? Are those horrible creatures gone?
I'm not going anywhere until they're gone! Horrible things!
Are the creatures gone? I want to get out of here. I've been trapped for days!
I don't dare move a muscle until they're all dispatched!
Greetings, child. The Mages Guild has a future for you, I believe. I have seen it. You should consider joining.
Huh? You're not Gromm. Who are you? Why are you in my home?
Don't be shy. Join us, and do well by doing good.
You're still around? I've told you why I defaulted on the contract. Not too much else to be said about it. Do what you must.
What is it... brother? They send you to find me?
What is it... sister? They send you to find me?
Got nothing else to say to you. Get out of here before I get angry.
You again. I imagine I know why you're here, guild rat.
You! You've ruined everything! Why? WHY? I had a job! I had a home! You've taken it all! I'll kill you for this!
We're done here. Let's go get paid.
Oh, it's you. Looks like we're working together.
Come on. Let's get this mission done and get paid.
Don't try to slow me down. I'm going to get that diary before you.
Thief! You stole that diary from me. Now I have to wait to get into the guild.
So you are looking for the Thieves Guild as well. Armand Christophe will decide who is worthy and who is not.
I've been preparing to join the guild for years. If you're nice to me, maybe I'll show you a few tricks.
I've got the diary, and I will turn it over to Armand the next chance I get.
It's well hidden, so don't even think about trying to steal it back from me!
I'm... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong! It was the robed man! He... he paid me to put those things in the barrel!
I don't know his name, and his face was in shadow. He called to me yesterday as I walked by the lighthouse. I think he lives there!
Or he did, anyway. He told me he was leaving Anvil. I'm sorry, but that's all I know!
I hope you're not too angry with me. I... I never meant to do anything wrong, honest!
Thank goodness I found you. I assume you know that Hieronymus Lex has issued an arrest warrant for Armand Christophe.
I'm rather busy on a... I'm busy. What do you need?
Oh, no. Not another one.
Ahem. Citizen of... Skingrad. Please be advised that I am here on official business, and wish no harm...
... Oh, forget it. Let me guess: you're worried about what my men and I are doing here in town, right?
Good to see you again, friend. I don't suppose you've noticed anything out of the ordinary around here?
Oh, you again. What do you want?
Hello again, citizen.
Excuse me, citizen.
You? What are you doing here?
You've got the gem?
Get it back to Traven immediately, or else this whole attack was a waste!
Get the gem! The leader probably had it - that High Elf.
All right. I'm ready; keep your eyes peeled. They could come out at any moment.
And don't move until you have to. We don't want to lose our advantage.
You're in charge. Let us know what positions we should take up, but be quick about it. The Necromancers could come out of there any time now.
This is it. The entrance to Silorn is just ahead.
We've been watching the site for a while, and have tried to stay out of sight ever since the original plan was blown.
We were supposed to storm the place and take this gem they're holding. Only we can't. There's some sort of enchantment on the door.
With that door sealed, there's no way we're getting inside, so we'll have to wait for them to come out.
Based on the activity I've seen, that should be very soon.
We'll talk when we're closer, so I can show you what we're facing. Not now.
You're here from the Council, aren't you?
Traven sent you? Just you?
That helps the odds, but not much. We're still going to be outnumbered. Follow me; I'll show you what we're up against.
I have a message for you from the Gray Fox.
I wouldn't keep him waiting if I were you.
The Gray Fox seems very anxious to see you. Go inside.
It all feels good. It's all fun. Why not?
Talk to Hjolfrodi. I can't help you.
I'm not the one you want to talk to.
This ground is sacred. Show respect.
I played Lord Vile's game, and lost my soul. Small loss, I think.
There is nothing more to say. Leave me.
I assume you've made your choice. Umbra hungers. What shall it be?
You risk much by speaking to me. You should leave this place. Now.
You've brought it! The holy Flame of Agnon, the fire of Inspiration and Rapture!
If you light the Great Torch on the Mania side of the Sacellum, you will be a hero to the people of Bliss, I assure you!
Are you ready to repent of your actions in Cylarne, and light the Great Torch for Mania?
So, you've decided to light the Torch for Mania?
Light the Great Torch! Let the Maniacal dance of the flames blaze out across the realm!
What? What is it? Very busy. Things to do. Or see. Or something.
You are not a member of the society. Watch if you must, but don't get in the way.
Please leave! These are private moments!
Visit me during store hours. These are private moments.
They call me Cutter. For a truly inspired blade, I can forge Madness Ore! Here. Hold onto this parchment. It lists what I need.
Something smooth and sharp? Leave your foes sticky with blood.
I do delicate things with Madness Ore. It tingles across the flesh when it cuts.
You remain faithful. That is good. I will cut your throat if you visit that other smith.
You have been unfaithful. His blades are dull and uninspired. Mine are sharp and exquisite.
Do you enjoy it? Cutting my heart? Why visit that other smith?
Why visit that other smith? Piercing flesh with my blades doesn't satisfy you?
Happy times and happy days, my lord!
Happy times and happy days, my lady!
Everything is just so... desolate. My inn is ruined and... oh, it's terrible...
You'd think that after all this work, I'd finally be able to get some sleep.
I'm disappointed in your choice. Why you would choose to honor the fetid madness of Dementia is beyond my understanding.
The Great Torch shines with the pure light of Mania! You chose well!
In accordance with the ancient tradition, receive now the Raiment of Arden-Sul in honor of your mighty deed in service to Mania.
Dervenin, High Priest of Mania at your service. What brings you to this holy place on such a fine day?
You chose well. The Great Torch shines as a beacon of Mania to inspire and enflame all who gaze upon it!
What else can I help you with on this glorious day?
Warmest welcomes to you. I am Telaendril, Wood Elf and loyal daughter of Sithis. I hope you find our Sanctuary to your liking.
Hello, Brother. It's good to see you again. The Night Mother has been smiling upon you, I hope.
Hello, sweet Sister. It warms my heart to see you again. The Night Mother has been smiling upon you, I hope.
Hello, Brother. How can I help you?
Hello, Sister. Can I help you with something?
I find your very presence foul. Say what you will and then leave my sight!
I'm sorry, but I'm really not one for engaging in conversation. Please, leave me.
Hmm? Oh, Caenlin's my name. Maybe you knew my uncle, Baenlin? He died recently. Stuffed head fell on him. Very tragic. Well, goodbye.
Hmm? Oh, Caenlin's my name. Maybe you knew my uncle, Baenlin? He died recently. It was all very tragic. I'm heartbroken, of course. Well, goodbye.
Ah, you came. You're sure you weren't followed? Good, I thought I could trust you. Nobody else in town. They're all in on it ... all watching me.
Well.  Yes.  I need you to do something for me.  I'll pay you -- gold.  You like gold, don't you?  Lots of gold.
Here's my problem. I'm being followed. Watched. Marukhati Selectives, maybe. Not sure. I'm a threat, you see? To their plans. I know too much.
I need you to check out some people for me, the ones that are following me.  Watch them, see where they go, who they report to. Will you help me?
So, you saw Bernadette Peneles, did you?  She WAS watching me and following me, wasn't she?
Tell me what you learned about Toutius Sextius.
So, what did you discover about the upstanding Davide Surilie?
Have you... done... what I asked?
You said you wanted me to solve this myself. And I am. Drastic measures. Didn't want to, but you're right, it is the only way.
Um, no, I don't know the way to the Imperial City.  You'll have to ask someone else.
You fool!  You'll ruin everything!  We can't be seen talking together!
We can't be seen talking!  I waited for you last night behind the Great Chapel, where WERE you?!  I'll meet you there tonight.
Yes, the Gold Road does pass through Skingrad.  I, too, find it fascinating.
I told you not to speak to me in public! We'll meet tonight, at the place we discussed.
Ah, sorry, I have no idea what time it is.
Were you able to stop Agarmir?
Why are you following me? Please... go away. I'm quite busy.
What kind of deal can I make for you today?
1, 2, 3. I need my arrows. 5, 7, 11. I can't get them. 13, 17, 19. If I leave, who will keep up the count? 23, 29, 31.
3, 1, 4. Without any arrows, I am useless in this battle. 1, 5, 9. But if I leave to get them, who will count? 2, 6, 5.
1, 2, 3. My arrows are finding their targets! 4, 5, 6.
You should return what you have stolen.
Prior Dreth has tasked me to pray for Vitharn's safety.
My collection is complete! My collection is complete! Glory days! Wheeeeee.
So, you have the pearls? Or perhaps any other things of value I can have -- I mean, hold for you?
Well, hello there. It's good to see such a well-equipped individual as yourself around these parts.
But you look tired. Carrying all that gear will do that to you. I'd be glad to shoulder some of the burden... relieve you of that expensive stuff.
Or is there something else I can take from -- I mean, help you with?
Why do you bother me, stranger? You make far too much noise.
Leave me to my work, stranger.
Nicely done. You want training from me, you've got it.
Didn't I tell you no weapons allowed? Clearly this isn't important to you. We're done here.
I told you not to drop your shield! We're done here.
Fribble, just frib... Wait. You can understand me? Lovely! It's been too long since I was able to have a nice chat with someone.
What a pleasant surprise. Previously, it was only poor Big Head who seemed to understand me. And he's always in such a lather about that Fork.
Do you long for a blade? To cut with? Yes?
I'll Kalicrak the Findoo. I will. You Terratet it!
Fimmion hungry. Got food? Sweetcakes? Sausages?
Wanna buy a stick? I gotta fresh one right here. No? Then what can I do for ya?
I don't belong here. I'm not crazy. Not like the rest of them. They watch me, you know. Waiting for me to go crazy. But I won't. Nope.
Welcome to the Flowing Bowl. I'm Maenlorn. My twin's name is Caenlorn. How to tell us apart? I'm in brown. He's in blue. Simple, really.
I'm Maenlorn. I'm the twin in brown, remember?
Welcome to the Flowing Bowl. I'm Caenlorn, the one in blue. My twin Maenlorn is the brown one. Can we rent you a bed?
Okay. Guess who I am. Caenlorn? Or Maenlorn?
Enilroth, Morvayn's apprentice.
Me? I'm just Laralthir. I wish I were the Countess of Anvil, to tell you the truth. That Millona Umbranox, she's got it made... [Sigh.]
I'm Dairihill, steward of Castle Anvil. We do things differently in Anvil. And the difference shows in the comfort and trust of its people.
I'm Baeralorn, Anvil's castle mage. Perhaps you've heard of my work on magical resistances.
Huurwen of the Fighters Guild. Health and fortune.
I greet you. Thaurron, Journeyman of the Mages Guild.
I don't know you, you don't know me, everybody's happy.
I'm Thurindil, son of Julianos and Mohi-Titona, Queen of Akavir. These slugs climbing my spine itch something fierce. Like to dance?
I'm Hasathil, Heinrich Oaken-Hull's wife.
A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Athragar of the Mages Guild. How can I serve you?
Uurwen the Evoker. I'm responsible for enchanted item recharge for the Cheydinhal guildhall.
Ganredhel. I train dogs. And people. Prefer dogs.
People, I teach them Advanced Acrobatics. Up and jump. Dogs, I teach them to bite people.
I'm Parwen of the Fighters Guild. I'm not a great archer, but I seem to have a knack for teaching. And I've bagged my share of goblins.
It is all in the nose. Yes, of course, it is also in the mouth!
The fragrance, the sharp, startling odor... the sheep's cheese... ambrosia! Nectar!
Yes. I am the Shepherd, Uuras. And it is my sheep, and my deft hand and sharp nose, which produce the glorious cheeses of Skingrad.
Welcome to the Orrery. I'm Bothiel, and the Orrery is my baby.
You're in Rindir's Staffs. And I'm Rindir. I sell magical staffs. Imagine that.
Thoronir welcomes you to The Copious Coinpurse. Such a pleasure. How can I serve you?
I'm Gelephor, the watchman. I keep an eye on things.
I'm Mandil. I'm a lady of leisure, but I do some Advanced Training in Security. Just a hobby, of course.
Thamriel of Tamriel. What are all those strange creatures in the garden? Where are all the white birds?
My name is Elragail. I look after Thamriel. He's a little strange. 'Touched by the Gods', they say.
My name is Hagaer. I don't get out much. Too many books to read.
My name is Methredhel. I've come to the Imperial City to make my fortunes.
I'm Adanrel. I'm discouraged.
My name is Carwen. Remember. I'll be rich and famous one day.
You'll always get a fair deal here. I'm Nilawen. What can I get you?
The Archer's Paradox. Because a perfect arrow flies forever, and that's impossible. I'm Daenlin, and I have no perfect arrows.
Gundalas guarantees! Everything... almost free! At Best Goods and Guarantees, retail service at warehouse prices!
Brodras of the Fighters Guild. I don't do contracts much. Mostly I'm a trainer. Heavy Armor.
And look. No jokes about the Heavy Armor, eh? Not every Bosmer sneaks around with bows and arrows. I'm as tough and beefy as any Orc. Got it?
I'm Cingor. I'm the Captain of the Leyawiin Neighborhood Watch.
Actually, Captain, President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Sergeant-at-Arms.
We're a small, select organization of crime fighters. We're going after the crimes and criminals the Guard overlooks.
I am Sister Angrond of Gottlesfont Priory. We gather and prepare healing herbs and mushrooms.
Why, hello there! I'm Brithaur! It's a pleasure to meet someone who doesn't judge me so harshly. The people here, they have some ideas about me.
But you, you seem so pleasant! And dressed so well! You must have a very full purse. Very full indeed. You are a very fortunate soul.
Well, I've got to be going -- many treasures to find around here, yes indeed! We'll speak again, I'm sure!
It's you again! I'm so pleased to see you! Look at what you have! Is this new? Let me get a closer look! Exquisite!
It's you again! I'm so pleased to see you!
Have you caught my act yet? I'm Thaedil, the juggler. I'm sure you've heard of me.
Oh, who am I kidding? More likely you came to scoff at the worst juggler in the world.
Did you see that? Twelve balls in the air at once! No one has EVER juggled that many at once.
Is there anything more pathetic than a clumsy juggler? Don't even look at me!
Once I've perfected my act, I'll be the toast of the Realm!
Don't be shy. I'm really very approachable. You wanted an autograph, is that it?
I'm awful. Just awful! Why I became a juggler I'll never know. My mother pushed me into it.
You saw my last show, and came to mock me, right? Don't worry, I already know. I disgust myself.
Are you... you are, aren't you? The Madgod! No... I must be dreaming again.
Lord! How may I serve You? Do You require a sharp blade to bleed your enemies?
Your stick is a lot nicer than mine, Sheogorath.
Someday I hope you will invite me to eat with you in the palace, Lord Sheogorath.
Why does everyone in this city look at me like I'm speaking gibberish?
Lord Sheogorath! I would love to put on a show for you some time.
Hello, I'm Dredhwen. No one was running this place when I got here. They left plenty of things behind, though. What do you need?
Excuse me, I must have nodded off there.
Huh-what?
Oh, hello there. Were you standing there for very long? I didn't notice you.
I don't really feel comfortable talking to you right now.
Leave me alone!  I can't talk right now!
Yes, I think ... no.  Wait.  Never mind.  I must go now.
You've done us a great service, stranger. We're all grateful.
Welcome to Kvatch. We've had a spot of trouble, as you can see. But I'm open for business.
Yes, I can understand your trepidation. For it is not everyday one is invited to join the ranks of the undead, eh?
If you ever change your mind, fear not. My offer will always be open. Simply return and speak to me about the Dark Gift, and we can proceed.
Most excellent! Here is what you must do. Simply go to sleep here in the Sanctuary, at any time, and I will visit you as you slumber.
I will wrap you in vampirism's dark embrace. You'll never even know I was there. But when you awaken, we will be of the same blood.
Once infected with vampirism, you must wait three days and then sleep once more. Then the Dark Gift will truly take hold. Sleep now, and awake anew!
Ah, most excellent! Here is what you must do. Simply go to sleep here in the Sanctuary, at any time, and I will visit you as you slumber.
I was stricken with vampirism three-hundred years ago, while on an expedition deep into the Ashlands of Vvardenfell.
For nearly a hundred years I hunted in secret, until the Dark Brotherhood found me. Now I have a family that accepts and even values my unique gifts.
Perhaps in the future, when I feel you have earned the right, I will offer you a chance to become a hunter of the night.
It is good that we've taken care of them, though they smell worse dead than alive.
Filthy animals. Some of my kinsmen are partial to them, but I find them reprehensible.
Lots of them dead, just like it should be.
Only good goblin is a dead goblin. I like dead goblins.
Looks like we got them all. Good work, soldier. The miners will be able to get back to work. You should head back to Burz and find another contract.
There are still more out there; I swear I can hear them. Be on your guard.
Horrible creatures, and they've made this mine too dangerous for the workers. We're going to have to get rid of them.
To prove he is the true heir, an emperor must first light the dragonfires in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.
Only the true heir can light the dragonfires, and if he has the Amulet of Kings.
Akatosh, the Supreme God of Time, gave the Amulet of Kings to St. Alessia, the first emperor, as a god-certain test of the true heir.
The Great God of All made a covenant with St. Alessia. So long as a true heir ruled the Empire, the Great God swore to protect the Empire.
The very foundation of the Empire is the bond between god and emperor.
That a false heir might be crowned... that the test of the Great God might have failed... My heart fails me. It is unthinkable.
You're right. We must try to recover the Amulet before the enemy takes it out of our reach.
You should go back to the Imperial City. Baurus may have learned something about the assassins.
You'll find Baurus at Luther Broad's Boarding House in the Elven Gardens district of the Imperial City.
The Amulet of Kings is the key to everything now.
Once we have it back, Martin can use it to light the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One, and reseal the barriers between Oblivion and our world.
It will be safest here with me. When you return with Martin, we will figure out our next move.
I fear that the Amulet was the target of this attack. Go and see if it is safe!
With the Amulet taken by the enemy, we must get Martin to safety at Cloud Ruler Temple.
All practitioners of daedric magic are familiar with the almost impenetrable barrier between our world and Oblivion.
What the Emperor told you implies that the Amulet is the key to the preservation of that barrier.
What I saw at Kvatch... everything I know about daedric magic says that such stable portals are impossible.
Yet those gates to Oblivion existed. The old rules no longer apply. Kvatch is only the beginning of what Mehrunes Dagon will do.
If the Amulet is truly the key to restoring the barriers between our world and Oblivion, you must waste no time in recovering it.
The sacred symbol of the Empire. Only those of Septim blood can wear it, they say.
I am glad to hear that he survived. A small bit of good news in these dark times. But he will take the Emperor's death very hard.
He will not be forgotten. He goes to Aetherius to join the other fallen heroes of the Blades.
I thank you for recovering his sword. I will set it in a place of honor in the Great Hall of Cloud Ruler Temple.
He served with honor. No Blade could ask for higher praise.
One of the youngest Blades ever to serve in the Emperor's personal guard.
I am glad to hear that he survived, but I fear he will take the Emperor's death particularly hard.
I'm glad to have Baurus here. He guards Martin night and day. His way of atoning for the death of Emperor Uriel, I suppose.
Yes, he lives here near Chorrol, at Weynon Priory. Leave the town gate, look southeast down the Black Road. You can't miss it.
You're welcome.
An old cleric with that name comes in now and then. Lives southeast of town on the Black Road at Weynon Priory.
He sleeps here in the Priory House.
He's usually praying in the Priory chapel at this time of day.
You'll most likely find him in the library.
I think he was in the Chapel praying. I haven't seen him since they attacked.
He'll be sleeping, like anyone with a lick of sense... in the Priory House.
If he's not sleeping or eating, he'll be fussing with his books, I reckon, over in the Priory House.
He sleeps with us here in the Priory House.
Oh. Yes. He'll be in the Priory House somewhere.
Brother Jauffre? He should be in the Priory House, I think.
If he's not in the Priory House, you may find him praying in the chapel.
A great man, and a true believer, deep in faith and wisdom.
He's not part of our community here, but a resident of Weynon Priory, the monastery southeast of town.
The old fellow? At Weynon Priory? It's a small community outside the walls, southeast of the Chorrol gate, on the Black Road.
He's the Grandmaster of the Blades. As the eyes and ears of the Emperor, the Blades don't advertise themselves.
We of the Imperial Bodyguard are the public face of the Blades, but most of my brothers serve the Emperor quietly, behind the scenes.
You'll find Grandmaster Jauffre at Weynon Priory, living as a simple monk.
Hello? Did you hear me? I asked if you needed anything. Well then, I've got duties to tend to, so if you'll excuse me.
My mother? Oh, do you know her? She's such a sweet woman. I've been a terrible daughter I'm afraid. I simply must visit more often!
Anyway, I have duties to tend to. If you see my mother, tell her I'll visit soon! I promise!
Oh, do you now? Well then, far be it for me to deny you such a reasonable request. Guards, I need assistance! This person is resisting arrest!
Hmm. All right, then. You're not one for talking. I can respect that. Well, if you need anything, you just let me know.
My mother? No! What have you done to her! I'll kill you! Agghh!
Kill me? What is this? Who are you? I don't know who sent you, but you won't take me down without a fight! So go ahead, make your move!
Oh-kaaay... Well then, I'm going to go about my business. And stop staring at me, would ya? You're giving me the creeps!
Slave of WHAT? Oh, all right, then! You're some kind of crazy, is that it? Come here then! Show me what you've got!
What? A dead man? You got some kind of death wish, is that it?
Oh. Well... all right, then. I guess I'll be going about my business. Goodbye.
What? Excuse me? Did... did you say die? My... my children? No... No! Don't hurt my precious babies! I won't let you!
My children? Whatever for? Oh! Oh, dear, excuse an old woman's stupidity! You're here to pick up my gift list!
Using your gift service was the smartest thing I've ever done. My children are spread across Cyrodiil, and it's so hard to shop for them all!
So, here's the list of all my precious little ones, though I dare say they're not so little anymore! Ha ha ha ha ha! They grow up so fast, I swear!
You'll notice that the list gives each child's location and some suggestions for gifts. Oh, and here's the gold I'm supposed to give you.
Now please go. Those children are so dear to me, and I'd really like you to get them something special. Thanks again!
A most interesting text, is it not? We are fortunate that at least one necromancer took the time to record the information.
I am unfamiliar with the "Shade of the Revenant" described within the book, but I was never one to dabble in the more, shall we say, amoral arts.
You may take that with you for now, if you wish. The Council may have use for it. Please ask them to return it quickly, as I may need it again.
I believe you'll find it quite helpful. Once you've had a chance to read it, I'd be happy to discuss it with you.
Excellent work. I believe this will be of use to the Council. I shall make sure they're made aware of its contents.
Hmm. I have never heard of this "Shade of the Revenant." Some sort of celestial phenomenon?
If that's correct, then Bothiel would be most likely to know something about it, as the caretaker of the Orrery. She should be on University grounds.
Her expertise in arcane knowledge and lore could be invaluable to us, if we can make proper use of it.
She can likely be found in the Archives now, poring through materials on Necromancy. She stops only to sleep, at the Arch-Mage's request.
Like I said, she's one of the brains over at the Arcane University. Supposed to know everything there is to know about daedric cults.
I shall be here when you are ready.
Excellent. You have become most reliable, and I assure you that the Council appreciates it. Now, to the matter at hand.
In order to deal with the apparent growing problem of Necromancers in Cyrodiil, the Council needs as much information as possible.
The Mystic Archives have been consulted with minimal success. Guild members are investigating other avenues, but I believe more can be learned here.
Maybe Theranis will return soon, maybe not. If you grow bored and change your mind, ask me again.
That is good. Go to Skingrad. The trail starts there.
A fine study to add to my research. I thank you for your help.
I appreciate all of your help. Thank you.
It is a marvelous example of a shrine. Let's be on our way, though.
Yes, let's investigate! And keep on your toes!
My research shows there is likely a shrine in these caves. I'll need you to accompany me to the shrine, handle any... difficulties.
That's what Elante is studying. Make sure she's safe while she does it.
I am Elante of Alinor.
Elante is a scholar, interested in researching Daedra worship. Meet her in Brittlerock Cave, help her find the shrine, and keep her safe.
So, Falcar expressed interest in this Revenant as well, and left this note behind, did he? Perhaps we should look into it for more clues.
This lists several locations. The first is "The Dark Fissure," which I recognize; it's a cave in the mountains south of Cheydinhal.
If there is indeed an altar there, as the note suggests, I believe this cave is directly related to the contents of the book.
Go to the Dark Fissure the next time this "shade" occurs. Search for any connection to what we've learned, and report back.
Please, be careful. Anything you find is of no use to us if you do not survive. I believe we are dealing with powerful forces here.
Do not put yourself in harm's way, if it can be avoided.
I'm afraid I've told you all I can about it. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more use.
Revenant, you say? And it represents something in the Heavens? It sounds familiar. Let me think...
Ah, yes! Now I remember!
Falcar was here some time ago, asking about just such a thing. Said it was for research. He had a large sheaf of notes with him about it.
I'm afraid I didn't have any more advice for him than I do for you. With the Orrery in such a state of disrepair, I have no point of reference.
Falcar did leave this behind; I think it fell from his notes as he left. I didn't pay it much attention, but perhaps it will be of use to you.
Chanel and Orgnolf both reside in the Private Quarters section. They have been restricted to remain indoors, so they should be easy to find.
You may also want to speak to Bittneld, the Captain of the Guard. He can be found on patrol in Chorrol or in the Barracks.
Finally, I would try speaking to Orok gro-Ghoth who is my Steward. He resides in the Private Quarters section as well.
If he isn't in the castle, he may be at the Northern Goods and Trade buying food to stock our larder.
The Countess is in attendance. Proper etiquette is expected.
The Countess is in attendance from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening.
If you wish to seek audience with her, please return at these times. You are also welcome to wait in the seating area near the entrance. Good day.
It's not far from here. Here, I'll mark it on your map. Now, just leave me.
From all accounts, there were four or five of them, and they've been seen heading east on the road. Please, find the Stone of St. Alessia.
I've told you all I know. Leave me alone.
We stole it. I won't try to hide that now. I'm all that's left now, though. We may have stolen the stone, but we weren't the last ones to do it.
The lot of us got jumped by a bunch of ogres. Partial to pretty gems, it seems. I'm the only one that survived. If you want the stone, head to Sedor.
Ahh... you've found it! I can't thank you enough. Your work is greatly appreciated. Here, take these. I wish I could give you more.
You say you've found it, but you no longer have it? What madness is this? Please, you must return it to us immediately!
It's said the Stone was blessed by Alessia herself, and while it remains in our possession, no harm may come to our church.
The relic was stolen from us not long ago. A group of men was seen leaving the Chapel the night the stone was stolen. We believe they were bandits.
I don't know if you're religious, but a lot of folks are, and the Stone is important. Talk to Cirroc in Bruma. He'll fill you in on the details.
The cavern is silent once more. I would be foolish to think that this might send a message to those who would encroach on my territory.
What do you wish to know about it?
No one like that staying here, I can assure you. I don't want that kind of clientele.
Of course, I wouldn't put it past the Orcs over at the Two Sisters Lodge to rent them a room.
You convinced them to leave, I see. A wise plan.
More hunters will come in time, I am sure. For now, Skingrad is quiet again, and you have my thanks.
A troublesome lot. I expect you to deal with them.
Aye, they're staying here. Won't say how long they'll be in town, but as long as they keep payin', I ain't too worried.
Eridor's the chap in charge. I've talked to him and Shamar; didn't catch the names of the other two. They'll be back around midnight, I think.
A smelly lot, if you ask me, but their gold is as good as anyone else's. We can wipe down the rooms afterwards.
They're in here to eat every afternoon, and bed down just before midnight. Outside of that, it's none of my business.
I have told you all that I know. Mannimarco has come to Cyrodiil, and I believe he means harm to your guild. Traven must know this.
Even I know that some from your guild have defected to join him. I believe you can be trusted, as you have been attacked once already.
Perhaps it is a mistake to make that assumption; only time will tell, I suppose.
Your guild does not fully appreciate the danger which quickly approaches. Hopefully when you return to them, their eyes will be opened.
The Necromancers are a sign of things to come. An old acquaintance of the guild has come to Cyrodiil, and they are answering his call.
While I do not know for quite what purpose he has arrived, I believe the Guild of Mages is in great danger. Mannimarco has returned.
Nearly invincible, he has established himself somewhere in the north of Cyrodiil. This is all that I know.
See to it that your leader, Traven, learns this as soon as possible. I have no love for your guild, but I have no wish to see it destroyed either.
I have called you here because from our previous encounter, I believe you can be trusted.
Consider the implications of that, as you handle a small matter for me.
Surprised? Nothing is for free, mage.
There is a small nuisance I would have you deal with before I tell you what I know. One good turn deserves another, after all.
You've already told me all that I need to know.
If you know anything, it is in your best interest to tell me now. After all, your town is at stake!
Do you know where the vampires are?
Please, prepare yourself as quickly as possible.
Count Hassildor of Skingrad has contacted the Council. He claims to have information that is vital to us.
He has requested that you personally travel to Skingrad to obtain this information.
I cannot stress how important it is that our relationship with Hassildor be preserved. I expect you to visit him immediately.
Now that the secret door is open, the manor is quiet; perhaps the curse has been lifted. You should check.
I hope that whatever's behind the door will truly lift the curse. I'd hate to risk harm for nothing.
According to the diary entry, it seems that I'm the only one who can open the secret door in the manor.
And I can't help feeling slightly guilty selling you the place under these circumstances. I'll meet you in Anvil at The Count's Arms.
From there we'll try to lift the curse together.
I'm sorry; I can't help you with the curse. You bought the house; you'll have to deal with it.
May his soul finally rest in peace.
Lorgren Benirus was a strange old man, always dabbling and experimenting with magic.
He was mostly harmless, until the fateful day he came across a tome bearing the evil magic of necromancy.
He became obsessed and decided that by using necromancy, he could prolong his own life.
The dark arts contained in the tome called for him to dig up the recently deceased in the nearby crypts under the cathedral.
When it was discovered that he did this, the Mages Guild called for a quick meeting to decide what to do. It only took minutes to decide.
Led by a young upstart named Carahil, the Mages Guild stormed Benirus Manor and slew Lorgren. However, amid the chaos, his body vanished.
Because of this, the people of Anvil concluded the manor must be cursed. You are the first person to set foot inside in a long time.
Well, I'll be here every day from noon until midnight. Let me know if you change your mind.
Well, I'll be at The Count's Arms every day from noon until midnight. Let me know if you change your mind.
Hey! You don't even have enough money! Stop wasting my time and come back when you do.
Excellent! Here's the key to the front door and the deed of ownership. I hope you enjoy your new home.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must attend to those pressing matters I spoke of earlier. Good day.
I've heard you were able to lift the curse from Benirus Manor and destroy Lorgren Benirus once and for all.
I thank you for completing the task I set about to do long ago. His unholy craft will no longer threaten the citizens of Anvil. Well done!
Opening the door seems to have stopped the ghost attacks. Perhaps I'll leave you to the rest of this mission since my part is done.
I got the door open. The rest is up to you.
This place makes me uneasy. Let's tread wisely and make our way quickly to the basement.
I'll be glad to get this over with and get back to the Imperial City.
So you think I'm responsible? I suppose you're right, as the manor used to belong my grandfather, Lorgren Benirus.
I knew there was a curse on that place which is why I sold it to you so cheap. I suppose I should've warned you, but I had to get out of Anvil.
My family said I could move here to the Imperial City once all our loose ends were tied down. The manor was one of those loose ends.
I fear my own greed got the better of my judgment. I hope you weren't hurt badly in that horrible place.
I suppose I assumed you'd be able to lift the curse and be done with it.
Sorry. But how is this my problem?
You already bought the manor, and I have nothing more to say about it.
Yes, I'm selling my grandfather's house, Benirus Manor. If you're interested, I could let you have it for a modest sum.
I have to sell it soon, as I have pressing matters elsewhere. You're welcome to take a look at it. It is located across the street from the Chapel.
Once you buy, you get the key to the front door and the deed of ownership. That's the deal. Would you like to buy it now?
If you want to buy Benirus Manor, it's still available for a modest price. No questions asked please. Interested?
I'm overjoyed to hear that you were able to cleanse the manor. Well done my friend, well done!
A local gentleman has been looking to sell his manor. A bit run-down, but a magnificent place, and priced to move.
The manor belongs to Velwyn Benirus. He's the one to speak to.
I didn't think so. If you had some sort of evidence, like vampire dust, I might believe you. I'm not stupid, you know.
Well... maybe you're not lying after all.
If they're gone, then there's no point in hanging around here.
Damned amateurs. You people should leave it to the professionals.
Well, where is it? I sure don't see any. I'd expect you to at least have some vampire dust. Don't try to pull my leg.
And what, I'm supposed to take your word for it? Sorry friend, but I'll need some sort of proof. You got any proof?
Then why are you bothering me?
I see. Well, if you see anything around town, let me know. You could be their next victim.
Is that so? Well, perhaps we'll have to pay them a little visit. Thanks for the tip, friend.
All right, but don't tarry too long. Until we receive the Night Mother's guidance, the Dark Brotherhood will remain in disarray.
Very good! And so it begins, the Black Hand's journey into a darkness few can imagine. Let us be off! The Night Mother awaits!
All of your recommendations have been approved, have they not? Then everything appears to be in order.
Report to the Arcane University, and speak with Raminus Polus. He will provide further instructions for you.
You've been through quite a bit, haven't you? Well, I think you have proven yourself worthy. The Arcane University awaits you now.
Speak with Raminus Polus when you arrive. He will assist you.
Time for you to see where the real power of the guild lies. Raminus Polus will want to speak with you; head to the Arcane University.
I'm afraid I can't just write one out of hand. That would be against protocols, you see.
If perhaps you can clear up a small matter involving Earana, you can prove your loyalty to the guild and earn my recommendation.
Oh no, that's Adrienne's job, not mine. If you ask about it, don't be surprised if she's annoyed. She doesn't like being interrupted.
Let me know if you find anything unusual in Falcar's quarters. I'd look myself, but it's locked, and I don't have the key.
You do, however. I believe the key he used for the well should also work on his quarters.
I'll admit, it's my doing. I couldn't leave well enough alone, and after you'd left to go after that ring, well...
I'm just so tired of the way we've all been treated by Falcar! I was worried about you, and angry about Vidkun, so I confronted Falcar directly.
He was furious when I told him I'd helped you, and then when I threatened to report him to the Council of Mages, I thought he was going to kill me!
He flew into a rage! I didn't even understand some of his ranting, but he said that our days are numbered, and then he stormed out!
I don't know if he ever wrote your recommendation. I'm sorry. I didn't expect this to happen. Perhaps you should go look and see if he did write one?
You should check his room in the living quarters. If you see the note, or anything else unusual, let me know. I'll gladly send it to the Council.
Just perform the task you've been given. We'll talk more once you're done.
We can talk, so long as Falcar is out of earshot. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's trying to get you killed!
He gave poor Vidkun the same task, and we never saw him again. I'm reasonably sure there's a connection, but I can't prove it.
Do be careful. I'd hate to lose another useful Associate.
Here's the key, and something extra. I don't know if it will be of use to you, but from what I've heard of Falcar's ring, it may come in handy.
And if you find out anything about what happened to Vidkun, let me know, will you?
As I've said, I just don't feel comfortable talking to you about Falcar. Forgive me.
Don't tell me Falcar's given you the same task he gave Vidkun!
Oh, dear. I'd say more, but... well, Falcar is the ranking member here, and I don't feel comfortable talking about him. I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what. Find me when Falcar's not around, and then we'll talk. After we've spoken, you can have the key. Believe me, this is important.
I'm afraid you'll have to speak to Falcar about that.
If you want it, you'll need to persuade Varon Vamori, using whatever means necessary, to return that staff.
Are you so eager to begin? Very well. We can start, if you feel you are ready.
You've been to all the guild halls, haven't you? Well, then you're all set! Congratulations!
You'll need to speak to Raminus Polus at the Arcane University now. Look at you, moving up in the world... how wonderful!
You have all the recommendations you need, I believe. Raminus Polus will want to speak with you. You can find him at the Arcane University.
Once I can see J'skar again, I'd be more than happy to write a recommendation for you.
A recommendation, from me?
Well, of course. Raminus would naturally want my opinion, wouldn't he?
This is a situation we can both benefit from, Associate. You do me a small favor, and I'll happily send along a glowing recommendation.
If you can find J'skar, I'll write the recommendation immediately.
I've spoken with Erthor, who seems to be all right. Good work. I'll see to it that your recommendation is sent in, as soon as I have a free moment.
As I've said, I am rather busy. I'll get to it eventually though, I assure you.
Any luck finding Erthor yet? I'll need to speak with him before I can feel your recommendation has been earned.
I'm afraid I haven't given it much thought. I'm rather busy, you understand. My research occupies nearly all of my time.
Now that I think about it, I do have a small problem concerning Erthor. He's one of the guild mages here. Think you can do something about it?
Oh, yes. You still need that, don't you? Well, are you ready to take care of that matter for me now?
You'll have to speak to Dagail about that.
You have received recommendations from every guild hall, have you not? Then you are ready to advance to the Arcane University.
Raminus Polus will want to speak with you. I must say, you will be a credit to the guild. Arch-Mage Traven will be lucky to have you there.
I believe I explained your task very clearly. Find the ring, which is somewhere down in the well behind the guild hall. Bring it to me.
Do you understand, or do I need to use even smaller words?
What, you think you're ready now?
Don't waste my time if you're not ready for this. Are you prepared to do what is necessary to gain a recommendation from me?
There may be some... changes. I can't say for sure; you should talk to Deetsan.
It sure sounds like Falcar has it in for you. What a bizarre thing to ask you to do!
I think perhaps you should speak to Deetsan.
Falcar gives out the strangest assignments sometimes. It's as if he doesn't really care about them.
That would be Falcar's responsibility. Good luck.
You'll need to see Falcar about that.
This is a harsh, dangerous task for you, I realize. Your unfamiliar face makes you most useful, however.
And, what better way to learn the many uses of Restoration? Practical application is often the best educator. Even in life and death situations.
Are you prepared now? I have little time to waste.
Unlike some frivolous tasks you may be given at other guild halls, this is a serious matter, and has consequences. Are you prepared?
I have received recommendations from all the local guild halls in Cyrodiil. You have done well for yourself. You may now enter the University.
As a full-fledged member of the Mages' Guild, I now also promote you to the rank of Apprentice, and grant you the Robe of the Apprentice.
Take a moment to try it on, and then we shall speak of what comes next for you.
You haven't yet been given recommendations by all the necessary individuals, Associate. Keep working at it.
You'll need a recommendation from each ranking member at the local guild halls around Cyrodiil before we may continue, Associate.
Have you reconsidered? I'd still be willing to do that job for you, if you want. It'd only cost you 300 gold.
I tell you what. I have some outstanding debts I need to pay off. You help me out with that, and I'll help you out with getting Erthor back.
Heck, I'll even go do the job for you for 300 gold. When Erthor gets back, you can take the credit. What do you say?
So you're supposed to go out and rescue Erthor, eh?  I'd love to help out. I just don't quite feel comfortable doing that, though.
I hear Adrienne is sending you out to get Erthor. Is that right?
Hmm. It's a pity you don't have the right sort of friends. Friends that would be willing to help out with a task like that.
Adrienne Berene is the person you're looking for. I'm sure she'll be more than happy to help you.
That's Dagail's responsibility. Speak with her.
If you've got the amulet, then Dagail should be able to regain control of her visions. Then I'm sure she can send that recommendation for you.
You'll have to speak to Dagail. I just don't understand what it is she wants.
I take it you've spoken to Dagail? Then you know she is not well.
She has visions, for lack of a better term. While they used to be helpful at times, they have lately become problematic.
There was an amulet, a family heirloom, that she wore to suppress, and sometimes focus, the visions. She's lost the amulet, and so has lost control.
Ah, yes. I'm afraid I'm unable to issue a recommendation. Only Dagail can do that.
You may try to speak to her. If... if it doesn't go well, come see me.
Oh, boy. Good luck getting that.
Dagail's the only one who can write one. If she can remember who she is today, that is.
Adrienne is in charge. You'll need to speak to her about it, if you can tear her away from her latest book.
Didn't you hear? Oh, no. I suppose you wouldn't have.
You'd best go see Deetsan before you do anything else.
Falcar always has been pretty harsh, even when it comes to basic lessons. He seems to have gotten worse lately, though.
I think he even scared away the last Associate who came here for training. What was his name again?
Hmm, I can't remember. Deetsan would know, though.
You'll have to get one from Falcar, if you can.
Your time has come. The Arcane University needs you, child. Raminus Polus waits for you even now.
Great things will befall you. There will be trials, but you will prevail. You must, for the good of the guild.
You'd better speak to Deetsan about it.
Now that sounds like an odd way to prove your worth. I just don't understand Falcar sometimes.
The last Associate that came in for training never came back. I guess Falcar really upset him. Deetsan seemed mad about it, too.
That's Falcar's responsibility. He takes it very seriously.
Fair enough. He left town yesterday. I heard he was going to... uh, Anvil. Yeah, that's right. No need to go lookin' for him. He's gone.
Then I got nothing to say to you.
The poor bugger was arrested. Seems he tried to swindle the Countess. He's rotting in a cell in the castle dungeon now.
It's common knowledge that the jailors can be bribed to allow visitors to see prisoners.
I don't know where she keeps the ring, but I know who does. Talk to Hlidara Mothril, the Countess' handmaiden.
She eats dinner in the castle at the eighth bell. You may have to sweet talk her, but she knows all about Alessia Caro's habits and schedules.
You should know that there are other secrets in that castle.
Stupid guild rules! He is only an Argonian. He is less than human, and much less than Khajiit. If you must spare him, at least make him suffer.
Yes. A filthy Argonian stole my precious ring. It was a gift from my mate. It has... sentimental value. I will pay well.
The stupid lizard hunts with the name Amusei. Find him, find my ring. Make him suffer! Kill him and I will be pleased.
The guild is contracted to recover the ring. It matters not that Amusei does not have it. You must get the ring where ever it may be.
Fouled meat! You have returned Ahdarji's ring, but have also broken the covenant of the guild. Killing is not allowed.
You are no longer a member of the Thieves Guild until blood price is paid for the lives you took.
Good work. You are truly an asset to the guild. I will make sure the Gray Fox himself hears about this.
I am promoting you to Prowler. Congratulations.
Does the hunter have this one's ring?
No problem. He has an office on the first floor of the Imperial Palace. Try there.
Sounds like food on the table. Lex has a small office in the South Watchtower. Most of the tower is open to the public, but not his quarters.
He is captain of the Imperial Watch. He is pursuing a personal vendetta against the Thieves Guild and the Gray Fox.
I heard the Gray Fox personally humiliated Lex years ago when he tried to arrest Armand Christophe for theft. Lex has never forgotten it.
He's the Captain of the Guard in Anvil now. He used to be in the Imperial Watch until Countess Umbranox had him reassigned.
He made things very difficult for the Thieves Guild for a while.
I heard you were the one that made it all happen. Everyone in the Thieves Guild is grateful!
Always glad to help. Lex has an office at the top of the South Watchtower.
You lookin' for him? I might be able to help you... for a donation.
Lex has pulled city guards from several districts to the Waterfront. Last I heard he was pacing the slums there.
Sure, I know where to find Hieronymus Lex. I sure am hungry though.
A neat bit of work we did to reassign him to Anvil. One of my better forgeries.
Yeah. I've heard of him. Isn't he a soldier or guardsman in the Imperial City?
He's that Imperial Watch Captain that's always chasing after the Gray Fox and the Thieves Guild.
Chasing after shadows if you ask me. The Thieves Guild probably doesn't exist, and it's a sure bet the Gray Fox doesn't either.
He got reassigned, to Anvil I think. Without him around, all this hustle and bustle about the Gray Fox will go away.
I never believed in the Gray Fox anyway. I think the Imperium just made him up as an excuse to raise our taxes.
He's our new Captain. I've never met a finer man.
Hieronymus Lex is no longer searching on the Waterfront? This is good. It's too bad you slew innocents to make it happen.
The guild turns its back on you until the blood price is paid. Until then, leave my sight.
Hieronymus Lex has left the Waterfront? Well done! Methredhel's report tells me that you have done well. You have earned your reward.
I am promoting you to Cat Burglar, which means you can use Luciana Galena of Bravil as your fence. Congratulations on your new rank.
The Arcane University is getting restless. They have not gotten their Icestaff back.
If it is not returned soon, they will let Lex return to the Waterfront. You must finish the job. Go now!
He's a Captain of the Imperial Watch. He is pursuing a personal vendetta against the Thieves Guild and the Gray Fox.
Two years ago I made a fool out of him when he tried to arrest me. Lex has never forgotten it.
He's been ordered to evacuate the Waterfront? Excellent.
I have one last task for you. As a sign of good faith, the Thieves Guild needs to return Hrormir's Icestaff to the Arcane University.
However, the wizards are not to be trusted. I'm sure they are watching for us to put it back where you got it.
They would have no qualms about killing you once they had the Icestaff back.
Instead, I want you to put Hrormir's Icestaff into Ontus Vanin's safe chest. He keeps one in his home. Ontus is a former University researcher.
I've heard of her. What's it worth to ya?
My memory is playing tricks on me. I can't seem to remember where she lives.
Amantius Allectus? I thought you said Amantus Leckis. Sorry. Never heard of him.
You are most generous! He lives in the Temple district on the far east side. He's an early riser, usually up by sunrise.
I will sing of your charity. She runs the Fighting Chance armory on the far east side of the Market District.
Anything for you! He lives in the Temple district on the far east side.
I've heard of him. What's it worth to ya?
The holy book of the Mythic Dawn. Supposedly written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.
If it exists, it would be an artifact of great -- and evil -- power.
You should complete your initiation before we speak any further of that.
Lord Dagon wrote it with his own hand, and gave it to the Master as a sign of His favor. None but the Master may touch it or read from it.
You were fortunate to have heard the Master read from its sacred pages.
I have everything necessary for the ritual to use the Xarxes to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise.
Remember, the portal will close behind you, so you will need to take everything you need.
I've learned that the Mysterium Xarxes is both the gate and the key to Camoran's Paradise. In some sense, the book IS Camoran's Paradise.
Mankar Camoran bound himself to the Xarxes when he created his Paradise, using dark rituals which I will not speak of further.
A gate can be opened from the outside, however. It will be more difficult, as I will have to temporarily bind myself to the book.
But I believe it can be done. I will continue working to decipher the arcane items needed for the binding ritual.
This evil book was written by Mehrunes Dagon himself, and given by him to Mankar Camoran.
I believe Mankar Camoran used it to create his Paradise. It should give us the means to open a gate there ourselves. I will continue studying it.
I don't know much about it. The "Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes" are the only source we have for its existence.
The author of the "Commentaries" claims the Xarxes was written by Mehrunes Dagon himself, but no one else has ever seen it.
You must be referring to Mankar Camoran's "Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes." A common mistake.
It comes in four volumes. The first two volumes are rare, but you may run across them from time to time. The third and fourth are impossible to find.
Why... thank you! This will be enough to pay off my debtors. Please, keep the sword and armor until I can pay you back. Thank you again.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Hopefully, I'll be able to sell these for enough to pay my debt. You're a lifesaver.
But, where are they? Please, bring me the sword and armor. The debtors aren't giving me much time.
Are you certain? I can't thank you enough. Please, though. If you decide to retrieve the sword and armor, keep them. At least until I can repay you.
Not far, in my family's ancestral tomb. Here, I can mark it on your map. Please, return them to me, so I can pay off my father's debts.
A great deal, over 1,000 septims. My father was quite a gambler. Quite a bad gambler.
Gone. Dragged from our house in the night. To pay the debt, I'd like to sell the sword and armor of my grandfather, or I might be next!
You've found them? Fantastic! I can't tell you what this means to me.
They were buried with my grandfather in the family tomb. The sword and cuirass were enchanted, and should cover my debt. Please, get them for me.
I can't tell you how much your help means to me. Thank you again.
I'm afraid so. My father had a bit of an issue with gambling. I'm afraid he built up a rather large debt. Now that he's gone, the debt is mine.
Biene? She should be around here somewhere. Just look around a bit.
I am Biene Amelion.
Got a sword and armor for her, huh? Not bad work, meat. Here's your payment for the contract.
Paid her debt off yourself, did you? Not gonna get rich that way, meat. Still, the job's done. Here's your payment.
You'll find her at the Water's Edge settlement. It's marked on your map.
Is that possible? This is grave news indeed.
I had, perhaps foolishly, believed that Necromancy was all but stamped out in Cyrodiil. It seems I couldn't have been more mistaken.
I shall need to consult the Council as to how to proceed with this situation. Thank you for the information. It may save many lives.
He is an old and powerful Necromancer. Traven will recognize the name, even if you do not.
Well, when you're ready, you know where to find me.
Then let's get this over with. I don't relish the thought of spending too long inside of the manor. Follow me.
Yes, he just arrived in town recently. I believe he's staying at The King and Queen Tavern.
I believe I heard a Benirus is in town. You should check out the Elven Gardens District. A Benirus wouldn't be seen anywhere else.
As soon as you bought the place, he pretty much up and left. I hear tell he's making his way to the Imperial City.
I'm not sure where he went, but I would ask at The Count's Arms. If anyone knows where he is, it would be someone there.
That layabout? You can find him wasting time at The Count's Arms.
Okay, if you say so.
I'll be right behind you.
Oh. Well, I guess I can do that. I'll see you there, then... I hope.
Oh, thank you. You're just too kind.
Plant the bust in her cupboard. Make sure she doesn't see you. Then go tell Hieronymous Lex that she is the thief.
He probably won't believe you, so you may have to persuade him. Hopefully he will at least go and check it out.
Myvryna Arano. Now Armand needs your help to neutralize her. You are going to pin the theft of the bust on Myvryna. She lives in the Waterfront.
There never was a client that commissioned the guild to steal Llathasa's bust. Armand used you to flush out an informant that infiltrated the guild.
The best source of information are the beggars. Their eyes and ears seem to be everywhere.
However, be prepared to spend a little coin. They won't tell you anything for free. At least not anything true.
Come to pay your respects, have you? You can find her tomb in the chapel undercroft.
Her tomb is in the northern croft. It's a pity about her highness. She died so young, at least for an elf.
Rumor has it that there were strange circumstances with her death, if you know what I mean.
You can pay your respects in the northern croft. Just don't touch anything.
It's been twenty years or more since the Count married Llathasa. She was a beautiful Elven bride.
She remained young while he aged. Not too long ago she was found slain. It's all hush-hush. Nobody knows exactly what happened.
Then bugger off.
Count Indarys recently commissioned a bust of Llathasa. They say the Elves carved it. He put it near her tomb in the Chapel Undercroft.
He also posted a guard so that her tomb wouldn't be disturbed. Used to be anyone could visit her, but now it's off limits to the public.
There's a rumor going around that the undercroft may be haunted.
Hey! What are you doing?
There is nothing here. Stop wasting my time.
You were right. The bust is here and Myvryna is guilty.
Amusei tried to sell it to Alessia Caro? Argh! Stupid lizard.
Ahdarji uses ring much more wisely. I use it to collect and sell information. That ring can be used to read private messages the Count writes.
Get me that ring. Steal it from Alessia Caro if necessary. Just bring me the ring. I will pay double!
What treachery? The traitor still lives! It is Mathieu Bellamont! Do not let him harm the Night Mother! Kill him!
Enough! Enough of this! You will all suffer for the pain you have caused me! I will destroy your Night Mother, and the Dark Brotherhood will fall!
What is the meaning of this desecration? Who has disturbed my ancient slumber?
Ah, yes, I have been expecting you. The Listener now kneels by Sithis, as does his successor. There is a traitor amongst you.
Foolish little girl. Lucien Lachance served Sithis til his dying breath. The Black Hand remains tainted by betrayal. Restoration is impossible.
Dearest Night Mother! Most Unholy Maiden! Please, we beg your mercy in this, our time of need! The Black Hand seeks your guidance!
The traitor is dead, dear Mother. We have come now to ask your blessing. Anoint one of us your Listener, so we can restore the Black Hand!
Gaiar Alata is the Master's name for this place. We usually just call it Paradise.
This is the Savage Garden. At the top of that mountain lies the Terrace of Dawn, which leads up to Mankar Camoran's palace... Carac Agaialor.
Beneath the mountain lies the Forbidden Grotto, the only way out of the Savage Garden.
Wish I had more to tell you about them, but I don't.
Sure, I know about them. Look, you didn't hear it from me, but rumor is they're hiding out in Bloodmayne Cave. Four of them. Bad news.
I've got nothing to say about them.
I'm not talking about them. Not to you. I barely know you.
I can tell you about them. Murderers, all four of them. Intelligence tells us they've been holing up in Bloodmayne Cave. Watch for traps.
Wish I could help you out, but the locals aren't talking. You might try asking around, butter them up a bit. Good luck.
Apparently, there are three or four of them. Real nasty, from what I hear. You take care of them. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll surrender.
Took care of all of them, did you? And you're still alive. Fantastic. You're full of surprises. Here's your payment. Good work.
Some real hard cases got out of the Bravil prison. Been terrorizing the locals ever since. The Watch is useless, so we step in. Get to it.
I'll wait here until you're ready.
Good. I want to get this over with as soon as possible.
He might come back if he knows I'm still here. I'm not staying here!
I'll go to the Imperial City. Hannibal Traven can protect me.
I couldn't believe my eyes. I think the only reason I'm alive is because I was invisible... but even so, I think he saw me.
He killed them, one by one. Volanaro was last, I think. He was trying to run away, but he didn't make it, did he?
The King of Worms stood over him, right before he died, and he... well, it looked like he sucked out Volanaro's soul!
He said something about Echo Cave, and destroying the Mages Guild. Then he looked right at me, and grinned!
You've got to do something. You've got to tell Arch-Mage Traven!
Please, hurry. The division in the Council will be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile.
Good. Please go to Bruma; I have not heard from Jeanne Frasoric for a few days now, which is unusual for her.
While I welcome the break from correspondence with her, I worry that something may be amiss, given recent developments.
Find out if Jeanne is all right, and let me know if she needs anything.
You're a smart one then. I was going have to arrest you in a minute.
Amusei you say? I thought you wanted to see Amuday. He's off limits. Amusei though is just down the hall. Make it quick.
So Alessia Caro has recovered her ring. And now you want to know where she keeps it so you can steal it back.
My pockets are a little light at the moment... if you know what I mean.
I don't think it would be appropriate for me to talk about private family matters with a stranger.
The Countess is very happy to have her ring back. I don't think she has taken it off for days. If you want to hear the whole story, talk to Hlidara.
Countess Caro is so relieved to have the ring back. It's been missing for many years. She wears it constantly.
Well, not all the time. I mean, she puts it in her jewelry box for baths and at night. No proper lady would wear her jewelry to bed.
Lady Alessia frowns on her staff talking about her personal life. You understand, I'm sure.
Yes. After all these years, I have my ring back. I wear it all the time now.
Of course not when I sleep. I am a proper lady after all.
I don't answer questions about royal jewelry from riffraff like you.
Don't wait too long. We really need the help.
I knew the Gray Fox could count on you. The staff is in the Archmage's room. He sleeps between one and seven in the morning.
Take this note. Leave it in his nightstand. Bring me the staff when you get it.
If you mean the priest, I don't think he made it out of the city. Very few of us did.
But Savlian Matius might know more. He's in charge of the city guard that are defending the camp.
Brother Martin? Yes, he's right over there. He led a group of us here during the confusion of the attack. We owe him our lives.
I'll never forget him. He saved as many as he could that terrible night. If only they'd listened and stayed with us in the Chapel.
He is a priest in the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch. He never knew that he was Uriel Septim's son.
You need to find him at once and bring him safely back here.
He truly was the Dragonborn... the last, and perhaps the greatest of all the Septims.
You were there. You saw his true nature. The blood of the Dragon was revealed for all to see.
I knew a priest named Martin once. I'm sure he's dead, just like the rest of them. They're all dead, don't you understand?
I know he's gone. As the Chancellor of the Elder Council, my concern now is how to choose his successor.
He should be around the camp somewhere. He was with the survivors we rescued from the Chapel of Akatosh.
You mean the priest? Last I saw him, he was leading a group towards the Chapel of Akatosh.
If he's lucky, he's trapped in there with the rest of them, at least safe for the moment. If he's not...
The scholars and priests can debate what happened to Martin in the end.
What I know is that he sacrificed himself to save us all. As a Blade, I'm proud to have served such a master, if only for a short while.
So, the mages send a foul daedra to deliver a simple note when an honest footman would have done. How typical.
Don't play games with me. This isn't the time for it.
Excellent. Yours is the last item on the list. Now we just wait for the powers that be to pull the plug on Hieronymus Lex's seige.
That name sounds familiar. Something to do with the Arcane University. Most wizards live somewhere in the Imperial City.
Isn't he a wizard at the Arcane University? I think he lives somewhere in the Talos Plaza district.
Sure I know. I just need motivation.
Well, you could always just fight your way into Cracked Wood Cave and kill their shaman.
Every goblin tribe is led by a shaman, but she mostly stays hidden in the heart of the lair. Well protected.
But, kill the shaman and the tribe will dissolve into confusion. Most likely end the war.
You took care of the goblin menace? That's great news, my friend!
Now we can get back to building our new lives at Cropsford! Please, be sure to come visit us in a month or so. You have earned a hero's welcome!
Goblins have their own reasons for doing things. Don't make sense to us, usually, but I've learned a lot about their ways over the years.
Each tribe guards a head in its lair. Whose head, I don't know. A sacred tribal totem or something like that.
Anyway, if you want to rile up a goblin tribe, steal their Tribal Head. Which is often what a rival tribe does, just to prove they're tougher.
I'd lay odds that the war between the two tribes is because of a stolen Tribal Head. No other reason for a war to go on this long.
So, to stop the war, all you need to do is sneak into Timberscar Cave, find the stolen Tribal Head, and return it to the Cracked Wood Cave goblins.
Unless you want to do things the hard way...
You killed the shaman of Cracked Wood Cave!? I'm impressed! Barthel Gernand will be glad to hear that.
Amazing, you actually swiped the stolen head right out of Timberscar Cave? Ha, those goblins won't know what to think now!
You don't really need to do anything else. The Cracked Wood tribe will stop attacking Timberscar Cave once they figure out the head is gone.
Of course, now that you have the head, you could create all sorts of mischief.
You say you took the head from the Timberscar Cave goblins? Where is it, then?
I'd like to just believe you, but I can't send these people back to Cropsford unless I'm sure the goblin war is over.
Show me the head, so I know it is safe for the settlers to return to Cropsford.
Like I told you, there are only two ways to stop a goblin war.
Either kill the attacking tribe's shaman, or recover the "tribal head" from the rival tribe, which is likely the cause of the war.
Neither one sounds like a picnic to me.
Good work ending the goblin war. The settlers are very pleased. I'm pretty impressed as well.
The two nearest are Timberscar Cave and Cracked Wood Cave. Here, I've marked them on your map. Unfortunately Cropsford is right in between them.
I warned you to stay out of our way.
Prisoner, I don't have time for your games. Do that again and die.
Don't give me a reason to kill you.
I am pleased that Thoronir has decided to donate his inventory to the temple. At least he is trying to make amends.
To think, all of those items on Thoronir's shelves were only recently buried. Such blasphemy.
His inventory must be stolen. It has to be. He prices less than it costs to make some of those things. Go see for yourself.
Inventory? I am a simple trapper. My inventory just consists of pelts and skins. I would hardly call that inventory. Now get outta my way.
I have disposed of all of my ill-gotten merchandise, and replaced it with more expensive, but carefully obtained items.
I don't even want to look at it for another moment...
What about my inventory?
I'm the chairperson for the Society of Concerned Merchants. We formed this group a while back to keep a nice fair economic balance in town.
Not every store is a member, but we're slowly trying to convince them to join. Everything was fine until Thoronir opened his shop nearby.
Selling all sorts of merchandise, he undercuts prices like you wouldn't believe. He doesn't always sell what we sell, but it is still a problem.
People who buy tend to want to spend their money there. That leaves none for us. It's getting so bad, a few of us may have to close up shop.
He outright refuses to join the Society or even discuss the matter. We are convinced he is up to no good.
What we need is for you to case his establishment, and figure out where he gets his inventory. Find some proof of his wrongdoing, and let us know.
We cannot do it ourselves, as he recognizes all of us. The job pays a fair bounty in gold when he is brought to justice.
I don't know. She took the Argonian less than an hour ago though. He put up quite a struggle. He was bleeding all over the place.
Filthy vampire! She took my cellmate Theranis a few days ago. If it hadn't been for you, I would have been next.
Mina? You don't want to go asking about her. She... um... interviews prisoners. She isn't one to be crossed.
Every few days she comes for one of us. Some return, some don't. Those that are taken three times never return.
This was Theranis' third time.
Some have said they're will-o-the-wisps, though I've never heard of one killing a full-grown man.
They were seen around the Swampy Cave. Strange, moving lights. I've never seen anything like it. Old-timers have tales about such things.
I saw them a few nights ago. Very odd.
I don't know you well enough to talk about that.
They started appearing a few nights ago. Odd, flickering lights. In the morning, there was nothing to see. But they were there at night.
Horrible, just horrible. Those poor people.
You should ask Drarana Thelis about that.
Oh, no! You believe trolls killed them? That's horrible. Good that you've killed all of the trolls, though. Please, take this, with our gratitude.
Oh, no! You believe trolls killed them? That's horrible. Please, if you can kill all of those trolls, we'd greatly appreciate it.
Will O' the Wisps? I've never heard of them killing a man! Please, find out what happened to our friends. We're counting on your help.
Some folks reported seeing strange lights near the old Swampy Cave. We sent folks to investigate them, but haven't seen them since. We need help.
Trolls, huh? And drawn in by will-o-the-wisps? There's some lousy luck for you. Well, here's your payment.
Afraid to say, I don't have any more contracts for you. I don't think Azzan has any, either. You did pretty good work, meat.
Afraid to say, I don't have any more contracts for you. Maybe Azzan has some, but I don't know. You did pretty good work, meat.
Some folks are missing in Harlun's Watch. We've been contracted to find out what's happened. Speak to Drarana Thelis for all the details. Get going.
Please, rescue my daughter from those brutes! I fear for her safe return!
I fear that whilst out rock-picking, she was apprehensive. Stolen away! My suspension is that ogres have abjected her!
Please search to the east of my sprawling abode. They have been known to vacate these premises. I am most gracious and truly woeful.
You got her back in one piece? Good work! I've always liked that girl. May have to look her up sometime. Here's your payment.
A fine model of an Orcish woman. Now go find her. And don't be rude, or she'll rip your ears off.
He's an Orcish noble. A fine man. Our families go back a bit. Anyway, his daughter is missing.
Head to his estate and talk to him. Find his daughter. And mind your manners! I don't want you embarassing me!
I am Lord Rugdumph gro-Shurgak. How may I persist you?
Better that you should be adequately prepared. I shall await your return.
Very good. Let me explain what is at stake.
The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time.
It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild.
Most of our information on the Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.
He doesn't leave Castle Skingrad often. At ten he heads over to the West Weald Inn. Then at noon he goes to the Colovian Trader.
You mean other than at the Castle? Hmmm. He's around town at midday. Try the Colovian Trader and the West Weald Inn.
All right men. We've been ordered back to our posts. I smell the dirty hand of the Gray Fox behind this.
The prey escapes. Return when you have the book or know that Theranis will return with it.
Theranis is dead? I grieve for him. But at least you have the book. The Gray Fox has sought this book for many years.
All would be good if you had not killed to get it. The Thieves Guild has no use for you until you pay the blood price.
I do not wish to set eyes on you until you can cleanse the guild's honor by paying blood price. Go now.
You have earned the reward. Here is your payment.
He told me to give this message to any member of the Thieves Guild that asked about him or a book.
Look under the bush near the well, behind Nerastarel's house. I was going to take it for myself, but I owe you a great debt. You should take it.
If that's Theranis' treasure, I know where it is. But I'm not telling you anything until we're out of here. Get me out of the castle.
As soon as we are out of sight of the castle's main gate, I'll tell you.
We have a... situation. The Count has sent most of the servants home. You have to leave. Sorry, but you ain't working here anymore either.
I'm not surprised. Nobody wants that job. Let me know if you change your mind. It will probably still be available.
You will?! I mean, good! Mind your manners in the castle. Stay out of Count Hassildor's quarters. And don't let me catch you in the wine cellar!
The jail guards in the dungeon will unlock the cell block door if you ask them. Feed the prisoners once a day. I don't care when.
They sometimes need folks to work in the castle. Most are afraid to go up there though. Try asking the butler, Shum gro-Yarug.
I heard that Shum gro-Yarug is looking to hire. He's the butler for the Count. Go speak to him.
I need someone to slop food to the prisoners. I'll pay you 2 gold a week, plus half a loaf of bread and a glass of mead each day.
I'm having trouble hiring these days, so if you want the job it's yours.
Hmm. Yes, it can be done. I can change it to give Lex the highest recommendation. I'll need a full day to properly forge this letter. Return then.
And of course I will expect payment in full at that time.
I am disappointed. When you are better prepared, return to me.
That is good. Remember, this is a mission of stealth, not blood. Your payment will be higher than normal to cover the expense of the forgery.
Don't take too long.
We shall be stealthy.
You and four other operatives will stage high profile thefts, all at the same time. Hopefully that will force Lex to reassign the Watchmen.
Your target is the Arcane University. We've had our eye on Hrormir's Staff for some time, but have been waiting for the wizards to be distracted.
This is the perfect time. Will you help us?
Hieronymus Lex has vowed not to leave until the Gray Fox is in custody. The Fox is safe, but the Thieves Guild cannot do business like this.
The poor of the Waterfront are kindred to the Gray Fox, and will not betray him. However, cubs soon get hungry. Soon someone will break.
Many guild members could be jailed. Find Methredhel in the Imperial City. She is co-ordinating the guild's response.
We are thieves, not murderers. That is the province of the Dark Brotherhood.
For reasons unknown to this one, the Gray Fox has extended his protection to the Umbranox family and Lady Umbranox in particular.
While Lex is a problem for the guild, his unwavering loyalty and resolve make him the perfect protector for Lady Umbranox.
These are foul times for us. Armand is under house arrest, again. Our business in the Waterfront is totally shut down.
We need to get Hieronymus Lex to lift his siege. I have put together a plan.
The Thieves Guild refused to take me, so I came here. Leyawiin is my home. It is where I was raised.
I went to the Imperial City in hopes of joining the Thieves Guild. Now I am forced to live as a freelance thief.
Caranya turned on the Guild?
I... I don't understand. She was one of my most trusted advisors.
The situation grows more dire with each passing day, it seems. I fear where this will end.
The amulet is safe, however, and that must be enough for now. Thank you for returning it.
Caranya insisted on removing it from the University. She said it posed a threat to the safety of the Imperial City.
While I do not doubt that she was right, I question whether her motives were genuine. She seemed all too eager to explore its power.
I fear she is not safe from the minions of the King of Worms. She is at Fort Ontus; please, go there and return with the Amulet.
Help her to see that she should not use the weapons of the enemy, especially out of fear.
What? You're here to take it back to Traven?
Oh, my dear. I'm afraid you're in over your head.
I don't answer to Traven. I heed only the word of Mannimarco.
When he has the amulet, his power will be increased, and Traven will be helpless to stand in his way. You, I'm afraid, won't be standing at all.
I promise I'll make this quick. I'd like to have you mostly intact, so Mannimarco can suck the marrow from your bones.
Irlav is dead?
I tried to warn him. I tried to tell him it was a mistake to leave with the Helm.
I shall return the Helm to a secure place in the tower. It's the least I can do for Irlav. Thank you.
It was last seen in the possession of Irlav Jarol. He was taking it to Fort Teleman; I can only assume he is still there.
Please, return the helm here before any harm comes to it, or those who are using it.
A group of mages led by Irlav Jarol took the Helm, and have retreated to Fort Teleman, in an effort to study it further.
They hope to learn enough from it to find some way to fight Mannimarco. I tried to dissuade them, but it was no use.
I would like the Helm returned, so that it may be kept safe here in the University. I fear Irlav has made himself a target for the Necromancers.
She was a ruthless woman, and I'm glad she's gone. Such a waste...
She was a ruthless woman, and I'm glad she's behind bars where she belongs.
I'll turn over her body and the bodies of her compatriots when we arrive at the Imperial City. Don't let it trouble you, friend.
Selene no longer holds the Bloated Float. Once we get to the Imperial City, I intend to make sure she is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
It's a pity she wouldn't surrender. Such a waste of a young life.
I feel much better now knowing she's locked up.
Please. Get her below like I asked so we can get underway.
Now that she's surrendered, please escort her to the last room on the inn deck. We'll lock her in there until we arrive at port.
I thought I heard an Imperial woman's voice while I was blindfolded. Other than that, I don't know much more about her.
Too bad she's dead. She wasn't a bad looking woman... for an Imperial that is.
I saw them haul her off to jail. She was not happy! Ha ha ha...
I'm glad that you were on board to help rid me of them. If you hadn't been here... I don't even want to think about it...
Well, I'm afraid all of this was my fault. They hijacked the Bloated Float because of me. Business has been waning of late, so I invented a story.
I fashioned a tale about a "Golden Galleon" that the previous owner hid within this very vessel. It was to be a statuette made completely of gold.
At the time, the idea was quite clever, I thought. I figured the lore would draw more curiosity seekers and adventurers looking for the treasure.
What could the harm be if while they were here, they bought a drink or two? My business has increased quite a bit since I leaked the story.
Well, obviously, I was mistaken. It was a terrible idea. I'm just glad that no innocents were hurt; I wouldn't want to have their blood on my hands.
Anyway, sorry to ramble. You better get below now and rest until we arrive safely at the Imperial City docks.
If you get Selene safely locked up, I can tell you all I know. I won't feel safe until you do that.
Nice work getting rid of them. If you ever need a job as a bouncer, I am sure I could put in a good word at some of the tougher taverns in town.
All I know is there seems to be four of them. They blindfolded me before they put me in here, so I didn't see much.
We aren't here for that! My patience is at an end, as will soon be your life!
H-how did you know about that? No matter. Once I've taken care of you, we'll scuttle the ship and be off to our safe house.
No one will find us there.
There's no cook on board the Bloated Float! How dare you try and make a fool of me! After I deal with you, I'll feed your body to the slaughterfish!
Hahaha! We made a solemn pact not to let anyone else join the gang. I can remember it clearly even though it was...
Ha! Those will be the last words that leave your lips!
Wrath? I told him to guard the wheel and not talk to anybody. Who are you?
They oughta just give you guys a key. But no. I have to keep locking and unlocking the door for the slop drudges. Follow me.
Naw. But it will earn ya two years in Skingrad's dungeon. Now get lost before I decide ta report ya.
You will have to track down one on your own. I don't know of any in Bravil.
With the forged letter in hand, sneak into the Legion Commander's office in the Imperial City Prison and seal it with his seal.
Dairihill cannot be trusted. You must deliver the letter to Lady Umbranox in person. Will you accept this commission?
Do you have my fee?
Why are you bothering me? It isn't done yet. Now get out of here and let me finish.
My memory fails me.
Why, yes it would! Theranis was drinking in the Two Sisters Lodge. He was bragging about stealing something from the castle.
Unfortunately, Captain Dion was also in the Two Sisters Lodge. He arrested Theranis and hauled him off to the dungeons.
Theranis? How did you know about him? He was my cellmate. At least until the Pale Lady took him away.
Here's what I know. Theranis was drinking in the Two Sisters Lodge. He was bragging about stealing something from the castle.
He is a skillful thief. I seem to remember something about him. Something recent. Something important. Something is missing in my hand...
You mean the thief? He was in the big cell with that Argonian. They were always whispering to each other. The Pale Lady took him days ago.
I ain't tellin' the likes of you!
He's the crowning achievement of Relmyna Verenim. She's my teacher. The Gatekeeper keeps out people who don't belong.
I saw some strangers heading up there earlier. If they're still alive, you can see the Gatekeeper in action. It's glorious.
He's Relmyna's crowning achievement. The Gatekeeper keeps out people who don't belong in the Shivering Isles.
She made him in the Gardens of Flesh and Bone. She's my teacher. She's going to teach me all her secrets.
Oh, and this is really interesting -- wait! Never mind. My big mouth almost just got me in trouble again.
I'd like to tell you, but... really, I shouldn't say anything more.
I've been dying to tell someone. You seem trustworthy enough... but don't tell Relmyna I said anything!
Her Gatekeeper is flawed! Her tears hurt him!
The Gatekeeper's dead. Relmyna is very unhappy about that.
I'll have to tread lightly around that subject, or I might get another lesson in the exalted nature of Pain.
He's pretty scary, isn't he? Let's watch him in action.
Pretty scary, isn't he? Jayred's planning on killing him. I don't know how... the Gatekeeper looks indestructible to me.
You want to know about my child? Go see for yourself. He guards the Gates at the top of the hill. Be warned, he doesn't play nice.
The Gatekeeper is my child, the consummation of Sheogorath's wisdom in the womb of my genius. It was a painful and bloody birth, but well worth it.
His brothers were less... successful.
He won't bother those blessed by Lord Sheogorath. You, however, will die trying to get the keys from my child.
He's dead? I bet he died of some horrible disease, didn't he?
Go up there now. The Gatekeeper is about to turn some adventurers into bones. I'll collect those later.
I want him dead. I need him dead! His bones are calling to me. Rumor has it you want him dead, too.
If you're any good with a lockpick, we can help each other out. We can get into the Gardens of Flesh and Bone.
He must die. It's the only way.
The Gatekeeper's dead. He won't stop us from coming and going now.
The Gatekeeper's dead. As soon as you get one of those doors unlocked, we can go in. They're calling to me from in there.
He guards the Gates of Madness. See for yourself. He's about to destroy a party of adventurers.
He guards the Gates of Madness. Don't get too close to him. He'll kill you, and it will leave a mess in my town.
Jayred Ice-Veins wants to kill the Gatekeeper. Sounds like suicide to me.
I'm glad you took my advice and killed him. I always knew it could be done. What would people do without me?
He protects the Gates of Madness. He'll kill anyone who gets near. He's about to destroy some adventurers up there now.
He protects the Gates of Madness. He'll kill anyone who gets near... anyone except Relmyna Verenim. She's staying upstairs right now.
He's dead? Hmm. Of course, I'm too tired to walk all the way up there at the moment. I'll head up there after I rest my eyes for a moment.
Let's go!
Hurry. The bones are calling out to me!
The arrows are ready. Here are some for you, and I'll keep some.
Let's go kill the Gatekeeper. We might die. But there's worse things.
The arrows aren't ready yet. Come back later.
Here we are!
Hurry up! The bones are calling.
Hurry!
Here. Take this lockpick. Careful, it's the only one I've got. You open the door. I'll kill things. Let's go!
My scouts reported no signs of the Mazken in the Underdeep. It's our best chance to take them unawares.
Too risky. It's likely to be a trap. They could cut us to pieces down there if they knew we were coming.
With all due respect, Aurmazl, I ask that you reconsider. The main passage is strongly defended. Perhaps if you'd allow me to scout further...
Enough! I've made my decision. We will attack down the main passage, as planned. The Mazken will not withstand us!
That's why females command and males take orders. Come. Let us surrender to the madness of battle!
You'll make a fine commander one day. Come. Let us surrender to the madness of battle!
You've seen this with your own eyes? I must be sure it isn't a trap if I'm to take such a risk.
You're making a mistake. There is no other way to light the Flame.
If you think the Mazken will help you, you will be disappointed. We will destroy them with or without your help.
Go then. I will hold off on my attack to give you a chance to reconsider. But I will not wait forever.
That's an excellent idea. They cannot refuse entry to an emissary of Lord Sheogorath.
Return at once when you have their deployments. This could make all the difference.
Are all males so obstinate? Have I not already told you that I consider that route too risky?
What makes you think you can persuade me when my own lieutenant cannot?
I've already made my decision. We attack down the main passage!
Very good, Emissary. With your help, we will rid Cylarne of the Mazken once and for all!
Ah, Mirel's beloved surprise attack. A perfect example of why males do not hold command positions.
He has failed to consider the risks of his plan. If the Mazken have prepared an ambush along that route, we would be slaughtered.
We're better off storming the main passage, where our superior strength and bladework can come into play.
The only way to assault the Altar of Despair is down the main passage between the two altars.
It will be difficult. The Mazken have fortified their position. But I am confident that with your help, we can defeat them.
Will you help us retake the Altar of Despair, and drive the Mazken out of Cylarne once and for all?
Are you ready to help us destroy the Mazken and take control of the Altar of Despair?
The two Altars, blessed Despair and holy Rapture, feed the great Flame of Agnon above us.
Only Sheogorath's immortal servants can kindle the Altars, and I am at my Lord's command. But I only hold Despair... for the moment.
The Aureals hold Rapture, and are massing to attack us. But never fear, they are no match for us.
Once their main force is destroyed, with your help, we can easily take Rapture from the few survivors. Then, I will gladly kindle the Flame for you.
Only the immortal servants of Sheogorath can kindle the Altars of Despair and Rapture, which in turn feed the holy Flame of Agnon.
Once the Aureals are routed from the Altar of Rapture, I will be most pleased to command my soldiers to light the Flame for Sheogorath's glory.
The holy Flame can only be lit from the Altars of Despair and Rapture. Alas, the Aureals hold Rapture... for now.
You should speak to the Grakedrig Ulfri at once. She will be glad of your help to rid Cylarne of the arrogant Aureals once and for all.
Only the servants of Sheogorath can light the Flame, by kindling the Altars of Despair and Rapture which feed the Flame.
Alas, we hold only the Altar of Rapture. The treacherous Mazken hold the Altar of Despair. We must control both to light the Flame.
If you help us seize the Altar of Despair from the Mazken, I will be honored to kindle the Flame of Agnon for my Lord Sheogorath.
The Flame is fed from the Altar of Rapture and the Altar of Despair. Only servants of Sheogorath can kindle the Altars.
Once we capture the Altar of Despair from the Mazken, it will be my great honor to light the Flame for Lord Sheogorath.
The Flame is only lit at the command of Sheogorath, from the Altars of Rapture and Despair within the Shrine itself.
I'm sure the Aurmazl Kaneh will be glad to help you once the Mazken are driven from the Altar of Despair.
Our rivals. The so-called Golden Saints. One day, Sheogorath will finally recognize their bull-headed stupidity and expel them from the Realm.
That's what we call ourselves. The most loyal and honorable servants of Sheogorath.
You know us as Dark Seducers. A name given us by our enemies. But we are the Mazken in our own tongue, Sheogorath's only truly loyal servants.
The treacherous ones: the Dark Seducers of ill-repute, whose every action drags Sheogorath's holy name through the mud.
I knew it! You should tell Kaneh what you saw. Maybe you can convince her to change her attack plan.
She thinks the Underdeep is a trap. It's true, if the Mazken knew we were coming that way, we wouldn't stand a chance.
But I'm convinced the Mazken don't expect us to come that way.
If we attacked in full force, we could take the Altar of Despair before they had a chance to react.
If only I could make Kaneh see that.
My scouts recently discovered another way through the ruins to the Altar of Despair.
The Aurmazl Kaneh wants to assault the altar down the main passage, but the Mazken are expecting us to come that way.
They've strongly fortified the main passage against us. If we attacked through the Underdeep, we could take them by surprise.
If only Kaneh would listen to me. An attack down the main passage will end the same as it always does -- a glorious defeat.
The sacred stones! You've desecrated them with your touch. You're on the list for sure now.
I would never have allowed myself to do that. However, now that they are befouled, I can use them. You may grovel in gratitude at my feet later.
Yes! Yes! I can use this to charge my magicka. All I need is a source...someone nearby...someone with magicka. Someone on the list!
...Someone like you! No need to thank me for letting you give me your power. I deserve it, after all.
Problem? I supose you think that everyone with stunted magicka has a "problem." You're nothing but a bigot. You're on the list now.
Hloval's treachery is second only to my cowardice. My curse will not allow me to help you with his need.
Hloval healed my betrothed once. Then he ran out of magic. He said he needed to find someone to lend him some before he could help her more.
Hloval dances a little too close to Sheogorath, if you know what I mean. Those born with stunted magicka shouldn't become priests and healers.
0, 5. Hloval is our priest and healer. 7, 7.  Unfortunately he was born with stunted magicka, but not a stunted ego.
2,1. He does the best he can, but he never seems to have enough magicka. 5, 6.
It was an honor for me to help Prior Dreth. The pain of the stab wound was a small sacrifice to restore his magicka.
You mean that stupid doll? I think he's been blessed a little too well by Lord Sheogorath. He's on the list. Not first though. Definitely not first.
Desideratus is a gentle fool. I never should have allowed him to take up the sword. My curse will not allow me to help you with his need.
You burned her?! She's gone?
You have driven all meaning from my life. I shall throw myself upon the swords of the Fanatics so that I may join her sooner.
She's in the hands of the Fanatics! I must save her. Stand back, stranger. I need room to swing my sword.
My Beloved! I'll carry her away to safety. Should the fanatics get her, I...I...I would have to kill them all.
She is the love of my life. I would do anything to save her.
Desideratus is a little too attached to that doll, if you know what I mean. They don't like to dance. It gives me the creeps.
0, 9. Ah, the doll. Poor Desideratus. 1, 5. Fanatics killed his whole family. 9, 6.  That doll is all he has left of them. 5, 5, 9, 4.
You must help us break the cycle of torment. Help my people overcome their weakness and defend Vitharn from the Fanatics.
Walk among them. There were four who failed to protect the gate lever. Find out what they did wrong and help them correct it.
You can put away your sword in these halls. Unlike the defending spirits, within these walls, none will war with you. Not even the Fanatics.
Arrogant fool! I curse you to remain trapped here with the shades of my people.
As we are doomed to eternally relive the last moments of our failed attempts to save our keep, so shall you eternally watch us.
Wisely answered. My people and I are in need. Maybe you can help us.
Centuries ago, Vitharn was overrun by Fanatics. We were soft and failed to defend ourselves. I was the weakest of all.
Now, the shades of my people are cursed by Sheogorath to repeat the final moments of their failures, over and over again.
As you wish. But I advise you to join the winning side if you really want the Flame relit. The Aureals will never drive us from Cylarne.
I never suspected that Kaneh had the audacity to try such a risky assault.
But we'll teach her to try to take the Mazken by surprise! We'll cut them to pieces in those corridors! I'll redeploy my forces at once.
You return to Kaneh and lead her into the trap. Once they are destroyed, I will kindle the Altars. Good hunting, friend.
This will be a glorious day! Cylarne will finally be free of the Aureals. Follow me. We're expecting the attack at any moment.
I have ordered my troops to deploy into the Underdeep. Your job is to lead the Aureals into our trap. Don't worry, we'll be ready for them.
We are expecting the Aureals to attack any moment. They'll come down the main passage from the Altar of Rapture. They always do.
They are overconfident, as usual. We have prepared many traps and ambushes. It will be a glorious slaughter.
Once the Aureals are destroyed, I will light the Flame of Agnon for you. Will you help us defend the Altar of Despair?
Are you ready to help us defend the Altar of Despair from the Aureals' attack?
Then you have arrived just in time to help us defend the Altar of Despair.
Once the strength of the Aureals is shattered, I will be honored to light the Flame as my Lord Sheogorath commands.
We are preparing to wipe out the arrogant Aureals once and for all.
Once they break themselves on our defenses, Cylarne will be ours, a gift for our Lord Sheogorath.
The Flame is lit from the Shrine's two Altars. Once the Aureals are driven out of Cylarne, it will be our pleasure to light the Flame for Sheogorath.
The Grakedrig Ulfri will explain everything. You should speak to her at once.
Alas, we cannot light the Flame until we take control of the Altar of Despair from the infernal Mazken.
The Aurmazl Kaneh would wish to speak to you at once. Proceed through this door to our main encampment at the Altar of Rapture.
My pardon, Emissary. I am at your service.
We are preparing to sweep the Mazken scum from Cylarne. Perhaps Sheogorath sent you to help us?
The Chalice is in Dunroot Burrow. Haven't you been listening?
I don't ask too many questions of Thadon. It's precious to him, and that's all that matters. It's his own business.
But, didn't he mention where it is?
Oh... I see. How brilliant of him. This is for you as much as it is for him. Oh, very good Thadon!
Dunroot Burrow is your goal, my friend. And what a goal it is.
You don't understand. This isn't just about the Chalice. This is about you. We must discuss Dunroot Burrow.
The Chalice has altered the effects that Felldew has on you. You'll find that it now provides minor benefits, without any of the withdrawal.
Do you really require help in finding it at this point? I suspect you can manage on your own from here.
Thadon's problem. Not mine.
The Chalice is one of the Duke's prized possessions. He has been at a loss without it.
Not my place to talk about it. You need to know, you talk to Wide-Eye.
I've told you what I will. The Chalice is a corruption. Felldew is a poison, not an amusement. You're better off leaving the Chalice where it is.
You think I care for Thadon's toys? It matters not to me whether he suffers in agony, or erases his mind with drugs.
But if you insist... Do you know the lengths of his depravity? How low he stoops to pursue his pathetic lifestyle?
Felldew is a poison. It kills. And yet Thadon uses the Chalice he created to twist Felldew into a drug he takes for his own amusement. How sick.
If he were smart, he'd thank Sheogorath it's out of his hands now. And, of course, he'd never risk himself traveling through Dunroot Burrow to get it
You want information from me? After what you put me through?
Why would you come to me with Thadon's problems? You think I don't know what you've been tasked with? Why would I help my enemy?
You have the stink of Mania about you. Leave before I start vomiting.
I feel as though we've talked about this. Am I mistaken?
Perhaps you're mistaken, and we have spoken of it. I simply can't recall. I could think so much more clearly if I had the Chalice.
Oh, so you've heard of it?
Wonderful to have it back. Really, truly. I can't thank you enough. Oh, wait. I already did.
Is Thadon not waiting for you to return the Chalice? Go to him, then! Do not anger him, for then you risk angering me as well.
If you are working to help Thadon, I'll tell you whatever I can.
Oh, you're helping him? Why didn't you say so?
I'd do anything for him. Anything at all. Eat my own young if he asked me to...
And then he... He goes and does... If I find out who she is, I'll tear her limb from limb!
But... You don't need to hear that. You need to know. You need to know what he's asked of you. The Chalice, yes?
I heard that you were coming, looking for Thadon. Yes, yes. Heard it all. Bored to tears by it.
He's waiting for you. Unless he isn't. He wasn't, but then he was. Maybe he still is.
Thadon has told you what he wants. Consider speaking with the others in his court, particularly his steward.
He is aware you are here, and should be waiting for you. See him at once.
Our own Duke, aligned with the forces of Order? An infuriating thought!
He will suffer greatly at the hands of Lord Sheogorath.
The long-reigning Duke of Mania. A Master of Merriment, if you will. Or if you won't; I suspect it wouldn't matter to him.
What reason could she have to turn on Lord Sheogorath Himself? She must know that He will find and punish her.
We will catch her, and will turn her over ourselves. Her treachery cannot be allowed to stand.
Our own Duchess, aligned with the forces of Order? An infuriating thought!
She will suffer greatly at the hands of Lord Sheogorath.
The Duchess of Dementia. Ever wary, ever worried. A prisoner in her own House, in a way. And a delightful conversationalist, really.
A bit harder to meet than Thadon. Consider making an appointment.
Go there. Take the Felldew from the Elytra, eat it, and your journey begins. You will be thankful to Thadon when this has passed.
Yes, yes. A most unique place. Of course, the Chalice would be there! Don't you see? It's the Elytra. They're the reason.
The Chalice, Felldew, Elytra... it's all connected. One without the others is no good, poison. Oh, a rough road awaits you.
Some Elytra there are... different. You'll need to get Felldew from them, and eat it. Can't get in without it. But once you do...
He wants you to learn for yourself. Learn, grow, experience. It's his way. I shouldn't say more. But the Burrow, it's northeast of New Sheoth.
I believe you've already been instructed as to how to proceed. You'll need to ingest Felldew to enter the Burrow.
You've already been warned that this will weaken you, so do take the necessary precautions.
Don't I? I thought I did. But then I also thought that you would be heavier. Look at you, you're light as a chair. How DO you walk around like that?
It's all the same to me, either way. All of it. Nothing is right without the Chalice. Have you ever used it? No, of course not. You simply must!
You just have to try it. It'll change your world, expand your horizons. Contracting leads to expanding, you know. Well, most of the time.
Yes, yes... That just might be true. Or I've not been waiting at all. Forever and nothing are almost the same thing, wouldn't you say?
How do you tell one from another if you're smack in the middle? Don't answer that, I already know the answer of course. It came to me during a meal.
Not a very good meal, though. Too much pie. Pie is a tricky thing, wouldn't you say? Don't answer that either.
Now that forever is over and you're here, you need to go away. Yes, away. There are places you should be, far away from here.
The Chalice of Reversal is waiting for you. When I say you, I mean me, but it's no difference to the Chalice. One ends up being the other.
Haven't I? Hmm, perhaps not. It felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them.
A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much.
Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing.
You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything.
I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?
Oh, I wouldn't say that. How long is an eon, when you're ten thousand feet tall? Or if you're purple? It's all relative, you see.
You wouldn't really know how long it's been, since you weren't here. If you'd been here, it would've been no time at all, so who's to say?
Don't answer that. I know the answer. I knew far more answers once, but they seem to have dried up. Or perhaps they drowned. I don't know anymore.
You see? You see what I have to deal with? I can't recall if I'm coming or you're going without the Chalice of Reversal. Oh, now you've upset me.
We hold on to fleeting things even as we slip. I knew, and yet I indulged myself anyway. I indulged her a fair bit, too. Hee hee!
It was passion, it was... forbidden. Oh, the things that would be said if word got out. That made it all the more delicious.
From Dementia's own court, no less. Scandalous! Fatal, perhaps. But passion makes no accomodation for self-preservation.
You haven't heard of it, yet you know its name? What a strange creature you are.
One of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Those Elytra, clever little bugs that they are.
Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the Chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest.
But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Damn her!
Then you know why I want it back! Can you imagine trying to eat Felldew without it? Disastrous! Curse that woman!
It's that fool Bat gro-Orkul. He thinks his armory is more important than the town or our lives. He's first on the list. Oh, yes! First.
Athel was a brave scout. She brought us the first word of the Fanatics. My curse will not allow me to help you with her need.
Bat loves his arrows. They aren't Althel's, they're his. Bat would be betrothed to his arrows if he could. By the way, have you seen my betrothed?
Bat gro-Orkul is so stingy with the armory. He should dance today. He may cost us our town today. Then we'll see who dances!
So what you're saying is you really, really need these arrows? Go ahead. Take them. What would I want them for?
I can't give you any arrows because then the armory would be empty. Then what would I do if someone needed some arrows?
I wouldn't have any, that's what. So these arrows are staying right here in case someone needs them.
2, 7, 1. You have arrows! 8, 2, 8.  Now let the battle be joined! 1, 8, 2. Why aren't you counting? 8, 4, 5.
1, 2, 3. That idiot Bat gro-Orkul refused to equip some of us. 5, 8, 13.  He has arrows, but won't give me any of them. 21, 34, 55.
Oh, it wouldn't do to speak of it. Thadon's plan for you, I mean. I like you, little one, but I would never interfere with what Thadon wants.
Well, perhaps Thadon would want you to have a bit more guidance. He did say that you should talk to me, did he not?
Felldew is a poison, little one. A very dangerous drug. You'll feel good at first, but that wears off, and if you go long without it, you'll suffer.
Do keep in mind that some Elytra will not consider you a threat while you are feeling the effects of Felldew Euphoria.
You need to strike a balance with how often you ingest Felldew, and how willing you are to live with the side-effects.
I've told you, it'll kill you. Actually, now that I think about it, why don't you go eat some? Eat all you can find. I'd get a chuckle out of that.
I've told you, it'll kill you. While I don't care if it does, I don't think you want that.
It's a poison, plain and simple. It'll make you wish you were dead. And given enough time, you will be.
The Elytra in Dunroot Burrow, the ones that secrete it are immune, but they're the only ones.
If the Felldew didn't kill you, the Elytra would. You're better off just leaving the thing in the ruins above the Burrow.
Hmmm. Not surprising. Well, if you change your mind, and the position is still available, come speak with me again.
I'd so enjoy that....
Fine. I'm sure my Lord will be most pleased, assuming you ever manage to see Him.
You'll want to pass through the Gates of Madness. Oh, and mind the Gatekeeper. He dislikes strangers to the Realm.
Enjoy your stay.
Who is to say? There are always choices to be made. The Realm of Madness is no different in that regard. Your choices are your own.
Enter or do not, but make your decision. I've other duties to which I must attend.
Speak with me again when you have made up your mind. The anticipation is almost too much to bear.
You do as you will. You may leave the way you entered. Your life will be none the worse for your time spent here.
Or, you may continue onward, through the door behind me. If you can pass the Gates of Madness, perhaps the Lord Sheogorath will find a use for you.
Cured? You speak as if they are diseased. They live now in another state of being. Perhaps it is you who needs a cure.
They entered this Realm, and were ill prepared. Their minds are now the property of my Lord.
For you? I do not know. My Lord seeks a mortal to act as His Champion. As for His intent... to attempt to fathom it is a foolish endeavor.
His will is His own; His reality follows suit. You are here because you chose to enter; you were not summoned.
Because my Lord wills it to be so. It poses no danger to Mundus; no compact has been violated.
It is a doorway, an invitation. Perhaps you will accept it for what it is.
You approach the Shivering Isles. Through the door behind me lies the realm of Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never-There.
I am Haskill, Chamberlain to the Lord Sheogorath.
Ha! It's your funeral. I'm just here to warn people, not keep them out. Go ahead in. I'll be here to clean up the mess when you come out.
Look for yourself! Their brains are addled. Got no sense! Perfectly normal people went in there. And this is what's come out.
Yes. You have entered and now you are here. Amazing. Truly.
I don't know where it came from, and I don't want to. Those who've gone in have come back out... wrong. I'm just here to warn folks to stay away.
Fearing one day someone might manage to kill my child, I have been preparing a new body.
I've created versions of each appendage, with various enhancements. You must choose one of each. I am attached to them all. Artist's prerogative.
Select one pair of legs, one left arm, right arm, torso, head, and heart. See me when you have finished your selections.
Are you not the exalted Duchess? Slayer of the great Gatekeeper? Champion of our mighty Lord Sheogorath?
I'm sure you'll be able to find these things, if not, perhaps Sheogorath's faith in you is misplaced. Go now. You try my patience.
Are you not the exalted Duke? Slayer of the great Gatekeeper? Champion of our mighty Lord Sheogorath?
You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone and collect for me these things:
Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and the Essence of Breath.
Bring me Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and the Essence of Breath.
For many years, I labored painstakingly in those Gardens, until my back bent and my soul became crooked.
But the fruits born of that labor were the essential components of true Flesh.
You will go there and gather the components needed to bring my new child into this world.
Yes, powerful magic indeed. It is proper that you bid me kindly, lest I show you the meaning of pain and suffering.
Alas, I am still distraught over the destruction of my sweet child. I cannot return to his womb. You must do this.
You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone. There you will gather mystical components needed for the ceremony.
Go fetch me Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and Essence of Breath.
And take this key. It will allow entry into the Gardens and give you direct access to my Sanctum.
Fine. If it be my Lord's will, then it is also my own. But, I am too distraught over the death of my child to return to his womb. This, you must do.
You will travel to the Gardens of Flesh and Bone. There, you will gather mystical components needed for the ceremony.
And take this key. It will allow you into the Gardens and give you direct access to my Sanctum.
Ah, your tone is more in line with my station. Please, continue.
Oh? Does he now?
Ah. That confirms it. You're the new Duke. The stink of hubris surrounds you! My Lord allows you to lick his boot straps, does he?
Well, then. I trust my servants didn't give you too hard a time getting here. Haha! Perhaps the Duke would like to explain his business?
I see. Sheogorath is too important to come on his own account? He sends his mortal lackey?
Well, then. I trust my servants didn't give you too hard a time getting in here. Haha! What is it Sheogorath's lackey requires of me?
Now you make excuses? Pathetic. On what authority have you weaseled into my sanctum and disturbed my work, hmm?
Am I, really? I think not. Be that as it may, on what authority do you disturb my work?
The ends justify the means, do they? You'll pay for that, one day. Now, by all means, come right in, walk in here as if you own the place....
By what authority do you disturb me?!
I can tell you that while she stays out of the public eye these days, she does still hold audience in her court during the day.
You may attempt to approach her then. The Lady has been concerned about her safety lately, so be prepared for a hostile reaction.
You wish to see Lady Syl, do you?
The Lady has refused any and all appointments of late. You'd have to try and find her on your own, and I don't recommend that course of action.
The defenders of the gate were not the only ones to fail their town. My greatest shame is that I was struck by cowardice and fled.
Like my people, I am doomed to repeat the actions of my cowardice. Alone, I cannot redress this wrong. However, you can.
Take my helm. With it, you can take my place in the defense of the gate. Defeat the Devoted Fanatic in combat, and the curse will be lifted.
Be warned though. While you wear the helm, it is as if you are one of us. You are trapped in these ruins until you lift our curse.
No? Have you seen my torture chamber?  Because that's where you'll wind up if you don't agree to assist me. Think on it.
You're going to find out who knows. You're going to learn who keeps secrets, who conspires against me.
You will be my Grand Inquisitor. Expose the conspirators, and they will be punished, I assure you. Find out who keeps secrets, and what they are.
Speak with Herdir. He will help you. Do you understand what is required of you? If no one is found, you will be held responsible.
What more is there to say, Inquisitor? Lady Syl has her moment of glory. Allow her to bask in it.
Lady Syl will be quite pleased to hear that her concerns have been proven valid. You shouldn't keep her waiting.
Nelrene admits to being involved, but more evidence may be required.
Ma'zaddha may have returned with more information by now.
The Inquisitor now has significant evidence pointing towards Muurine. Perhaps a talk with her is in order.
It would seem that your only course of action now is to extract information from Nelrene, Inquisitor.
Convincing a Dark Seducer to reveal secrets to you may require more pressure than you've experienced thus far.
Congratulations. You've gained another ally in your efforts. Do remember to follow up with Ma'zaddha.
In the meantime, the other party in that conversation may be of use to you as well.
Surely the Inquisitor has considered that with direct evidence, Ma'zaddha may now be more responsive to questioning.
The Inquisitor is now required to be secretive? Consider that Herdir's presence may be a detriment to you.
He is not known for his ability to remain hidden.
It would seem that direct torture may not always yield the results you seek. You may need to try a different approach, Inquisitor.
Paranoia is the order of the day in Crucible. Many keep their eyes open constantly, and some of those eyes may have seen something useful.
Ma'zaddha is particularly reclusive, and may not respond well to questioning. Again, you may find Herdir's assistance necessary.
Torture may be a necessary evil to accomplish Syl's goals. Make sure Herdir accompanies you to talk to Anya.
Keep in mind that Anya is cowardly, and may require persuasion to tell you what she knows.
You may find the enormity of your task daunting at first. Use Herdir's talents to aid you with those who are unresponsive to questioning.
You have been asked to work with Herdir, I understand.
Herdir has a great affinity for his work, and can be a very useful ally to you. Do not hesitate to make use of his talents.
You've got what you need from me. I can't tell you anything more.
I've told you all I know. It was Ma'zaddha... I don't know anything more, I swear it!
What? N...No. I don't know anything about anything. I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Yes? What would you have me say about it?
I don't know anything about a conspiracy!
You already know my part in this. There is nothing more to say.
You have no proof! You cannot hold me accountable for anything!
I hope for your sake you are not accusing me of anything.
Haven't you got what you need? Shouldn't you be running off to tattle like a good little servant?
I see you've done quite a bit of work to track me down.
Yes, I orchestrated it. Syl deserves to die a painful death for turning on all of us, and consorting with our enemies.
Go ahead, do what you will. Nothing matters now.
Leave me be! I've told you what I know!
Nothin' in it for me, so I've nothin' to say to you.
I don't expect we'll learn much. While I have the utmost respect for her Ladyship, she is well known for being... overly cautious.
We must carry out her wishes, however. And I, for one, am looking forward to, ahh... interacting with the citizens of Crucible.
No, no. I know nothing.
I've agreed to help you already. Torturing me further will do you no good!
I've told you, I don't know anything. You can't prove a thing!
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
I've told you what I know. There's nothing more!
I've nothing to tell the likes of you!
I've told you everything I know! I swear!
I don't know anything about a conspiracy, but Anya has been looking extra nervous lately.
She might know something more than I do.
No conspiracies here. Go pester someone else.
I don't know anything about a conspiracy.
You're the only one who understands me, and you'd think me a traitor? You disappoint me, friend. I'll take my leave now.
Naryan that! I'll balitoe before I krayble.
You know what I know. There is no more.
I don't spread gossip. I have nothing to say.
Find those who plot against me. Bring them to me so I might make an example of them.
Oh, no. You'll not drag me into Syl's mess. She made this bed, now it's up to her to burn it.
Arden-Sul was perhaps the greatest Duke to walk our land.
Many years ago he decided to hold a night of absolute indulgence, resplendent with dance, wine, and sex to celebrate his fondness for his brethren.
The Greenmote flowed like water in a stream as the revelers voraciously succumbed to its rapturous ways.
Certainly. When the ruler of Mania has decided it is time, he will choose a successor from his court.
The successor is invited to a huge celebration... a night of hedonistic revelry; wine, song, and, of course, Greenmote.
During this, the exiting regent imbibes three doses of the potent drug. This causes his heart to burst... and his lifeblood flows from his body.
The successor then gathers the drug-tainted blood and brings it to the Altar of Arden-Sul in the Sacellum.
Once this is done, I will proclaim the successor a Duke or Duchess. Then, Sheogorath gives His blessing, and the cycle is completed.
Obviously, no matter which path you take, it ends in the death of either Syl or Thadon.
Just remember not to deviate from the Ritual's guidelines. One would hope you can do that.
Didn't we go over this already? Bring the Duke's heart to the Altar of Arden-Sul. It's quite simple.
Seldom is the subject ever bro-... wait a moment, did you want to hear the history of the Ritual?
As I've told you friend, the Duke's drug-tainted blood must be brought to the Altar of Arden-Sul.
An important part of our history, my friend! I would be glad to tell the tale if you have a moment.
Very well. Spoken like a true son of the Demented.
To become ruler of Dementia, the current leader's heart must be cut out and brought to the Altar of Arden-Sul in the Sacellum.
Once this is done, I can pronounce the heart-bearer a Duke or Duchess. Then, all that is required is the blessing of our lord, Sheogorath.
I offer you this: remember who it is you're attempting to replace. You'll need to approach them in a manner to which they are not accustomed.
Syl anticipates plots against her, so expect heavy resistance that may require a great deal of fighting and physical exertion.
If you wish to replace Thadon, try a less direct approach that will involve cunning and subterfuge. He isn't likely to see you coming.
Interesting. Not many wish to hear about such things, but I would be glad to oblige.
Becoming the Duke of Dementia requires passage through the Ritual of Accession, specific guidelines set forth by Arden-Sul himself.
Yes... how we would all aspire to be as great a leader as the First... our savior Arden-Sul, the greatest Duke of the ages.
We celebrate him with the Ritual of Accession... the path to Maniac Bliss.
As it happened so many years ago, my lord Arden-Sul suspected a traitor in his midst.
Not wishing to find himself on the wrong end of a blade, he gathered his flock here in the Sacellum.
By poisoning the sacramental wine, Arden-Sul was able to suppress any such conspiracy in one fell swoop.
No. No, no, no. Absolutely not.
Well... yes. Absolutely. Bit of a shame for them.
But, sometimes you need to break a few eggs. Or skulls. There are rules, though. Even in the Isles. Rituals and rules. You need to follow them.
Speak to Arctus and Dervenin, the High Priests at the Sacellum Arden-Sul. They can explain what needs to be done.
And you've always got our man Haskill to call on for help. Faithful like a good hound, that one. And he looks better in a suit.
How does one describe utter euphoria?
It is the substance that shapes our imagination and makes every day a joyful, waking dream.
Harvested from the spore trees that dot Bliss, the Greenmote is refined and kept in storage for use by all.
A dangerous choice. I like it! She's gotten to be a bit much, anyway. Thinks everyone is out to get her. Which they are, in this case. So be it.
A safer choice, perhaps. Maybe you'll live through this. Thadon's a bit lost these days. Not that it's a bad thing. It suits him. Until now.
Besides, won't it be a grand surprise when you make his heart burst from too much Greenmote? Thadon loves surprises!
That's exactly what they'd be expecting. They'll have replacements lined up, and then there could be even more of them surrounding me.
No, no. Too easy a fate for them. That's why you're going to help me. You're going to find them, force their hands. Put them to the screws.
Could be all of them. Every last one. None can be trusted.
But they'll never take me down. Never! I'll see them all rotting in shallow graves before I let my guard down!
You... you will help me. Yes, yes. You will be most useful.
Hrmph. Very well, Steward. I believe you. You may return to your duties. And of course, thank you for your time.
What do you mean, she goes somewhere? Where does she go?
Very well, then. You leave me no choice...
Yes, yes. I'm sure I will. But for now, we still have the matter of the information you're withholding. Will you share it with us?
Does that pain you, Kithlan? Unless you want to feel it again, you'd best tell us what you know.
I'm sorry, Kithlan, but I don't believe you. I think you're lying. And you know what happens to people who lie to me.
Is that so? Well, then perhaps you know something that may be useful to our Inquisitor. Would you care to share that information?
Lady Syl, you mean. And you know I have her full authority to do what is necessary. Your innocence must be proven.
Hello, Steward. Welcome to my little corner of the castle.
She doesn't tell me where she goes. It's not my place to know. Please, there's nothing else. There's nothing else to tell you.
Wait! Wait, no. Please. All I know is that on certain nights, Syl asked me to guard her chambers. She never said why. I think she went somewhere.
I told you. I'm not hiding anything.
You'll.... You'll pay for this, Herdir. Make no mistake...
What are you talking about? I don't know anything! There's nothing going on!
But I AM innocent. I've done nothing!
Herdir, you filth. You don't dare touch me. Syl will have your head!
Shhh. The walls have ears!
I hear that in light of recent events at the palace, Anya Herrick is more loyal to Syl than ever. In fact, she rarely leaves her side!
Do you take me for a fool? How do I know you aren't acting as an agent of Dementia?
Well, I've heard that recent events in Syl's court have made Kithlan a bit disillusioned with its leadership. But you didn't hear that from me.
Yeah, sure. Like I'm going to say something about Syl's court to the likes of you!
Yes, I must attend to him. Speaking to you has already cost me time. I must go.
Such a kind and noble man. In times like these, it's good to have a leader who still enjoys all the modern pleasures Mania has to offer.
If I were you, I'd check with Thadon's Steward, Wide-Eye.
You can usually find her roaming around New Sheoth, or spending a lot of time on the palace grounds.
Ah yes, and what of our Duke of Mania?
Thadon may be in a constant state of euphoria, but I wouldn't underestimate his intelligence. Oh, this is so much fun!
All I can tell you is Syl is rarely seen in public, and her staff takes care of the day-to-day activities.
I'd check with Anya Herrick, her Courtier, and Kithlan, her Steward. Maybe they can help you.
She is staying well out of sight. No need to take unnecessary risks.
I maintain a close watch on her. She fears that Sheogorath no longer favors her presence and wants her replaced.
I suppose I should be grateful working in the palace with her, but I can't stand having to constantly look over my shoulder.
I don't know if she has it in for me or not. I think she is in constant fear of being replaced.
Syl is as crafty as she is beautiful. I'd watch my back if I were you. Oh, this is so much fun!
Yes. He then removed their hearts from their bodies and used his ancient scrying technique known as visceromancy to read their lifeblood.
When Arden-Sul couldn't divine the traitor's true nature in their hearts, he became distraught and took his own life in the same way.
From that day on, the Ritual of Accession for the throne of Dementia was set.
Ahhh, but it was. As the bacchanal reached a crescendo, the people began to clutch their chests as their very hearts exploded!
The Greenmote had taken its toll. The ground stained a deep crimson as the sanguine liquid flowed from their lifeless bodies.
To represent that night, when the ruler of Mania is to be replaced, he partakes of the Greenmote and allows his lifeblood to flow upon the Altar.
Yes, yes! I swear it's the truth! Please, please let me go!
It was Muurine. She said she found a note from Thadon, that she would tell people it was written to me unless I paid her. It's not mine, I tell you!
I... I didn't do anything. She threatened me, but I didn't do anything. I'm loyal to Syl, I tell you!
I... I don't want to stay here! Please stop hurting me!
What? No! I'm loyal to Lady Syl, I swear it! I would never turn against her! I just heard a rumor, that's all! I don't know anything!
No, no! I haven't been plotting anything! I swear it!
What? I... No, that's not it at all. I just... I don't know. Why am I here?
As you wish, Miss Herrick. Thank you for your time. And please, come back and see me some time.
Threatened? Who threatened you, my dear?
Yes, well. I suspect our Inquisitor would like to see you leave as well. As soon as you tell me what I want to know, you may go.
Now Miss Herrick, can we be frank with one another? I find you delightful. I'd so enjoy the pleasure of your company for a long time to come.
I think there's more to it than that. And I see that I'm going to have to persuade you to be honest with me. How delightful.
Come now. We all know you've spread rumors about Thadon leaving his section of the palace late at night. You've been meeting him, haven't you?
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that. You're here because you know something. You're plotting behind Lady Syl's back, and you've been caught.
Welcome, Miss Herrick! Welcome! I'd been hoping to have a chance to chat with you. I get the sense that you avoid me.
Now you will release me at once!
Why would I be so stupid as to carry it around? It's safe in my home. Yes, that's right. Are you going to go and get it yourself? I think not.
The note from Thadon, talking about some secret rendezvous with someone from Syl's court. I'm sure it's important to someone.
Ha ha! Weren't expecting this, were you? You'll get no more enjoyment from me today, Herdir. All I know about is the note.
The pleasure you get from this hasn't escaped me, Herdir. So this time, I'm going to deny you that pleasure. I'll tell you what you want to know.
I see you've made it even more painful. You do enjoy your work, don't you Herdir?
Hurt me all you want, Herdir. You know I won't talk.
Where is this note? Produce it immediately!
I... What note are you talking about? I don't understand.
What? Is this some kind of a trick?
I get by. But let's not change the subject. We're here to talk about you. About what you know.
Shall we try again?
Oh, my. Well, if you insist.
Welcome back, Muurine. It's been an unusually long while since I've seen you here.
You know truth when you hear it, Herdir. I have spoken truth. You cannot intimidate me, so I suggest you release me at once.
I cannot say, as I do not know. Only Kithlan has access to certain areas of the palace aside from Lady Syl. Perhaps it was him.
I am being honest, that is all. The only strange reports I have received are of a robed figure seen leaving the palace late at night.
I have no reports of any such conspiracy at the present time, despite my Lady's repeated insistence that one exists. There is no danger.
Perhaps not, but we both know it's something you've fantasized over. I'm surprised you can contain your excitement to speak. Get on with it.
Spare me your pleasantries, Herdir. Ask what you will and be done.
I had hoped we'd spend more time together, but yes, I realize you're being honest. Thank you for your time, Nelrene.
Is there anything else you'd care to reveal, as long as you're here?
Really? And whom might this figure be?
Is that so? But isn't that exactly the sort of thing you'd say if you were behind it all? You're in a position to deny it.
Oh, Nelrene. You take the fun out of everything. Very well. What do you know of a conspiracy against Lady Syl?
Come now, must we start with hostilities? This situation is not of my creation.
I must say, this is quite a surprise! I certainly didn't expect to see you down here, Nelrene.
Well, the best I can offer is help with the guards. I can distract at least two of them and get them to leave her wing of the palace.
That should help you to get in there a bit easier.
Hmmm. That may be difficult. Syl has been hidden from public sight lately. However, I can give you something that may help.
Take this key. It should unlock any door in her wing of the palace. You still need to be wary of her Seducer guards, but it should help.
Perhaps I've misjudged you. Alright. I'll help. Just remember me when you take over her position.
What can I do to help you?
Ha! You're mad! Syl has yet to be bested in any combat!
Unless... well, if you think you have a chance. How do I know this isn't some sort of trick?
Yes, I see you may have what it takes to replace her.
Very well, what is it you need from me?
No! I cannot even think such thoughts. How do I know I can trust you won't become just as tyrannical as she has?
I had hoped you would have it with you. Go get the stone and return at once.
Capital! Now I can see past the palace defenses. It's a good thing the Emperor didn't know they had this stone.
He would have had it destroyed or taken it from them and kept it under lock and key in the palace.
Now for the bad news. You committed murder to retrieve the stone. I am forced to remove you from the Thieves Guild until you pay the blood price.
You may pay me now, or Armand Christophe later should you choose to return to my good graces.
When I have learned what I need to know, I will call for you again. Let us leave Helvius' house now. He has served me well and deserves his peace.
My sources tell me that Savilla's Stone has gone missing. Do you have it with you?
I have no idea what you are talking about.
I've never heard of it. Why do you ask?
I really shouldn't be telling you this, but I know you are trustworthy.
The blind monks in the catacombs guard the stone. It's said to have magical powers.
Don't tell Hridi I said anything. I could be banished for telling you.
Who is this Savilla? A former lover perhaps? I don't know anyone by that name.
The Gray Fox has a task for you. Meet him at Helvius Cecia's house in Bruma.
Capital! The monastery is called the Temple of the Ancestor Moths. It is where retired, blind Moth priests go to wait out the rest of their days.
I will mark the location on your map. Look for it in the far northeast of Cyrodiil, beyond Cheydinhal.
I need you to acquire Savilla's Stone. It is a large crystal with special properties that I need to gain... advantage.
Remember, do not shed innocent blood. However, there is no bloodprice for slaying the stone's guardians, human or inhuman.
When I receive word that Savilla's Stone is missing, I will be here waiting for you.
Preparation is the key to success. Come back to me when you are better prepared.
You bastard! It's not like I killed her. I just roughed her up a bit. Nothin' the healers can't fix.
Just unlock the door. A couple of hours after you're gone, it will be quiet again and I can sneak out.
You should know better than to give heed to rumors.
I see. I suppose there is no hiding it from you. No hiding. What a joke! My whole life is hiding.
Everything in that document is true. My identity cannot be known. In fact I just told you my true name twice, but I bet you don't remember it.
You and I have even met before, when I was not wearing the cowl. To your clouded memory he and I are two different people.
My own family doesn't even know me. I would give much to be rid of the Gray Cowl and its curse.
You think this is Nocturnal's cowl? Where did you hear about that?
Well go get it!
Hmmm. I had hoped for the whole arrow, but that is not your fault. I will have to have it repaired.
This arrowhead advances my plan... nevermind.
Where was I? Oh, yes. You have embarrassed the Thieves Guild and me with your crude murders to recover the arrowhead.
Until you pay the blood price, your membership in the guild is forfeit. You can pay me now, or Armand later if you wish to rejoin.
This arrowhead advances my plan to... nevermind. I may have need of you again in the near future, if my plans hold.
Here is your reward. I am also promoting you to Master Thief in the Thieves Guild. Fathis Ules of the Imperial City will be your new fence.
The Gray Fox has a task for you. Meet him at Malintus Ancus' house in Chorrol.
Do you have the Arrow of Extrication?
Then make your preparations. I will expect you to return soon.
Capital! Bring me the Arrow of Extrication. It has a key shaped head. Bravil's court wizard, Fathis Aren, recently acquired this unique item.
You may kill Fathis if necessary, but not in the castle. My spy network will tell me when you have it. Return here with the arrow when you do.
Now we should get out of Malintus' house before we wear out our welcome.
Capital! The Earl of Imbel is the only descendant of his line that I have been able to locate.
His name is Jakben, and he lives somewhere in the Imperial City. There might be a clue in the Earl's house.
This task can wait, at least for a little while. Return when you are ready.
The Gray Fox requests a meeting. Please travel to Ganredhel's house in Cheydinhal.
Do you have the boots?
Close up left! Protect the Emperor!
Looks clear. Come on. We're almost through to the sewers.
Hold up. I don't like this. Let me take a look.
Here they come again!
The captain's down!
You! Prisoner! Stand aside. Over by the window. Stay out of the way, and you won't get hurt.
Prisoner! Stand away from the door! Over by the window, now!
Prisoner! Get over by the window, now!
Stay put, prisoner.
Captain Renault?
You ... I've seen you ...
No... Talos save us...
Get back with the Emperor! Protect him with your life!
If you want to help, get back and protect the Emperor!
Looks like this is your lucky day. Just stay out of our way.
You stay here, prisoner. Don't try to follow us.
Leave the Emperor in peace.
First, place the Gatekeeper's body into the Cistern of Substantiation.
At the beginning of the worlds were five. Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Light. Darkness turned into day, the void took form.
Hidden away, by virtue of its own self-awareness, was the sixth, containing within it the five which birthed it. Flesh!
Meat with the desire to consume like Fire....
Place the Dermis Membrane into the cistern.
Blood, liquid nutrient, that ocean which casts pearls of life upon the shores of existence....
Place the Blood Liqueur into the Cistern of Substantiation.
Bone, branch and stone of the body, giving shape and structure....
Place the Osseous Marrow into the cistern.
Breath, child of air, bestowing movement, the stirring of spirit....
Place the Essence of Breath into the Cistern of Substantiation.
And last, the light of Flesh, the illumination of Soul -- perception, thought, memory, imagination....
I summon thee, walker in Flesh! Flesh of true Flesh! From those waters of Oblivion which sire thy kind.
Come to this altar. Join with this body. Quintessence of Flesh joined with the Essence of Flesh. Absolute in mortal. Immortal bound to contingent.
Stand clear of the cistern. Over here by me.
Honored Daedra, fear not thy abasement! Thou shalt be the Holy in this Temple.
I bind thee Atronach to this body, henceforth Gatekeeper of the Shivering Isles.
My child. It is time to fulfill your destiny. Stand guard in this land against all those who seek entry not bearing the mark of Sheogorath's favor.
You shall know them by the coldness in their minds. A darkness of spirit.
What's this? My child, they are coming. Destroy them! Show them your true power!
Watch my child destroy the interlopers, or run to Sheogorath. Either way, tell Him of our doings here. Send Him my tribute... and my affections.
Very well. But do be quick about it!
It's essential. Simply essential! If only it were essentially simple... but it's not.
I want him there guarding those Gates. If any of Jyggalag's forces show up, he should be ready for them.
It wouldn't do to just let them in if more show up. And more always show up. Still and all, I think things are going well, considering!
Go talk to Relmyna in Xaselm. Tell her you're working for me. She'd do anything for me, that little minx.
A powerful Sorceress. Maybe a genius. And a complete lunatic. All in all, my kind of person.
I brought her to my Realm so she could continue to study her "sixth element." Honestly, I didn't know there were five already.
She's a bit obsessed with it. And with Me. Makes dealing with her difficult. You shouldn't have any problems, though. No one likes you that much.
There are those who prescribe a mystical quality to the Grove of Reflection in Milchar. If you ask me, the matter is purely practical.
There is a great deal of runoff from the waters of Mania that collects in Milchar. One particular tree has grown healthy from those waters.
The Grove and the Tree retain a number of psychotropic properties that supposedly bring one to personal revelation.
The truth of this, well, it is open to interpretation. Being the pragmatic fellow that I am, I side on the practical explanation.
One thing that is not in dispute is that the Tree has survived for eons and its branches are highly valued as components of magical artifacts.
The roots of the Tree of Shades run into the heart of the Shivering Isles.
It is said that the tree feeds from waters of the Grove of Reflection. The grove can show men who they truly are.
Now that you have faced the truth, the Tree has given its branches to you.
Combined with the Eye of Ciirta, the shell of the Staff can be remade.
Only after facing the truth will the Tree of Shades give up its branches to you.
While not the source of the Daedric Princes' authority, each Daedric artifact provides that Prince with a measure of power.
Lord Sheogorath chose you to sit on His throne. With the Staff, you may be able to do just that.
You possess the eye and the branch. Together, they shall form the physical shape of the Staff of Sheogorath.
After I shape them into the Staff, you must take it to the seat of power in the Shivering Isles -- the Palace of Sheogorath.
There, imbue the Staff with power from the Font of Madness. Soak the staff in the waters of the land, and it will open its full power to you.
You have defied the expected and accomplished something that denies all logic. I must contemplate the error in my calculations.
Now... take your treasure and leave me.
I can create the physical shell of the Staff, but the divine essence must be gathered elsewhere.
The Staff of Sheogorath contains a portion of the divine power of the Daedric Prince. It is the embodiment of Sheogorath and of this land.
Should you succeed, you will be the first mortal to have a dedicated Daedric artifact in your possession. This will be most interesting, indeed...
But, apotheosis is no simple matter and the creation of the staff is no simple task. I will require two sacred items in order to complete it.
You now hold the physical component of the Staff of Sheogorath. Before it is complete however, it must be imbued with power.
It will draw its power from the waters of the Font of Madness in the Palace.
All shall crumble before Jyggalag!
Sheogorath is dead!!
The realm is dead!
I had intended to give you My staff, the symbol of My office. But life has gone from it, as it goes from Me. It is now dead wood. A useless twig.
With the staff, there was hope. But now, hope is dead. I am dead. The Realm....
Optimism! How adorable! I love it! Even at the end, you make me laugh. I'm lying. That wasn't funny at all.
No matter. Soon you and everyone else will be dead, and I will be left a mad god, ruler of a dead realm. Again.
What happens is what always has happened -- what always will happen. I crumble, I fade, the Realm dies. And you with it.
Flee while you can, mortal. When we next meet I will not know you, and I will slay you like the others.
Knifepoint Hollow is near the core of the Shivering Isles.
Follow the setting sun to the border of Mania. Climb the cliff there to the top. At the peak, you will find Knifepoint Hollow.
Knifepoint Hollow is my prison. As the Great Library, it once contained all the knowledge in creation.
However, spare me your grief. My imprisonment is as meaningless as my immortality.
Time and place are nothing. Constructs of a feeble mortal mind attempting to categorize and understand the world around it.
If you were one of the fortunate few, you would one day understand and accept this. However, you are not and you will not.
Knifepoint Hollow is my prison. Hewn from the stone by Sheogorath for the sole purpose of containing my knowledge.
That which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff.
The ruins of Knifepoint Hollow once served as a great library. There, you will find a door. Behind that door, you will find the answer you seek.
Although... I hesitate to guide you towards this path. The secrets of the past will surely aid Jyggalag, but I fear that we have no other choice.
Be mindful of what you find there. The library is a thing of Order, and it will still serve that end.
Take this crystal. It contains the power to open the sealed door. Inside, you will find the final remnants of the library.
Unfortunately, when Sheogorath faded, the power of the Staff faded with him. It must now be remade.
The Staff is the symbol of power in this Realm. He who rightfully holds the Staff may hold the throne of the Shivering Isles.
However, the secrets of its construction are lost.
True, but perhaps you can hold the throne -- provided that you possess the proper symbol of office. Namely: the Staff of Sheogorath.
Why, you will, of course. It has always been Sheogorath's intent for you to be the new Madgod.
You will sit on the throne. It has always been Sheogorath's intent for you to be the new Madgod.
My duty now is to the Realm. By serving you, I serve Lord Sheogorath.
The only way to protect the Realm from the Greymarch is to place you in the Throne of Madness.
The Staff of Sheogorath holds the secrets of this Realm.
As such, it requires a vessel that has witnessed dark secrets. Ciirta has seen things with her eyes that no mortal has.
Because of this, her eye will serve well to contain that which the staff must hold.
Now that you have both components, I can remake the shell of the staff.
Now that you have her eye, you must seek out a branch of the Tree of Shades.
The trees and branches of this Realm feed from a deep font of madness and mystery.
One of the oldest trees, named the Tree of Shades, lies in the halls of Milchar. Milchar is a place of ruin, root, and mania.
Go there and bring me a branch of this tree, but be warned -- the tree will not surrender its secrets to one who has not earned them.
The Shivering Isles hold many secrets but few remain unseen by mortal eyes.
The Staff is a tool of great vision and thus, requires the eye of one who has witnessed one of these unseen secrets firsthand.
Ciirta resides in the Howling Halls of Mania. Find her and bring me the eye that has seen that which no other has.
Here in this Realm where secrets are power, Dyus is a being of great might. He has knowledge of events beyond even that of the Daedric Princes.
Fortunately, Dyus has such an intimate knowledge of things to come that he sees no purpose in taking any action, since the outcome is written.
Of course, that point is infinitely debatable by those of us who prefer to believe in the value of personal choice.
He is kept locked away to prevent curious beings from using his knowledge to subvert the personal choices of other creatures.
Given our unusual circumstances, I have asked you to seek out his aid. He is all that remains of Jyggalag's great library.
You were expecting a book. An ancient tome filled with the secrets that you seek. But instead, you have found me. The last remnant.
Individuality is an illusion. The details of my existence are no more important than the history of a stone.
However, if you insist: I once served as the keeper of the great library of Jyggalag.
Individuality is an illusion. However, if you insist: I once served as the keeper of the great library of Jyggalag.
Then perhaps my sword can find the words that your mouth cannot!
City Watch? I doubt it. But since you have aligned yourself with them, I think it's time to put an end to this conversation.
There's no one else in our group except the four of us. The Blackwater Brigands don't just take on new members out of the clear blue sky.
When we formed the Brigands three months ago, I was told no more than a four way split on all the profits!
So stop telling lies and tell me what you're doing here!
Intruders are my business. I think instead of locking you in the storage room with the bouncer, I'm going to dump your body overboard!
What? I was told there are only two others on board. I locked the bouncer in the Storage Room and she has the owner. So that leaves you.
Now, I'll ask again. Who are you?
No. But he did give me a message about a treasure to deliver to the Thieves Guild if I was ever to get out.
After the first time Theranis was taken by the Pale Lady, he knew he was going to die.
Get me out of the castle and I'll give you his message.
Then just tell me when you've decided.
I'll wait here then. Let me know when you've made up your mind.
Okay, I'll just wait here until you tell me what to do.
Okay, but remember. I'm not so good at close combat - you'll have to watch out for me.
You've got it. I'll do my best to keep everyone healed.
Okay, I'll go over there now.
Let me know when everyone is ready.
Right. I'm on my way.
Okay, but that puts me farther away from the group.
Okay, I'll head over there now.
Okay, I'll head over there now. Let me know when everyone else is ready.
Do you want me to stay back, or stay up nearer to the door?
Where should I wait? Up close, or farther back? I'll try to help whomever I'm near.
There are two good locations to hide; one near here, and one closer to the door. Where do you want me to wait?
I can manage with a weapon or with spells, but I've really been working on healing lately. I'm getting pretty good at it.
Well, I excelled in my studies in magic, especially large-scale spells. I'm pretty accurate with them, too. More accurate than swinging a sword.
I have to admit, I'm better with an axe than I am with Magic. I've been working on spellcasting, but I still feel better with a weapon in hand.
Dedicated to the last! I cannot thank you enough for bringing the gem here. I have need of it immediately.
We have much to speak of, and very little time. A new task awaits you, and it is by far the most important you have been entrusted with.
You must make sure the gem does not reach Mannimarco. We are doomed if it does.
I have an idea of what this gem is for, and I want you to make sure it never reaches Mannimarco's hands.
There is a group of battlemages tracking the Necromancers carrying the gem. I want you to meet them near the ruins of Silorn.
They can aid you in defeating those that carry the gem. Once you have it, bring it here to me.
Exercise caution when approaching the ruins; the Necromancers control that area and you may inadvertently expose your allies' position.
Impossible! You defeated the three of them alone? I - I'm humbled by your skill, and fear that assaulting you would lead to my own quick demise.
Please accept my surrender. Here's my blade. Please. No treasure is worth my life. The Bloated Float is yours.
Wrong, fetcher! I'm tired of this conversation! Time to end it with steel!
A-again you have surprised me with your knowledge of our operation. I suspect Lynch didn't check all the inn rooms before we departed.
You must have been hiding down there and made your way up here. How did you get past Minx, Wrath and Lynch?
Well, since they're out of the way, if I kill you, that means Selene and I split the take two ways. This heist is getting better and better!
Liar! We never met yesterday! You're an intruder!
Damn that woman! She promised a four part split when we recover the Golden Galleon. She never said anything about splitting it five ways!
She said when we got back to the safe house in Bravil, we would divide the loot after she fenced the damn thing.
Do Lynch and Minx know about this?
Over my dead body!
Orders? Selene didn't tell me about this, and I don't remember her taking on someone else to help us find the Golden Galleon.
When did all this happen?
You? You bested Lynch? I always knew he was out of practice. Oh well, I suppose it's up to me to do his job for him as usual!
You are a liar! Lynch had specific instructions not to disturb me. Since you came from below decks, you must have gotten past Lynch.
I swear, you will not get past me!
What does she need assistance with? She has Ormil under her own watchful eye in his cabin. Something isn't right here. What happened to Lynch?
The only way you're getting off this boat is when we throw your corpse over the side! Hahahaha!
Lynch sent you up here? Why? Did he send you to talk to Selene?
Lead on, my friend.
To Weynon Priory, then.
The sooner we reach Cloud Ruler Temple the better. Lead on.
I'm right behind you.
We'll follow your lead.
Lead on. I hope we're almost there.
We'll hold them off as long as we can. Return quickly.
I'll stay here until you're ready to continue to the Elder Council Chambers. Don't be long.
I've put myself in your hands. Don't fail me.
I'll keep an eye out for trouble while you're gone.
I was looking forward to reaching Cloud Ruler Temple. Don't be long.
Well... alright. I think we'd be better off sticking together, though.
We'll hold this position as long as we can.
As you wish. I'll stay here until you get back.
Ah. It seems you have stumbled over a bit of history that few in the Thieves Guild ever discover. I am not the first Gray Fox.
That master thief died sometime shortly after stealing the Gray Cowl and receiving Nocturnal's curse.
However, another thief in the guild picked up the cowl and assumed his identity and the curse. No-one in the guild knew it was a different person.
Over the centuries there have been dozens of Gray Foxes. To the rest of the world he seems immortal and unchanging. I am hoping to be the last.
Did I know him personally? Of course not. He lived 300 years ago.
Don't waste my time. Not in the mood for it.
Capital! This may be the last piece of the puzzle. I need to spend more time with Savilla's Stone first.
If all goes well, I may call upon you for one last task. The danger will be great, but the reward will be greater. Unfortunately, there is a problem.
I am deeply disappointed that a Master Thief had to resort to murder. I hearby revoke your Thieves Guild membership until the blood price is paid.
I am truly indebted to you. If all goes well, I may call upon you for one last task. The danger will be great, but the reward will be greater.
For now, here is your reward. Let us leave Ganredhel's house and go our separate ways. We have overstayed our welcome.
The family crypts are under the house. They give me the creeps. I have the key. Take it. Just don't hurt me!
Take everything, just spare me!
I don't know this Springheel you are asking about. However, the entrance to the family crypt is in the cellar. Take what you want, just spare me!
Only the Earl has a key. I have been warned never to enter it, on pain of death.
That would be me. I am so glad you are here to save me from the vampire!
Those cretin Skingrad guards caught me stealing a fish and locked me up.
You have saved my life, again. You are a true friend. I will not forget this. I've decided to join the Thieves Guild. No more jails for me!
Capital! I like the swiftness of your reply. Here is your reward for getting me those boots. Be ready. I may call for you again.
Capital! I knew you could not stand for a stain on your honor, or that of the guild.
Capital! I hearby reinstate you into the Thieves Guild.
This is good. Your honor is restored. Your overdue promotion may now be granted. I am promoting you to Prowler in the Thieves Guild.
Your honor is restored. The Thieves Guild welcomes you back. This one may now pay you for finding the book.
You have restored the honor of the Thieves Guild. This one welcomes you back into the guild. I am promoting you to Cat Burglar.
Welcome back into the guild. For getting Lex reassinged, you are being promoted to Shadowfoot. Congratulations.
Your generosity restores your honor within the guild. You may now seek membership.
As a new member, you now owe your loyalty to our guildmaster, the Gray Fox. He has three rules you must follow.
You have restored your honor and that of the Thieves Guild. I can now officially pay you for your efforts and promote you to the rank of Bandit.
You have restored your honor within the Thieves Guild. Now I can pay you for your recovering the taxes and promote you to the rank of Footpad.
We will make sure each person on these tax rolls gets their money back.
Can you believe that fool even bothered to collect this paltry sum? You can keep it. I merely wanted the Watch know they went too far.
This will help to erase the stain on the Thieves Guild. Here is the reward the Gray Fox promised you for fetching those boots.
It's about time. I guess I have to reinstate you now. Try not to repeat this mistake in the future.
I am now allowed to grant you a promotion to Master Thief. Congratulations, I suppose. Be ready if the Gray Fox should need you again.
I accept this blood price and welcome you back into the Thieves Guild. I oughta break your neck though. Don't make this a habit.
Then we are done.
Then this conversation is over.
Then it is time for you to leave.
I have no desire to speak to you until the blood price is paid.
Then leave.
You are a rogue hunter. Membership in the Thieves Guild is denied. Leave me now.
Then leave me alone until you do.
We should not speak of this again until you can pay the blood price.
Then get out of my sight until you do.
Then begone.
Then get out of here until you can.
You have the blood price?
Do you have the blood price?
Are you prepared to pay the blood price for unwarranted kills?
Are you prepared to pay the blood price you owe?
Are you ready to pay the blood price for the murders you committed in Cheydinhal's Chapel?
Will you pay the blood price?
Are you here to pay the blood price?
Are you prepared to pay the blood price?
Yes, the Float is quite a vessel, don't you think? The only functioning tavern and inn on the water in all of Cyrodiil.
Bought it maybe ten years ago when it was decommissioned. Had to gut the whole thing to make room, but kept it seaworthy.
All the furnishings were built inside the ship since they were too big to be carried on board. Spared no expense.
She's ready to sail, don't worry about it. We'll get you back home in one piece.
The Float has three decks. This deck is the inn deck, the next level up is the tavern deck and then there's the top deck.
The supposed leader of the Mythic Dawn cult. He wrote the infamous "Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes."
The "Commentaries" are contemporary with Tiber Septim, over 400 years ago. So he is unlikely to still be alive, although you never know.
The Master is preaching in the Shrine as we speak! Hurry, you should not miss the chance to hear the Master's words!
The Master knows the secret mind of Lord Dagon. He speaks with Him and teaches us from His holy book, the Mysterium Xarxes.
You are fortunate indeed, to have heard the Master preach at your initiation!
Mankar Camoran lives in his palace, Carac Agaialor, which overlooks the Savage Garden from the top of the mountain.
He never comes here. He stays in Carac Agaialor with Ruma and Raven. But these caves eventually lead to the Terrace of Dawn in front of his palace.
Wait. I know who you must be. You're the one who killed Raven and Ruma. They told me about you, when I was still in their father's favor...
And now you're here to kill their father. Of course. You came for the Amulet of Kings.
Then ... Martin Septim still lives? There is still hope to stop Mehrunes Dagon's invasion?
Can you really do it? Can you bring this eternal nightmare to an end?
Can you defeat Mankar Camoran? And free all the souls of the poor fools who followed him?
Listen, I can help you. You need my help if you are ever to leave the Forbidden Grotto.
Thank you kind sir!
Thank you kind lady!
Go find him yourself.
Lex has pulled city Watchmen from the Arcane University and the Temple district to scour the Waterfront.
Last I heard he was in the slums by the north end of the docks, overseeing the operation.
Greedy bastard, aren't you. I like that in a thief. You'll have to see S'krivva about that. I'm just running the scam.
Good question. I want you to spy on Hieronymus Lex. Make sure you stay close enough to overhear any conversations.
Sooner or later they will order him to return the guards to their original posts. When that happens, come and tell me.
You have the Icestaff?
That's too bad.
Fair enough. Fathis is also the wizard in the tower southeast of town. He keeps his most treasured items there, not in the castle.
Only Fathis can open the door to the tower, but there is supposed to be a secret passage somewhere in the castle that leads him to his tower.
He's the court wizard. He has a room in the north wing.
Gloomy fellow. I've heard he consorts with daedra. I'd steer clear of him if I were you.
What are friends for? Fathis is also the wizard in the tower outside of town. He keeps his most treasured items there, not in the castle.
Only Fathis can open the door to the tower, but there is supposed to be a secret passage somewhere in the castle that takes him to his tower.
Everyone knows he's the court wizard. But I reckon you want to know more. Is it worth a few coins?
Right. I'm told it's a place where old priests care for moths that spin silk.
Ah, fresh bread tonight! The Moth Priests live in the Imperial Palace. I don't know exactly what they do. Something to do with the Elder Scrolls.
When they are too old or too blind to work, they are sent to the Temple of the Ancestor Moths.
What I've heard is that they live in total darkness in a secret underground labyrinth.
They are masters of fighting in the dark. If you intend to visit, make sure you bring lots of torches or a lantern or something.
Anything for a friend. The Moth Priests live in the Imperial Palace. I don't know exactly what they do. Something to do with the Elder Scrolls.
I've heard of it. Are you willing to make a donation?
Can't say I know of any.
That will do. Look for a man known only as the Stranger. He lives here in Anvil, near the Mages Guild.
He's out and about in the morning, so I would wait until afternoon or evening to go visit him.
There are none in this city. You might want to try in Anvil.
Well, only because I like you. Look for a man known only as the Stranger. He lives here in Anvil, down the road from the Chapel of Dibella.
I might know of one. Can you spare a few coins?
Hieronymus Lex has indeed been reassigned. However, you have slain needlessly to accomplish that goal.
The hunter is cast out of the pride. You are no longer a member of the Thieves Guild until the blood price is paid.
Well done, hunter! Hieronymus Lex will no longer be a thorn in the paw of the Thieves Guild. The Gray Fox shows his gratitude.
You are being promoted to Shadowfoot, and may now use Orrin of Castle Anvil as your fence.
Hieronymus Lex is still in the Imperial City. Do not speak to me of this again until the letter is properly replaced.
Then what are you doing here? Come back when you have the money.
Here is the new List of Candidates. Hieronymus Lex has a glowing recommendation.
She lives on the west side of town. She is fond of the Three Sisters Lodge in the evening, but takes her midday meal at the Five Claws.
I know of her. What's it worth to you?
I seem to have forgotten where she lives.
And I can't help you.
She lives on the Waterfront. She's a late sleeper though, in bed from sunrise 'til noon. She hangs out in the Bloated Float after sunset.
Always glad to do a favor for you. She lives on the Waterfront. Wait 'til afternoon to find her. She sleeps from sunrise 'til noon.
Yeah, I've heard of her. I'm going to need a few coins first though.
I can help. The Earl of Imbel has a home in the Talos Plaza, on the inner wall.
He is an odd one. Keeps to himself mostly. Only goes out after dark. A real night owl.
I know of him. Would you... loan me a few coins?
The master is not at home. He is out in the city tonight, searching for his supper. If you value your life intruder, leave before he returns.
The master is... unavailable until nightfall. It would not be wise to disturb him. If you value your life, you should leave before he gets back.
He is somewhere in the house. Flee thief, while you still have the chance!
I am Gemellus Axius, his servant. Master Imbel has his home facing the central plaza of the Talos Plaza district.
He is a very private man and does not leave his home often. He has a rare skin condition that forces him to sleep during the day.
If you wish to contact him, wait until nightfall. Even then, I doubt he will receive you.
I heard he moved to Bruma. I'd look for him there.
You are most gracious. The Earl of Imbel has a home in the Talos Plaza, facing the center plaza.
That's not very motivational.
Then that's my answer.
She's hiding in Dynari Amnis' house in the Talos Plaza district. She's one of the few that escaped when Lex invaded the Waterfront.
She is hiding in Dynari Amnis' house over in the Talos Plaza district. She's one of the few that escaped when Lex invaded the Waterfront.
What's it worth to ya?
There is little time. Please prepare yourself as quickly as possible. The entire guild depends on you.
Then hear me, and hear me well.
Mannimarco will have what he seeks, but it will be his undoing at your hands.
With this gem in your possession, you will be impervious to his attempts to enthrall you. When he fails, that is when you shall strike.
When we are done speaking, you will take this gem, you will then seek out Mannimarco, and destroy him.
Get to him any way you can. It is your only hope for defeating him.
I have full confidence in you, and so I leave the guild in your care. When I am gone, you will be recognized as Arch-Mage and leader of the Guild.
Lead your fellow mages, and lead them well. The future rests on your shoulders. Farewell, my friend.
Amber is a resin found in root system tunnels and on Gnarls. When treated properly, it is especially suited to lightweight weapons and armor.
I, alone, know the ancient art of forging Amber. I can even craft you magical items.
Spirits of ancient souls are trapped in the Ore. Find it in old ruins. Also, Grummites are especially attracted to it.
It's a supple and flexible ore.  Yet it holds a good edge. I can shape the sharpest of blades from it. I can also create magical items.
Before my master passed on, she hid countless matrices in the world. There to soak up the magical essence of our world.
As my master has done, so will I, before I pass on.
Find me one of these matrices and enough Amber, and I will craft you a magical item.
Tradition dictates before each master smith dies, she hides these magical molds in the world. Like pouring salt into a wound.
Over time they soak in magical energies from the world around them. Like you suck blood from a cut.
Bring me a matrix and enough Ore, and I will forge you a new item and bleed the magic of the matrix into it.
I'd be happy to craft you Amber weapons, but you need to bring me Amber. Consult the information I have posted in the store for details.
What can I make for you today?
What is your desire?
I'd love to shape a weapon for you, but you don't have enough Madness Ore. Have a look at the info I've posted in the shop.
What shall I forge for you?
What do you wish?
Sometimes, a woman has got to make her point using the tip of her sword, right? You'd better believe it!
Mama always said, "You can tell a lot about a man by the sword he carries."
Carve a happy smile. Let the blood wash over your hands.
Sometimes a woman's got to swing a big stick to be taken seriously, right?
In your strong hands, a few good blows with this, and your foe will be dead in no time.
The great thing about bows is that they allow you to kill your foes without getting blood all over your dress. Here you go, dear.
An archer needs strong arms. I bet you could hold back that bow for quite a long time, couldn't you, love?
Think of me when you send arrows to bite into your foe.
The most important piece of armor. "Always keep your heart safe," Mama always said.
That's a big chest you've got there. You need any help getting this thing on?
Sure, you've got your rib cage, but a sharp blade can pry ribs apart.
Don't know why you'd want to cover up that gorgeous head of yours, but here you go.
Head wounds bleed profusely.
Sometimes a woman needs to make a quick exit. No shame in that. But it won't be very graceful if your legs are broken.
Here you go. I shaped these to your exact measurements. Need some help getting them on?
Important arteries flow through the legs.
A lady might be a killer, but she shouldn't ruin her manicure by chipping a nail.
You know what they say about the size of a man's hands....
When the blood flows across your knuckles, think of me.
Every girl needs a good pair of shoes.
You know what they say about the size of a man's boots....
Boots are useful. Though, sometimes, it's nice to wade barefoot through the blood of your fallen foes.
They say, "Behind every great man is a great woman." Mama said, "Men are squishy. Use a shield instead!"
Strap this shield onto that big arm of yours.
Properly timed, blocking can stagger your foe. That is the time to caress him with your blade.
Stick your foe with one of these pretty arrows.
These arrows will sink deep into your enemy's flesh.
He is the best fence in the Thieves Guild. He spends time in the guild hall, and in the Elven Gardens.
He is the best fence in the Thieves Guild. He operates from the Elven Gardens in the Imperial City.
Orrin is a respectable fence, if there is such a thing. He's got a decent amount of gold, but is a tough negotiator. Go to him instead of Luciana.
Luciana lives in Bravil. She is a decent fence. Better than Ongar and Dar Jee at least.
Dar Jee lives in Leyawiin. He doesn't have much money, but he's got more than Ongar.
Ongar lives in Bruma. He doesn't have much money, but he's the only place you can sell hot property if you are new to the Thieves Guild.
Yes. I buy stolen property. Shall we negotiate?
Look no further. I'll buy your hot goods.
Right here. I'm the best in the business. You've gained quite a reputation in the guild. Let's see what you've got to sell me.
The best fences are only available to the higher rank Thieves Guild members. Here's a list of who you can use.
I can handle some types of stolen property. Whatchya got?
What, I'm not good enough for you? You think Fathis is going to give you the time of day?
I'm just as good as he is. Show me your stuff. I can move anything.
Jobs? We're thieves, not masons or scribes.
Look, you're on your own as a thief. Go find a likely looking house. Case the joint to see when the owner is gone.
When he leaves, you break in and steal some stuff. You don't need special permission or orders to do that.
However, you will find that you can only sell stolen property to one of our guild fences. Most other merchants won't take hot merchandise.
Talk to Jensine. She can help you better than I can.
That guy is going to run me out of business soon. His prices are so low, I don't know how he does it. I think he's up to something.
If you're interested, you should head over to Jensine's "Good as New" Merchandise. She heads up a committee that is trying to investigate him.
Jensine is running the show. She will get him but good.
I cringe whenever that name is mentioned. His inventory has to be stolen or something, because his prices are so low, they're below my cost.
At this rate, I don't know if I can keep my doors open. All the people are spending their money there. Bah.
If you want to help out some poor merchants, head on over to Jensine's "Good as New" Merchandise. She'll fill you in with the details.
Thoronir didn't turn out to be such a bad fellow after all. I'm glad he decided to join the Society.
Well... maybe Thoronir wasn't responsible for digging up those corpses, but good riddance to his insane prices. Nice job.
Jensine is the lady you want to speak with about Thoronir.
He is dirty. Plain and simple. I don't trust him at all. Won't even come to merchant meetings and sets his prices so low, he undercuts everyone.
If you want to give me a hand, go speak with Jensine at her "Good as New" Merchandise store. She can clue you in and maybe offer some coin.
The Society triumphs once more! Thanks to you, of course.
Well done! This shovel will certainly confirm Agarmir's crimes. Along with the manifest, it should prove useful to the City Watch.
In your absence, Thoronir visited and we spoke at length about his role in this scheme. I believe him when he says he didn't know Agarmir's sources.
He told me of his intentions to donate all of the money and inventory to the local temple. He also agreed to buy and sell merchandise at fair prices.
Last but not least, he's officially joined the Society.  I am taken aback by his honest intentions.
In return, the Society has decided not to press charges. His name will be absconded from the records of this crime.
Now, I'm sure you are waiting to hear about your reward. The Society thanks you for everything you have done. Please, take this gold.
Many thanks, on behalf of all of us.
Speak to Thoronir first. Although I am happy you were able to recover some solid evidence, he deserves to see it as well.
Now that you have the manifest, you'll need one more piece of evidence that proves the theory that links Agarmir directly to the crime.
Look for something in his possession that can be linked to his crimes, and we will have him.
Be ever vigilant. The crime of grave robbing is punishable only by death, so Agarmir is likely to do anything to keep his crimes secret.
Thoronir better pray he had no knowledge of Agarmir's grave robbing, or the Watch will have his head.
I've checked my sources, and no one knows this "Agarmir"; he's probably using a false name.
Good, you have found his source. Now, you must find where his source gets the materials if we are to truly bring this crime to justice.
Be careful, there is no telling what this "Agarmir" is up to.
I told you he wouldn't cooperate. Your best bet is to shadow him and see where he goes.
I hope you're more successful uncovering his scheme than we've been.
So, Ogier sent you, eh? Well then, he usually sizes up people well, so you may be just what we're looking for.
So, Tertullian sent you, eh? Well then, he usually sizes up people well, so you may be just what we're looking for.
So, Claudette sent you, eh? Well then, she usually sizes up people well, so you may be just what we're looking for.
I think you may be just the kind of person we're looking for. Perhaps you can assist us with a problem we're having here in the Market District.
Don't know anyone by that name. Now go away.
I'm mature enough to admit I was mistaken about Thoronir. He's a welcome member of our group in the Market District.
Very well, I see little harm in telling you.
After a bit of reading in the garden and running my special errand at noon, I like to shop at Books of Bliss.
Around 8 p.m., we are served dinner. Gundlar is quite a chef and prepares Thadon's meals personally, adding just a hint of Greenmote.
After that, we dance, we sing, or we do whatever else suits my lord's tastes.
At the risk of being rude, I must confess I don't like talking about the specifics of my routine.
Thadon has too many enemies that may turn that knowledge against him. He depends on me quite dearly.
Well, yes. Apart from enjoying his painting, reading a good book, or a rousing night of erotic bedroom games?
I'm speaking of Greenmote, of course! There is no greater pleasure.
If I didn't have such a busy daily routine, I'd likely indulge myself in its pleasures more often.
There isn't enough gold or enough jokes in the world that would convince me to tell you where the Greenmote is located.
Greenmote is the refined version of the spores that are harvested from the spore trees that dot Mania.
We keep the Greenmote safely tucked inside the Greenmote Silo. You can imagine the ruckus if its location was known.
Only a select few, such as myself, know the Silo's location. However, we are sworn to secrecy.
I've heard of such a grand place. Ahhh... to imagine all that wonderful Greenmote under one roof.
Stay away from Greenmote. Your enemy will just use it to lull you into a false sense of security before he strikes!
She is leading what is left of our forces. She waits for you outside Pinnacle Rock. Please hurry to her before it is too late.
She has taken up control of what little force we have left. She waits for you outside Brellach. Please hurry. There's not much time.
Adeo sent me as a messenger to find you. Pinnacle Rock is under attack, and she needs your assistance at once!
The forces of Order have overwhelmed us, and forced us from the stronghold. We must regain control!
A messenger, sent by Issmi. You must go to Brellach at once! We are under attack!
The forces of Order have taken control. We must get back into the stronghold!
Our stronghold at Pinnacle Rock is under attack! The forces of Order broke in and routed us! You must go to Adeo at once and aid her!
Our stronghold at Brellach is under attack! The forces of Order broke in and routed us! You must go to Issmi at once and aid her!
Lord Sheogorath will, I'm sure, be quite interested to hear of your success. Return to Him once you've checked with the commander here.
Your Grace has noted the chimes around the Wellspring, I assume. If one chime is insufficient, perhaps all four chimes may be enough.
If they all ring at the same time, that may shatter the crystals that have polluted the Wellspring.
Consider that combat is not your only option. Your Grace has already made use of the chimes found in Brellach, and they can be useful once more.
If the Wellspring can be restored, your allies can return to aid you.
The Wellspring is an essential link between the Golden Saints and the Shivering Isles. Thadon knows this, and is likely trying to break it.
Your Grace has restored the Wellspring, and saved us. For this, we thank you.
The Waters of Oblivion lead us to the Wellspring, where Lord Sheogorath has given us a place to return to His service.
Consider that combat is not your only option. Your Grace has made use of the chimes within Pinnacle Rock already, and they can be useful once more.
The Wellspring is an essential link between the Dark Seducers and the Shivering Isles. Syl knows this, and is likely trying to break it.
Your Grace has restored the Wellspring, and saved us. For this we thank you.
Make all possible haste in reaching Dylora. She will be able to better inform you as to what happened, and what is required to secure Pinnacle Rock.
Do what you can to ensure the survival of your allies. They will be useful to you.
If Pinnacle Rock is indeed under attack, you should prepare yourself for a difficult fight. The forces of Order must be quite powerful.
What would you have me tell you about it?
It is our home, our sanctuary in the Shivering Isles.
If we were to lose it... my kind would be doomed.
Our fortress and sanctuary here in the Shivering Isles.
Make all possible haste in reaching Staada. She will be able to better inform you as to what happened, and what is required to secure Brellach.
Do what you can to ensure the survival of your allies. They will be most helpful to you.
If Brellach is indeed under attack, you should prepare yourself for a difficult fight. The forces of Order must be quite powerful.
Brellach is our stronghold. It is our place of refuge in this Realm.
It is closed to mortals. Your presence here is... unusual.
Our home and sanctuary here in the Shivering Isles.
She is our commander. She leads us. Without her, we are at a loss. I have done what I can to take her place, but I know I am insufficient.
Order has kept her hostage so that she cannot return to us and lead us. If we can free her, she may know how best to defeat them.
Syl let them in. More than I could count. It was all we could do to fall back and regroup out here.
We must free Dylora as soon as possible. She will know what to do.
Thadon let them in. More than I could count. It was all we could do to fall back and regroup out here.
We must free Staada as soon as possible. She will know what to do.
Thadon had her called aside, separating her from the group. He meant to divide our numbers when Order entered, making us easier targets.
They imprisoned Staada somewhere within Brellach. If they killed her, she could return to us through the Wellspring, so they keep her hostage.
If we follow the waters of the Wellspring, we will surely find her.
The Howling Halls are home to Ciirta's "Apostles of the Light," or whatever it is that they're calling themselves these days.
These zealots believe her to be some sort of savior, or deity, or something. Their doctrine is very confusing.
The most useful thing that I can tell you about Ciirta's followers is that they will not harm anyone who is wearing their robes.
Hundreds of years ago, this very building once served as a temple in Cyrodiil that sought to "cure" the mad.
It was in this temple that Emperor Pelagius was taken during his madness. After his death in these very halls, the temple was destroyed.
We stole the stones from Cyrodiil and reassembled the temple here in the Shivering Isles.
A lot of history has this place. It was I who led the apostles to steal the stones from Cyrodiil when the original temple was destroyed.
We rebuilt it here, as it was when it hosted its most famous guest. Sometimes at night, I can still hear Emperor Pelagius screaming.
She is an interesting character indeed. She is one of the very few individuals in the Shivering Isles that is party to the secret of Sheogorath.
She once made her way into the throne room during the Greymarch and saw that Sheogorath was nowhere to be found.
However, she did not recognize this event for what it was. She believes that Sheogorath had abandoned the Realm out of fear of Jyggalag's attack.
So while she is party to the secret, she does not know its significance. She believed Sheogorath to be a traitor to His people.
She believed it so strongly that she led a revolt against Sheogorath when He returned. She was imprisoned in the Howling Halls for her trouble.
Her... her light has gone out. What will we do now? Are we damned to walk in darkness forever? Who will lead us?
Ciirta is the lightbringer. She has seen things that we can only imagine. If you are to join us, you must speak with her.
Ciirta guides us to the light, but... her obsession with Sheogorath keeps us from achieving it! Ra'kheran, now he -- I've said too much.
At last! We are free from Ciirta and her madness. Hail to Ra'kheran, the lightbringer!
Ciirta's light has been darkened. Now is the time for another to rise and stand in her place.
I thank you for your help in killing her. Now, I can lead my people towards the light.
Ciirta is a fool, and a liar! She allows her hatred for Sheogorath to interfere with our journey toward the light! She must be stopped!
I understand that she is no longer with us. The apostles will need another to lead them to the light. Now is my chance!
Then you will die!
And my eye is required to create an artifact, isn't it? Very well then. I have survived greater threats than you.
Come then, and I will show you that in the end, my light shall shine the brightest!
My eye? You seek to remove the light from me? Why?
I could not abide Sheogorath's betrayal. He brought disharmony. He allowed the Greymarch to take us.
I gathered those who could see the light and I led a revolt against him. We were... slaughtered by his Dark Seducers. I alone was spared.
And in sparing me, Sheogorath made His final mistake. In this place, I will gather a new army and dethrone our coward god once and for all!
He is? Then the Greymarch has begun again? If that is so, then why are you here?
I did. When the Knights came, I fled to the city. As they marched and burned everything to ash, I found a way into the palace.
I sought Sheogorath. This is His Realm, and I knew that He would protect us. And what did I find? The Throne of Madness -- empty!
Sheogorath had fled! Left us all to die! I hid as the doors to the throne room burst open.
I... I don't remember what happened afterwards. I woke up in the marshes and fled underground.
Very well then! I will send you to darkness!
I sense why you have come. I can hear it in your very breath. You came as a herald of the false god Sheogorath.
I know His secret. I have seen His empty throne -- seen it with my own eyes while New Sheoth burned in the grey fires of Order.
Sheogorath refuses to protect us. Madgod? Bah! The Greymarch brings darkness. We seek light for all.
Forgive me for saying so, Your Grace, but I find taking orders from the Duke of Mania to be... unsettling.
You are the only remaining Duke, which is a situation quite unprecedented. Normally, you would never be permitted to pass within Pinnacle Rock.
Given the need for swift action, the normal customs shall need to be overlooked for now. We shall be right behind you, Your Grace.
Forgive me for saying so, Your Grace, but I find taking orders from the Duchess of Mania to be... unsettling.
You are the only remaining Duchess, which is a situation quite unprecedented. Normally you would never be permitted to pass within Pinnacle Rock.
Forgive me for saying so, Your Grace, but I find taking orders from the Duke of Dementia to be... unsettling.
You are the only remaining Duke, which is a situation quite unprecedented. Normally, you would never be permitted to pass within Brellach.
Forgive me for saying so, Your Grace, but I find taking orders from the Duchess of Dementia to be... unsettling.
You are the only remaining Duchess, which is a situation quite unprecedented. Normally, you would never be permitted to pass within Brellach.
These gauntlets will keep your hands from being covered in blood and guts.
My, my, my... what big hands you have!
They say the heart anchors the soul to the man. Think of this while the heart of your enemy beats in your hand. Then squeeze.
Nothing pokes a hole in an argument like the pointy end of your sword.
Cutting a man apart, little by little... such sticky sweet victory.
Place this between you and your foe. Creates less of a mess that way.
This shield, like a true friend, is always willing to take a good beating.
Keep your hair from getting tangled in melee.
You know what they say about the size of a man's forehead, right?
The best way for a blade to slip into a man's brain is through the eye socket, ear hole, or through the nose.
A girl can always win an argument with a weapon like this.
Only a real man can swing this hammer around.
Men like a woman with pretty legs. These will keep your legs from getting all bruised up.
Want some help putting these on?
Such strong blood pulses through the legs.
The magic glow flatters your complexion, dear.
You'll look absolutely stunning in this. Maybe you'd like to give me a little fashion show?
The enemy's blade will glance across the smooth metal. A gentle caress.
A smart girl always keeps herself well out of harm's way.
You look like a man who can shoot straight and long!
With a gentle moan, this bow will yield to your pull. With a scream of delight, it will launch pain into your enemies.
These boots will keep your toes from getting smashed.
Crush the skulls of the fallen under your boots. Stomp out their eyeballs with your heel. Paint the floor red in a bloody dance.
I like how magic makes things glow all pretty-like. Light up your foe by sticking a couple of these in him.
It is a satisfying sound, when an arrow rips into flesh.
With the Pools cleansed, the Font of Madness will soon be restored. There's no time like the present to finish your journey towards godhood.
If I'm not mistaken, that's the traitor Thadon. Right there. I'm not normally a bloodthirsty man, but I wonder if killing him might be a good idea?
If I'm not mistaken, that's the traitor Syl. Right there. I'm not normally a bloodthirsty man, but I wonder if killing her might be a good idea?
You have one Pool yet to cleanse, and the traitor is still at large. These would seem to me to be your highest priorities.
All is not well here. The Gnarls are disturbed. Order is spreading among them, and thus into the Font. Find the Pools and stop the taint of Order!
Sheogorath's private sanctuary, where he would often meditate amidst the tame Gnarls that tend the roots.
Normally the Fountainhead is a peaceful sanctuary. But there's no telling what changes the taint of Order may have wrought.
Now, I fear that the Gnarls themselves may be accelerating the spread of Order throughout the Tree's roots. Be careful.
Somehow the forces of Order have poisoned the Pools of Mania and Dementia that feed the Font.
I suspect the traitor Thadon. Jyggalag has never had an original thought in his existence.
Be that as it may. You will have to enter the Fountainhead beneath the Tree and find the source of the poison.
Somehow the forces of Order have poisoned the Pools of Mania and Dementia that feed the Tree.
I suspect the traitor Syl. Jyggalag has never had an original thought in his existence.
This is true. Very little surprises me, but your successes against the advance of Order have left me astonished. Speechless.
Indeed, it is your very success that must have led Jyggalag to this unexpected avenue of attack. His usual approach is much less imaginative.
Yes. His agents must have found a way to poison the Font with Order.
Once the source of Madness becomes the Font of Order, Jyggalag has won.
Indeed. The Font is being Ordered. As goes the Font of Madness, so goes the Realm. Soon we will all be serving a new master.
Order. The taint appeared only a short time ago, but it has spread quickly. I fear that soon we will all be serving a new master.
You're having a bit of fun with me. Very good.
My Lord of course noticed the Font when you arrived in the Palace. The Font of Madness, in the middle of the throne room.
The Font which is unaccountably covered with crystals.
Then everything is as it should be. The Ritual was followed, the blood brought to the Altar...
The Font flows with the sap of the Tree of Madness, which it draws up from deep beneath the palace.
The Fountainhead leads down to the Pools of Dementia and Mania, where the insanity of the Realm's inhabitants settles.
Jyggalag's minions must have introduced Order into the very wellspring of Madness. You must cleanse the Pools, or Order has won the war.
Syl... the snake. She showed up, asked for a contingent of guards. Said there was trouble at the palace, and that we were needed.
We were so focused on organizing quickly that by the time we realized she'd let Order in herself, it was too late. We were split up and picked off.
But it doesn't matter anymore. The only thing that matters now is the Wellspring. We must reach it at once!
Thadon... the snake. He showed up, asked for a contingent of guards. Said there was trouble, and that we were needed.
We were so focused on organizing quickly that by the time we realized he'd let Order in himself, it was too late. We were split up and picked off.
My Lady! I am sorry, I did not realize...
Where is Thadon? Have you seen him? That traitorous coward!
Where is Syl? Have you seen her? That traitorous coward!
Your Grace! I am sorry, I did not realize...
The Wellspring of the Mazken. It's what links us to this Realm, where we return to the world from the Waters of Oblivion.
If Syl helps Order sever that link... my kind will be annihilated. The realm will be lost to us. We must get to the Wellspring and stop them!
I will follow your lead. The Wellspring is at the heart of Pinnacle Rock; follow the waters to reach it. I am yours to command, Your Grace.
The Wellspring of the Aureal. It's what links us to this realm, where we return to the world from the Waters of Oblivion.
If Thadon helps Order sever that link... my kind will be annihilated. The realm will be lost to us. We must get to the Wellspring and stop them!
I will follow your lead. The Wellspring is at the heart of Brellach; follow the waters to reach it. I am yours to command, Your Grace.
The Emperor's elite knights. They dedicate themselves to Talos above and the Septims here on earth.
The loss of the Emperor must be a terrible blow to them.
Yes, Baurus told you right. I am the Grandmaster of the Blades. We serve the Emperor and the Septim bloodline. Talos is our patron.
You wonder to find me here? Discretion is our watchword. Only a few of us have the honor to serve publicly in the Imperial Guard.
This fortress is well-supplied with arms and armor. Use what you need from the armory in the east wing.
If you need armor, weapons, or just a place to sleep, the barracks in the west wing is available to any of us.
The Blades are closely linked to the Order of Talos. We both serve Talos, of course, and many of our brothers are former Blades.
I myself was training as a Blade when I received the call to serve Talos in a different way.
Like members of my order, the Blades are devoted to the divine Talos. We honor them for their dedication and devotion.
My order is dedicated to the service of the Septim Emperors. We have failed in our duty to protect him.
We're the Emperor's bodyguards. Our job is to get him out of situations like this.
Although I admit, things are not going according to plan.
I am so worried about her. Please find her.
Caves run all beneath the town. Some natural, some dug over the years since we found the Deep Ones. Every house has an entrance now.
I don't know much. Never seen them myself. Our grandfathers first found them, I think, digging in the mines.
They helped us. Made us rich. But there was a terrible price. Blood -- and worse.
Yes, Your Grace.
What do you want to know?
I don't have time to gossip about the guild right now.
Syl had called her aside, separating her from the group. She meant to divide our numbers when Order entered, making us easier targets.
They imprisoned Dylora somewhere within Pinnacle Rock. If they killed her, she could return to us, so they keep her hostage.
Time is short, Your Grace. We cannot know when the next attack will come.
Very well. I have a feeling that we will not need to wait long for the next attack.
The enemy will be upon us soon. May the blessings of our lord protect us all.
I thank you for your trust. In your name and for the sake of the Shivering Isles, I shall not disappoint you.
Inspect the battlefield and provide what aid you can to the troops. Speak with me when you feel that they are ready for battle.
MAZKEN! Form up! For the sake of your sorry male hides, move! MOVE!
Are you prepared for battle, Your Grace?
Form up! By the Staff, we will not allow this town to fall!
Very well, Your Grace. I hope for all of our sakes that your experience is greater than my own.
Speak with the Mazken and tell them where you wish them to stand. Then speak to me when you are satisfied.
Speak with the Aureals and tell them where you wish them to stand. Then speak to me when you are satisfied.
None shall pass.
My sword shall strike true.
My aim shall be true.
My aim will be true.
I shall be an unbreakable wall.
They shall fall before my blade.
My arrows will cut them down.
Affirmative. None shall break the line.
Affirmative. They will fall before my sword.
Affirmative. They will fall before my arrows.
Well, sometimes the guild gets a special commission. You know. Guaranteed pay to 'acquire' certain items for special clients.
You should check in with your Doyen every once in a while to see if there are any commission jobs available.
Then best be on your way. You won't find it by standing around in here.
I never thought it possible. I mean... I had hoped... but to actually hold it in my hands. It's more beautiful than I imagined it.
Congratulations. I had a feeling you were the right person for the job. And it seems I owe you a reward.
This Akaviri ring was found with the messenger's diary. It awards the wearer with increased agility and resistance to harmful magic.
It's known as the Ring of the Vipereye. I hope it serves you well in your future journeys.
It doesn't become you to tell lies. If you've recovered the Madstone, please bring it back to me and you'll be rewarded.
The messenger's diary will make a nice companion to the Madstone in my collection.
I paid several scouts to try and find the ruins at Pale Pass before I hired you. They were only able to locate the first of a series of landmarks.
These landmarks are mentioned within the diary. The one referred to as Dragonclaw Rock has been located. I'll mark it on your map.
The rest is up to you. My scouts reported bitter cold and dangerous creatures in the area, so they couldn't proceed.
Be cautious, and return home soon. Good luck.
I'm not used to hearing no, but I admire your boldness. I won't force you to go, only to request that you reconsider in the future.
I'm sure the lure of my reward will have you back sooner than you think.
I had a feeling you'd accept. Good. Then let me tell you how you're going to find the Madstone.
I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins.
Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well.
I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site.
Not quite. The Army of Reman knew that the organized Akaviri forces were commanded from a hidden post in the mountains.
Rumors placed it in a snowy vale called Pale Pass. That's where Reman focused his attention.
As his forces fought their way across the Jerall Mountains, the Akaviri suddenly surrendered. It was assumed they were overwhelmed and gave up.
The only strange part was that the command post and Pale Pass were never found. It was dismissed as rumor and the Army of Reman celebrated.
It's come to my attention that the post did exist and it happens to be the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone.
Back at the end of the First Era, raiders from the continent of Akavir attempted to gain a foothold here in Tamriel.
At that time, the Empire was broken into smaller factions. Reman Cyrodiil decided to unify them and form an army to repel the Akaviri raiders.
The force became known as the Army of Reman. The two armies clashed in what's now northern Cyrodiil. The Akaviri were strong and well supplied.
But their greatest error was marching through Morrowind on the way to their objective and dismissing the response it would garner from Vivec.
They didn't count on Lord Vivec forming an alliance with the Trident-Kings of the Dreugh. From Morrowind, he struck at their rear flank.
Not only did this make the Akaviri fight on two fronts, it also cut off access to reinforcements and supplies from the sea.
Well then, history lesson notwithstanding, I hope you can recover the Draconian Madstone.
With the information you have given me about Pale Pass, it could take scholars many years to amend the history books.
Are you familiar with the history of Pale Pass?
The Madstone awaits, and so does your reward if you retrieve it.
If you retreive the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you game?
The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type.
The Madstone appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such.
Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.
The Madstone is finally mine. It's the pinnacle of my collection. Many thanks to you again.
Good point. Allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Countess Narina Carvain. I assume you've noticed all of the Akaviri relics I'm displaying.
Well, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history.
In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.
A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete.
I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone.
Yes, I did. After you saved me in Castle Skingrad, I vowed to join. I was having no luck on my own.
Now I am running errands for the Gray Fox himself. I owe you much for your help.
You're kidding. Everybody knows Nocturnal. She is the daedra lord of shadows. The Mistress of Mystery. The Saint of Suspicion.
Thieves Guild members revere and respect her power and influence. We give her blessing with the phrase 'may shadow hide you.'
You've seen the Spire in Passwall. It is believed to be a monument from times past but its true purpose appears to be more sinister.
It seems to be a source of power for these invaders. A... portal, or some sort of gate. I don't know.
If we cannot disable or destroy it somehow, I do not think that we can stop this invasion.
Whatever you did overloaded it and brought the whole thing down. It collapsed Xeddefen itself. I'm amazed that you were not killed.
It seems to be the source of their power. Grakendo Udico may know more.
It seems to be the source of their power. Aurig Desha may know more.
It is increasing the power of the obelisk somehow. If you can shut down the obelisk, the Spire shouldn't matter.
What? Here? Are you kidding? I'm not staying here! If you don't want to help me, fine. I'll get out of here on my own.
I'll do what I can to help. I... I like to hurt things. Maybe I can hurt these damned knights.
This town has stood on the edge of the Shivering Isles since they were borne from the mists of time.
For our purposes, it serves as a defensible outpost. That is, against typical enemies who can know pain, torment, and death.
Passwall has served as an outpost for our defense of the Realm for millennia.
For our purposes, it serves as a defensible outpost. That is, against typical enemies who can know fear, intimidation, and hopelessness.
It is my home. I... I feel so strange. There's this cold feeling inside of me when I think about what's been done. So cold.
I think... I think it might be... sadness? Why would its destruction make me sad?
The appearance of the Knights of Order heralds the beginning of the Greymarch. As Lord Sheogorath feared, our time grows ever shorter.
The Knights are relentless. We are the only thing standing between them and the total destruction of the Fringe.
They have been upon us for hours. They have no interest in our surrender. Only our deaths.
The Knights began arriving shortly after the spire activated. They seem to have no interest in pushing us back, only in killing those who resist.
We cannot talk now -- we don't have very long until the next wave arrives.
Even though I have served with these Mazken for decades, as the Duke of Dementia, it is your right to command the troops.
Command them if you will, or leave it to me. Either way, make haste. Our time is short.
Even though I have served with these Aureals for centuries, as the Duke of Mania, it is your right to command the troops.
I do have an idea how we might be able to stop them, but for now our primary concern must be our survival.
I've been losing Mazken with each attack, and I'm down to nothing but men. We are pinned down here. If we lose, the Gates of Madness will fall.
If the gates fall, the enemy will flood into the Isles. We will be helpless to stop them. Now that you've arrived, perhaps we can slow them down.

The Knights are relentless. They do not tire. They do not fear. And they do not stop coming.
They appear out of nowhere at the base of the Spire. We kill five of them, five more come.
We've lost too many of the Mazken already. I fear that we will not be able to hold the town for much longer.
We've lost too many of the Aureals already. I fear that we will not be able to hold the town for much longer.
Your insight is impressive. While we draw their attention here, you should be able to slip inside Xeddefen.
Once inside, search for the source of the Spire's power. It must be underground somewhere. Once you find it, destroy it.
Good luck, Your Grace. May the voice of the hidden guide you to the way.
Good luck, Your Grace. May the truth light your way through the darkness.
If we attempt to assault Xeddefen, Passwall will be overrun and we will lose the Fringe.
Additionally, our forces are dangerously thin. We have no idea what opposition may await us inside. A frontal assault is not an option.
Additionally, our forces are dangerously thin. We have no idea what opposition may await us inside.
I did, and she did not return. I can only assume that she was caught and killed.
I am not certain. But do not lose heart, I have an idea.
The ruins of Xeddefen run under Passwall. The entrance to the south of the town has been sealed for centuries.
One of my scouts reported that the ruins have been opened recently and a number of these Knights are now guarding the entrance.
She commands the Aureals here at Cylarne. She has just arrived with reinforcements from Brellach to end this stalemate once and for all.
Would that I could exact satisfaction upon you for that insult.
But I am honor-bound to guard the doors of Cylarne, and so I will stay my hand. For now.
So like a male. Too stupid to know when to cease his yapping.
You have great faith in my powers of forebearance. Do not test me further, mortal.
You are fortunate that my duty forbids me from satisfying my honor.
You will answer for that with your blood, mortal!
My pardon, lord. Receive this key, and with it free passage throughout the Shrine of the Flame of Agnon.
Each chamber presents two options. When you push the appropriate button, an event will unfold for the adventurers to experience.
One is physically harmful... usually lethal traps or creatures... something relished by the residents of Dementia.
The other choice is more mental. They are designed to make the adventurers lose their grip on reality, much like the residents of Mania.
Of course, the introduction of spore gas with the Mania choices helps as well.
Well, the dead will be disposed of, have no fear. That's my job.
Those that are lucky enough to merely go insane will be granted a place in the Shivering Isles as a permanent resident.
You'll know you're done when they lie dead on the ground, or they are out of their minds.
Of course, any of their possessions you wish to keep are yours for the taking. I'll make sure you get them when you're done.
Simple. Wait until the adventurers are in position, and then press a button!
If they survived, they will proceed to the next chamber, and so on.
It's really quite ingenious!
As the adventurers make their way through Xedilian's chambers, they will encounter choices that you make in these control platforms.
All you need to do is decide what becomes of the adventurers. Will you drive them insane or will you pull the life from their bodies?
What else can I answer for you?
The only thing we can do is let the adventurers complete a cycle through here. I'll be glad to help.
I assume Sheogorath gave you the Manual of Xedilian. You can consult it for more information, or I can provide instructions.
Ever since that wretched Gatekeeper was made, Xedilian became redundant. It fell into disrepair and was eventually all but forgotten.
After only a few years passed, the Grummites began moving in. Ghastly things!
They mistook the Focus Crystals for some sort of religious symbols, and removed them from their rightful places.
This rendered the Resonator inert and Xedilian completely useless. Luckily, you came along and placed Xedilian back into operation.
Yes, yes. I tend to ramble; you'll have to forgive me. If you have the Attenuator, then Sheogorath must have sent you.
Xedilian would normally have sent you back to the entrance when you stepped on the pad in the Resonator Chamber.
Since you're up here, I can only surmise that adventurers are already entering the dungeon as we speak.
The Resonator works by drawing adventurers to itself with a sort of magical "siren's call".
Sheogorath uses the Resonator to find the "cream of the crop" as he calls them; the best of the worst to populate the Isles.
Quite clever, eh?
A wonder of engineering, is it not?
Xedilian is the ultimate test of mettle for the foolhardy adventurer that dares trespass into the Shivering Isles.
What they don't know is that they're being drawn to their doom, courtesy of the Resonator of Judgment.
I'm afraid you've exhausted Xedilian's resources. This was the final chamber.
The third chamber of Xedilian is the Chamber of Anathema. Its contents are designed to make sure its the final encounter.
The adventurers will be subject to horrors beyond their imagination... visions of repugnance, death, and malevolence reside in this room.
If you wish to bring ruin to your victims, you may choose to animate some of the corpses and watch as they satiate their hunger.
Or, we can create the illusion of the adventurer dying and his spirit rising from his corpse. Good fun to be had for all!
Then, just as suddenly as we kill him, we revive the adventurer.There are few minds that can stand this type of torture.
The second chamber of Xedilian is the Chamber of Avarice.
The adventurers will have to overcome their feelings of greed as they set their eyes upon the huge piles of treasure locked behind that gate.
You may choose to spring a fire trap and cause them great harm as they stand before the gate.
Or, you can fill the chamber with hundreds of keys and watch them frantically search for the correct one. Always a crowd pleaser.
I will be happy to describe each chamber and explain the event that unfolds as we proceed through Xedilian.
This first chamber is the Chamber of the Gnarl.
At the touch of a button, you can cause a large group of tiny Gnarls to appear and attack the adventurers.
Or, if you're feeling merciful, we can have the group terrorized by a seemingly lowly Gnarl that instantly grows to twice their size!
The hallucinogenic spore gas we release into the chamber will help lull the victims into believing the creature means to kill them.
Don't worry, its bark is far worse than its bite. Hahaha!
As you wish.
Oh, sorry. I wasn't aware that being a courageous hero was a requirement around here.
Look, you may be a scamp's ass, but I'm offering you the chance to be the hero of Passwall.
Escort me out of here, protect me, get me home, and those people will praise you more than you can imagine.
This place is a nightmare! Knights everywhere, these priests, and whatever they've done to Felas!
Listen. Those people in Passwall need me. Can you imagine how they'd ever get along if I died down here?
Every time I look for a way out, I get twisted around and end up back here. But I'm too smart for them.
You seem to have no trouble, though. Look at you, barely a scratch! You'd be the perfect person to protect me!
Back to your positions! Don't break ranks! Hold! Hold!
Fall back! Mazken! Retreat! Fall back to the town center! Now! Now! MOVE!
Here they come!
Retreat! Retreat! Fall back to the town center! Now! Now! MOVE!
Reform! Back to your ranks! More are coming!
You're more intelligent that I expected from a mortal, and a male at that. Away with you, then.
Indeed. You'd best leave this place at once.
You'll have to do better than that, you mud-crawling sap-licking jumped-up reptile. Crawl back to your hole.
Dog? You greet me as a Breton, the mongrel race of Tamriel, motherless lackeys of every great empire that ever conquered your homeland?
You'll have to do better than that, you yellow-faced pointy-eared monkey.
You'll have to do better than that, you ashen-faced god-cursed product of a Daedra's bowels.
You'll have to do better than that, you yellow-faced prig, inbred arrogant pretender to everything that the Mazken hold as our birthright.
You'll have to do better than that, you pasty-faced mongrel of an upstart race. Back to the slave pens where you were bred.
You'll have to do better than that, you dust-dwelling goat-herder, pathetic remnant of infamous Yokuda.
Dog? You greet me as a fellow, then, you tusk-faced brute.
Did your human master let you off the leash? Crawl back under his table. Maybe he'll throw you a bone to gnaw on.
I expected better from you. Are you the one witless Khajiit in all the world?
Is that truly the best you can do? Your "wit" might be better suited to the Aureals across the way.
You're not very good at this are you?
Then you are free to enter the Shrine of the Flame of Agnon. This key will allow you passage through any door in Cylarne.
Yes... yes! Their commander, Kaneh, is gullible enough to take you at face value...
She will reveal all her plans to you, Sheogorath's emissary! Beautifully devious. It embarrasses me not to have thought of it first.
Very well... I shall be your guide to Cylarne, then. Proceed.
Then I am at your service. The Grakedrig Ulfri commands here. You will wish to speak to her at once, no doubt.
Ah! You are just in time. Go quickly. The Aureals may attack at any moment.
She is the Grakedrig -- commander -- of the Mazken here at Cylarne. She has never yet been defeated by the Aureals, despite their strength.
This should be easy.
Come on. Fight harder!
Why isn't he dying? Keep fighting men!
Fight like you mean it!
Okay. Hand over those keys or die!
You there! Stay away from the Gatekeeper. Let us handle this!
Mirel was very convincing as well...
Very well. We'll risk it. The Underdeep it is. May Sheogorath's divine madness possess us today!
Why Sheogorath sent us a male, I'll never understand. If you're going to help us take control of the Altar of Despair, you need to decide now.
Will you help us destroy the Mazken or not?
I can't hold off my attack much longer. If you're going to help us take control of the Altar of Despair, you need to decide now.
Don't you? If you don't, you might. You wouldn't fall for her, though. Not the type.
Opposites repel, strangely enough. All that pleasure and pain locked away now, as if it never happened.
Unfortunately, the Chalice is locked away as well. I have no wish to retrieve it myself, but fetching it might do you some good.
My head is positively throbbing now... can you see it? I need to lie down. Find someone to tell you the rest of the story. Get the Chalice.
Well, aren't you the clever one. Mind you don't get too full of yourself. You might explode.
A lovely little treachery. The Golden Saints almost beg to be betrayed, true, but still, you took that little bit of extra time to think it through.
Well, you did accomplish your task. There's no denying that the Golden Saints are defeated.
Spearing fish in a barrel might have proved a bit more challenging, but there's definitely something to be said for making it easy for yourself.
Betraying the Dark Seducers! The biters bit, so to speak. Most ingenious. I must say, I really didn't think you had it in you.
An impressive victory. After all, you handicapped yourself by making it as difficult as possible for yourself, and yet you still won. Congratulations.
I'm afraid you'll have to make up your own mind. Unfortunately, I'm just the hired help. I'm not paid to make the big decisions.
How to decide... Do you prefer glorious, and pointless, battle? Or the poisoned arrow striking home from ambush?
Do you like a stand-up fight? Or perhaps a bit of treachery is more your style?
Well, you've talked to one side. Perhaps a visit to the Dark Seducers is in order?
Don't be frightened, they won't harm you. They look much fiercer than they really are, I assure you.
Well, you've talked to one side. Perhaps a visit to the Golden Saints is in order?
The Flame of Agnon can only be lit by the immortal servants of Sheogorath: the Golden Saints and Dark Seducers of His creation.
In normal times, Sheogorath would simply command it and his servants would leap to sacrifice themselves upon the Altars of Rapture and Despair.
But, alas, the times are not normal, and Sheogorath has given you this task, without the authority to command it.
I'm afraid you may have to be a little bit clever.
It's what's used to light the Great Torch. Haven't we covered this? You'll find it in Cylarne, guarded by my Saints and Seducers.
Cylarne was once the capital of the Shivering Isles. Perhaps the first capital.
In any case, the Flame of Agnon here is always used to light the Great Torch of New Sheoth.
It has always been so, and presumably always will be so.
That's where you're going to get the Flame of Agnon. Do you listen to anything I say? Do your ears work? If not, I can find use for them.
Go and fetch the Flame. Bring it to the Sacellum. Light the Great Torch. How are you going to be Me if you can't even do what Me tells you?
I will show you the void!
Good. Good. Your face is known to me. One so famous as you cannot expect to walk around the Isles unrecognized, can you?
You are the Duchess, yes? And Sheogorath has sent you to find Ciirta, has he not? He finally seeks to kill her?
You are the Duke, yes? And Sheogorath has sent you to find Ciirta, has he not? He finally seeks to kill her?
Please to relax... we have a common goal. You see, I know that you have not come here to join us... Your Grace.
You have come to kill her, have you not? I can sense it all through you. You stink of violence. It is glorious!
Yes, I have heard of you. Tell me, is it true? Has Sheogorath sent you to kill Ciirta for her vendetta against Him?
Yes. Only then can I create an appropriate vessel to hold the power that is inherent in the lord of this realm.
The Staff may allow you to occupy the Throne of Madness, but understand that such a feat has never been attempted.
All sources indicate that you will fail. It is a certainty. However, I also predict that this will not stop you from trying.
Maybe they're just confused.
We'll be swimming in blood soon. Yuck.
Just as long as we don't catch any of their diseases. Adventurers always get strange diseases.
Just don't get any blood on me!
I tried to warn them.
They should have listened to me!
Let's go watch!
Come on,  it'll be fun watching them get knocked around up there. I'll lead, you'll follow.
Oh no. They're bleeding all over the place!
Yuck. Look at all the blood and gore. I'm getting out of here.
They should have listened to me.
Dead. I warned them, didn't I?
Why not? What is it you are waiting for?
You don't have the daggers yet? Time is growing short. Do whatever you must to get them!
You have them? Do you? Give them to me! I thirst for Ciirta's blood!
Tonight, the light will shine for us all. Tonight, Ciirta's time comes to an end.
You do? Give them to me, and we can start now! I did not think that it would be so easy!
Very clever, Your Grace. Bring to me three Apostle daggers. Ciirta must be slain with the weapons of the light if I am to take her place. No other weapons.
But you must be discreet. Do not remove the robes, or you will be attacked. Even I will have to kill you, so I do not draw more suspicion to myself.
And be cautious of killing my allies. I cannot forgive that crime. You will know them, as they are also forbidden to carry daggers.
Will you help me bring the Apostles to the light? And help yourself?
Do not be foolish. We can both get what we want. Come to me when you have made a decision.
Good. Good. Bring to me the daggers. Then kill Ciirta, we will.
I require weapons. For myself and for the Apostles that will help me do the deed. But Ciirta already is suspicious of me.
She has forbidden me and those who support me from carrying weapons. And suspicious would it look if we were to wander around gathering them.
Too long Ciirta has led us here. Always against Sheogorath! Always! But we are tired of her vendetta.
Ciirta brought us here with promises to show us the light, but always is about Sheogorath, is about revenge!
Ciirta lied, but when she is done, I will lead the Acolytes to the light!
Still, for whatever reason you are here, you mean Ciirta ill, yes? Don't bother refuting me, I know the truth. Yes, I do.
But, there are those of us here who want her gone as well, yes. Those of us who think that maybe we could lead better then she does.
So, if you will help me, I will help you. Ciirta will die and you will not need to lift a finger. Then you can take whatever you need and go.
I knew it! No one can fool Ra'kheran. I am the wisest here, more wise even than Ciirta. And that is why she must go, yes.
And you, if you help me, then you can have what you want and no need to risk your neck, yes?
Clever you are, but I can sense a liar. No matter, I do not care to know why you are here; I only care that you wish Ciirta harm.
I, too, want to see her dead. And others here have had enough of her, yes. We wish the light, and keep it from us, she does.
If you will help me, you can have what you want, and we can have what we want. Everyone is happy... except Ciirta.
Well, my child, how are you this evening?
My dearest, how are you feeling tonight, child?
I'm so glad to see you, my dear child. How are you?
I see you have been playing rough with the other boys. They are weak and you are strong!
Look at all the bones around you! You have been a busy little boy, haven't you?
I'm so proud of you, my child. You crush our Lord's enemies into dust.
Just looking at you reminds me of... Him. Why has He forsaken us?
You are strong like Him. I made you for Him. But still He refuses me. Why?
Seeing you warms my cold heart. Why has He forsaken us?
No, it's too much. I don't know why I keep coming to visit you!
I'm sorry child, it's just too much for me. I must leave now!
Why does it still hurt, after all these years? Why?
No. You mustn't come near me when I'm crying... you remember what happened last time you touched my tears!
No, not now! Don't you remember what happened last time you touched my tears? Keep away!
Stay away. My tears, they burn you! Don't you remember? Stay back, child!
You. Of course. Sheogorath's assassin.
So, the bloody-handed Duke comes to claim another victim!
So, the bloody-handed Duchess comes to claim another victim!
You may find me rather harder to kill than poor, innocent Thadon.
To think that I trusted you. You!
Sheogorath's pet. That used to be me, so blinded by my suspicions that I could not see the truth of my own situation.
But no more. No more!
If only I had seen it sooner. Thadon might stand here next to me, to help usher in the rule of Order to this benighted realm!
Instead, he is dead, at your hand. And Sheogorath's command!
What harm had he ever done to you? The means justify the ends, is that it?
Then you will appreciate my new master's methods.
Jyggalag is coming. He cannot be stopped. He will rule this land, and all our delusions will be stripped away.
None too soon. We have lived too long as the playthings of the Madgod.
Now, taste the power of the true Lord of this realm!
I see so clearly now, what a fool I have been. A happy, heedless fool.
How he must have mocked me, with my poems, and my painting, and my meaningless revelry.
If only I had seen it sooner. My beloved Syl might stand here next to me.
Instead, she is dead, at your hand. And Sheogorath's command!
I hope you enjoyed your reign, as it is almost at an end.
The Gnarls can help you. Those that have not been poisoned may be able to reverse the spread of Order. Do not slay them heedlessly.
It will be our great honor to fight by your side, My Lord!
With pleasure, My Lord! My Mazken will gladly die in Your service!
With pleasure, My Lord! My Aureals will gladly die in Your service!
Of course, My Lord. I meant no disrespect. My zeal in the Realm's service got the better of my judgment.
The situation is this. An Obelisk of Order has activated in the Palace courtyard. My Mazken are engaging the Knights as we speak.
We will defend the Palace to the end of our strength, and will cast ourselves in the path of cursed Jyggalag himself should he come here.
The situation is this. An Obelisk of Order has activated in the Palace courtyard. My Aureals are engaging the Knights as we speak.
Order. An obelisk has activated just outside the Palace. I've ordered my Mazken to engage the enemy.
I expect that this is the beginning of the final assault. The cursed usurper Jyggalag himself may even take the field before the end.
What are your orders, My Lord?
Please accept my pardon, Lord, if I gave you such a false impression. The fault is entirely mine.
The Autkendo merely wants you to know that matters of the gravest import to the Realm's security may be at stake.
If it please my Lord, she requested also that I inform you that time is of the essence, in her humble opinion.
I don't know, my Lord. She only said it was a matter of the gravest import to the security of the realm.
You fool! I am the light! Come if you dare, I will cast you into darkness for all eternity!
To the void we will send you. And without you, we will gain the light!
I come to relieve you of your torment, dear Ciirta. No more lost memories. No more pain. No more misleading us.
Ra'kheran! You come to me with blades drawn? What is the meaning of this?
Come! Now is the time!
Here you are, my brothers! At last, we will be rid of Ciirta!
Take these daggers! Slay her and at last, we can be on our path to true enlightenment!
Following each cycle of the Greymarch, Sheogorath has cast out or killed every aspect of Order found in the Shivering Isles.
I alone have survived. Sheogorath cannot bring himself to destroy the knowledge that I possess.
Instead, he has confined me to this place and forbidden me to die. I have not seen another creature until fate, predictably, sent you to me.
Instead, He has confined me to this place and forbidden me to die.
The great library was the height of logic and deduction.
Contained within its walls were the logical prediction of every action ever taken by any creature, mortal or Daedric.
Every birth. Every death. The rise of Tiber Septim. The Numidium. Everything. All predicted with the formulae found within Jyggalag's library.
When Sheogorath discovered the library he had it burned, insisting that it was an abomination and that personal choice defied logical prediction.
I am all that remains of the knowledge contained within the great library of Jyggalag.
Contained within its walls were the formulaic predictions of every action ever taken by any creature, mortal or Daedric.
When Sheogorath discovered the library, He had it burned, insisting that it was an abomination and that personal choice defied logical prediction.
Her Ladyship is rather suspicious of all around her. Best for you to not question it, and merely do what she requires of you.
As you command, m'Lord.
At once, m'Lord.
Gladly, m'Lord.
Look out! The northern Obelisk has been reactivated!
They've reactivated an Obelisk!
The priest has reactivated one of the Obelisks!
Ugh... What's happening?
Speak to each of the Mazken to give them orders.
The front line will arm themselves with axes of war. They will hold the line against the enemy's charge.
Those who you designate as archers will head to the rear and keep their distance when the enemy draws close.
Those with blades and shields will hold the flank. When the enemy draws near, they will close in and attack.
Where would you like me, your Grace?
Tell me where you would have me serve, Your Grace.
I hope you are as wise as you pretend to be. The Grakendo has lead us for hundreds of years.
I will obey your orders, but know that I do not trust the tactics of any male. Men are meant to fight, not to lead.
Speak to each of the Aureals to give them your orders.
Those who you assign as archers will head to the rear and keep their distance when the enemy draws close.
Where shall I stand, your Grace?
If your tactics are as bold as your words, we may live through this next attack.
Aurig Desha is wise. Duke or not, who are you to doubt her strategy?
At least you are a woman. I would hate to be lead to my death by some foolish male.
Conviction can drive men mad. They will even kill to uphold the mistaken belief that only they see the world truly. Such is the story of Vitharn.
The Fanatics? What's to understand? They were just after my power. But it's mine, all mine.
They wanted me to convert Vitharn, but I fooled them. I put them on the list. Oh, yes, they're on the list now!
Because we refused to convert, they lay siege to Vitharn. If they had agreed to let me rule, I would have helped them. But now they're on the list.
Do you seek to deepen my despair by reminding me of my greatest failure?
Four people failed in their duties that day, allowing the Fanatics to open the main gate. In the end, I failed with them.
At the moment of my death, Lord Sheogorath appeared. We had already earned His wrath for sins of pride.
He told me that the spirits of my people would remain bound here, replaying our cowardice, as a lesson to those that thwarted his will.
We tried to gather the townsfolk into the keep, but it was too late. I barely had time to find my betrothed and get us inside.
The gate was closed behind us. I heard the townsfolk pounding on the gate. But not for long, because then the screaming began.
I'm supposed to defend the courtyard against the Fanatics. I'm supposed to stop them from getting inside the keep.
Althel brought us the news of the invaders. I ran to the wall to see for myself. That's where I danced for the rain.
I saw them enter the sump and reservoir. I tried to warn the guards to bar the doors to the reservoir, but I wasn't in time.
The Fanatics caught us by surprise, attacking out of the Reservoir, killing the rear guard and opening the main gates. Now I do the dance of death.
The Fanatics are about to break into the courtyard.
It's a good thing I've kept all the weapons and armor in good condition. If I let those soldiers use them, they'd be all dented by now.
1, 6, 1. I was the first to spot the invaders. 8, 0, 3. I was on patrol when I saw their skirmishers marching toward Vitharn.
3, 9, 8. I rode back as fast as I could to tell Count Cirion of the danger. 8, 7, 4. He went and hid. 9, 8, 9.
14, 11. I must guard the lever that opens the gate. 9, 4. If the gate is opened, the Fanatics will overrun Vitharn.
Prior Dreth met with the Fanatics to turn them away. They did not see the wisdom of his words.
Instead, they sent soldiers to sneak into the keep. The defenders in the bailey failed to stop them from opening the main gates.
Indeed. Lord Sheogorath will be anxious to hear of your victory, I am sure.
Indeed. Lord Sheogorath will be anxious to hear of our victory, I am sure.
No sign of her yet. We'll do our best to track her down, and deliver her to Lord Sheogorath for a fitting punishment.
The traitor must be brought to justice!
Our warriors will scour the halls of Pinnacle Rock, removing any last elements of opposition. Then, we will immediately return to our duties.
Our warriors will scour the halls of Brellach, removing any last elements of opposition. Then, we will immediately return to our duties.
No sign of him yet. We'll do our best to track him down, and deliver him to Lord Sheogorath for a fitting punishment.
Death to the Fanatics!
Watch the gate!
Then, at the risk of being rude, could you please stop disturbing me? I'm very upset, and the last thing I need are false hopes.
Of course. I understand. Well then, I must be on my way. Perhaps someone else will come along who can assist me.
Oh!!! Thank you so very much! Here's the key to Rythe's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house.
Do hurry, I miss my love so much.
You haven't? That's strange. Rythe is known far and wide as one of the best painters in all Cyrodiil.
His speciality is setting the Great Forest to canvas. The paintings look so amazingly real that some say they can see the trees sway in the breeze.
That's a silly notion of course, but it just goes to show the attention to detail Rythe uses when he paints.
Rythe Lythandas is one of the greatest painters in all Cyrodiil. Sadly, he's gone missing. His wife, Tivela, is beside herself with grief.
My love is home again. I'll never leave his side.
Yes, my husband is the Rythe Lythandas. Have you heard of him?
I knew the secret of my success would be revealed one day. I can tell you all about the brush if you like.
I'll have to remember to remove the trolls from my painting before I complete this piece.
The trolls that the thief painted seem to have turned on their creator and killed him. He didn't know the Brush had its risks.
The creatures are now loose all over the forest and in the clearing where I was still working. The Brush is on the body of the Bosmer thief there.
I will not be able to help you; I am not a warrior. But take these bottles of turpentine, they might help. Do be careful.
The Brush allows the artist to paint from within a canvas. It opens a portal into which the artist may enter to paint things life-sized.
All the painter has to do is have the Brush in his possession, and whatever he imagines appears in the canvas.
Of course, I like to wave it around anyway, it makes me feel more like a legitimate painter.
I guess it all doesn't matter now. Unless you can defeat those Painted Trolls, we have no chance of getting the Brush back.
I was in my studio, when a Bosmer wearing dark clothing accosted me. Before I could call for help, he knocked me unconscious.
When I came to, I found that the door to my studio was still locked, and that the thief had snatched my paintbrush. That's when I saw it.
There was something on the canvas of my painting that I hadn't put there. It looked somewhat like a troll but it was badly done. Then it hit me.
The Bosmer must have leapt into the painting, then painted guardians inside to protect himself using the Brush of Truepaint.
Oh thank you! I knew there was good in you. Here's the key to Rythe's study. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be here.
There our brethren destroyed the vampire Dratik, but all were infected by the abomination, and were doomed to turn themselves.
It was then that Azura, may She bless our days, sealed the cavern, protecting the world from the monstrosities within. It has been sealed ever since.
The Great Lady has spoken... to you alone. The moon and star shall be your guide.
This is the shrine of Azura, Queen of the Dawn and the Dusk. What is your business here, traveller?
These are dark times, and people's minds are poisoned by rumors and superstition.
Unless you can persuade me of your good intentions, I cannot speak further on this matter.
Well, you're dressed for it, and you seem like a really good person. You can go in. Sorry to have bothered you.
I don't know who you are, and I'm not all that sure about you. But, you're dressed for it. Can't imagine dressing up for any other reason. Go on in.
Hmmm... don't know that you're dressed for it, but you seem a really likeable sort. I'll let you in. I'd better not regret this.
Right. A big, fancy dinner party. You seem likeable, but not so much that I'd just let you in there. And not dressed like that.
Look, it's a fancy party. You seem a fine enough sort, but not so nice as I'm going to just let you in there. At least not dressed like that.
This is a classy event. I don't know you. I don't like you. And you're not dressed for it, anyway.
Hallowed ground, home of the Forgotten Ones. A deep hole of shadow and despair. A truly wondrous place.
Blessed are the Forgotten Ones, Chosen of Namira. In squalor they thrive, wallowing in filth, low and repulsive, darlings of Namira.
A place of blessed darkness. A holy place where we may worship in our wretchedness. Why are you here?
First, never steal from another member of the guild.
Second, never kill anyone on the job. This is not the Dark Brotherhood. Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary.
Third, don't steal from the poor. The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox, particularly here on the Waterfront.
Stop whining, Methredhel. You'll get another chance soon enough. Why should the Thieves Guild turn down a recruit for stealing?
Methredhel, you have earned the right to join the Thieves Guild.
Thank you. You're truly kind to help someone you've just met. The only thing standing in our way are the painted trolls.
Very well. The Brush showed up several years ago in the possession an artist who was serving in the Arnesian War of 396.
It seems an errant fireball had exploded next to him, and he lost the use of both arms. He was a stubborn man who didn't want to give up his talent.
Being a devout follower of Dibella, he prayed to her for something that would allow him to express himself once more.
She heard his plea, and gifted him with the Brush. It's said the bristles of the Brush are woven from Dibella's own hair.
That injured man was my father. He passed the Brush on to me, and I intend to pass it along to my kin one day. Did you want to know how it works?
Well yes, of course. Why are you asking me these silly questions twice?
Yes. Rythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him.
He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally.
But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside!
I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone. Please. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried.
I will rest, but I must take care of our guest first.
Come, you must need food and rest.
If it wasn't for my friend here, you'd be right.
Rythe! Oh my love! You are home safe... I was so afraid...
Tivela!
Countess Carvain would prefer if you speak to her in person. She also said to present you with this stipend as a taste of things to come.
My Lady holds court from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening each day. That would be the best time to see her.
Then prepare for battle! I'll not let this fort fall to the dogs of Reman!
Well done, soldier. Your mission is complete, and you have my thanks. Now we may rest. Long live the Akavir!
Lies do not befit a soldier of Akavir!
How dare you address me that way, soldier! Your insolence will not be tolerated!
I don't think I'm going to make it!
I could use a hand here!
Why not? We can't just let those creatures live, and no one else is going to do anything about it, so we should get going!
Patience, Antus. He'll be here as soon as he can. Don't be so anxious to go rushing into battle.
Why isn't he here yet? What's taking him so long? He knew we were coming back for him...
Father's not scared - don't you dare say that! You'll see when he gets here. I'll ask him, and then you'll see!
I'm here because even though I'm afraid, I know that we have to do this. Father would feel the same way.
If you don't want to be doing this, then why are you even here? Father and I can handle this.
This is no joke, Antus, and it's nothing to be excited about.
I just can't wait. This is going to be the greatest fight ever!
Antus, calm down. We'll be leaving soon enough.
Then leave this place. Namira has no business with you.
You do? You are too pretty to worship in this place. People like you. Like to hear you talk. When you are more loathesome, you may return.
You do? Perhaps you should. You are repulsive, displeasing to the eye. Namira might find favor in you. Approach.
Don't worry, it will be very soon. Now get outta' here.
You cut back now, and I'm going to take my business elsewhere. Or maybe pay a visit to that Jensine and tell her about your little scheme.
You take what I get. I get notice at the last second, and I have to jump on it. No time to be picky about it.
Well, just shut up and listen to me. The next shipment will be sooner than I expected. Just have the money ready.
Shhhh, not so loud. How many time have I told you that?
Fine. You made your point. Contact me when you have the items, and we'll meet again.
Well, that Society is putting more pressure on me. So maybe we better cut back for a while.
Same assortment of things? I mean, I have enough clothing for now.
Sorry, I am not used to this kind of meeting. It always makes me nervous.
That you, Agarmir?
Well thank you! It's not only a fine assortment of goods, but a bit of a treasure trove; you never know what I'll have in stock.
I can see by the look on your face you wonder where I get all these fantastic items. I'll tell you what I tell everyone else who asks.
It's all about who you know. My sources are good, but they are secret.
Anyway, have fun looking around, and when you are ready to buy, give me a shout.
Yes, you do that. And in the meantime, I'll decide what to do with all of these ill-gotten things. I'm so sorry.
Yes! That's the least I can do.
First and foremost, I will never meet with him again. I can promise you that. Secondly, I remember him mentioning a place he had to be this very day.
Ummm... yes. That's right. He said that he wouldn't be able to do anything else, as he had something important to do.
You don't think he would dig up another... oh no, he wouldn't. But I guess he has been. Oh my. What have I done?
What? Oh... err, no. I'm afraid not. No sign at all.
It was a good idea, wasn't it? I wonder how long she'll spend trying to figure out where she put it down.
You've got Jeanne's book, I see. All right, then. I'll just take that from you.... Meet me here in the living quarters just after 10 PM.
You've got Jeanne's book, I see. All right, then. I'll just take that from you.... Meet me in the living quarters just after 10 PM.
Just go unlock Jeanne's desk with that spell I taught you.. Find her Manual of Spellcraft, and bring it here to me.
Her room should be easy to find. It's the only one upstairs that has a door. Just one more privilege she doesn't deserve.
Heh. Really, you're going to love this.
I'll teach you a spell to unlock things. What you need to do is get into Jeanne's desk, and bring me her Manual of Spellcraft, okay?
Her room is upstairs; make sure no one sees you. You do that for me, and I'll make sure you can find J'skar.
Well, it was fun while it lasted. I'll have to start thinking up something new to try.
You are a damn fool.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but you have a sick mind. Get away from me.
The very thought of what Agarmir was doing sickens me. I hope those poor souls rest in peace now that this is over.
Words... fail me. I knew that Thoronir obtained his goods through dark dealings, but I never would have imagined this.
As sickened as I am, I will not tell the City Watch until you have confirmed this theory and brought us the proof we need.
By the Divines... I can't believe this! They would dare defile the dead to make a profit? The City Watch will hear of this.
You should take this book to Thoronir. Confronted with this, he may just see things differently.
Without any solid evidence to back that accusation up, you don't have cause to assume that is where Agarmir gets his merchandise.
I hope everyone can forgive me for not doing a better job checking up on my sources.
You just take care of Agarmir, and I will be sure these things are disposed of properly.
I... can't believe what I'm seeing in this book. I'm mortified. To think these things here were once on the bodies of the recently deceased.
It's just too horrible to comprehend. I don't even know what to say. I guess an apology is not enough. What can I do?
Are you implying that my merchandise comes from the deceased?
Your story is ridiculous. This sounds like some lie created by Jensine and her damned "society" to have me run out of town.
Please... if you don't want to buy something, then just leave. Your wild accusations are upsetting me.
Well, that would be a trade secret. I can't divulge how I pass the great savings on to you, now can I?
Just like a baker not revealing his best recipes, I must keep my sources anonymous or every merchant in town would use them.
Suffice to say, they are quite reliable and low cost. That way, you walk out with a full coinpurse!
You have some nerve! Where do you come off accusing me of something you know nothing about?
Now, either buy something or get out.
I would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night.
Touching a vampire, or even the corpse of a vampire, can result in infection. Do be careful! If you want to know more, browse our library.
Vampires rarely live alone. They tend to have others of their ilk around them for protection.
Vampires have a weakness to fire. You may wish to use this to your advantage.
The vampire cannot exist in the daylight for long. As the sun's rays strike his flesh, it will burn as if on fire.
Horrid creatures. I hope we never see one in the Imperial City again.
As you know, the vampire can't remain in sunlight. I'd wager that you'll never see Seridur outside during that time of day.
I suppose you must decide what to do. Are you going to kill me?
Vampires? Why would you ask me about those filthy creatures?
At least there are a few less vampires in the world now. Well done. But there are more of these creatures that still roam Cyrodiil.
If any of our books can help you in the cause of destroying more, you're welcome to read them.
Since you're an honorary member of the Order, if you bring back proof you've slain a vampire, we'd be glad to compensate you.
Bring back the vampire dust from their remains. That should be proof enough.
Excellent! Another vampire has been slain. Here's your reward.
Return to me when you have slain another vampire, and the Order will gladly reward you.
I'm afraid there isn't much more I can tell you. Perhaps one of our books can answer any more questions you may have?
Normal weapons won't harm a vampire, they must be enchanted. Make sure you're equipped with such an item.
I've learned some more information. Vampires are immune to paralysis spells and common diseases. I hope that helps in some way.
It's said that the bite of a vampire has the chance of infecting the victim. If this occurs, they'll become a vampire in a few days. Be cautious.
Vampires? Hahaha! You have been speaking to Gilen. That silly old man keeps reading books about those creatures.
I hope he hasn't gotten you wrapped up in some foolish errand.
You may want to see if Grey-Throat or Gilen have done more research.
I believe that Grey-Throat and Gilen may have more information for you regarding these creatures.
Vampires are nasty creatures. They drink the blood of others to conceal their true nature. Such trickery makes them difficult to find.
You may ask Gilen Norvalo or Grey-Throat about these creatures as well. They've learned much.
Our goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now.
It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident Roland Jenseric is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim.
That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.
Our library is yours, friend.
He'll make a fine replacement for Seridur. It's the least we can do.
Ashame he wasn't there. I thought that you'd be able to put an end to this madness.
If I were you, I'd go to the cabin in the daytime. That way, if he begins to overpower you, the outside can be a sanctuary.
Roland was very much the loner. He never married, and was rarely seen outside his house. I'm surprised his secret wasn't discovered sooner.
I'm pleased to call him brother.
A shame he had to die. Before he turned, he was a fine man.
The Order welcomes him.
I knew it. Like I said before, a vampire wouldn't hide in a cabin. It'd be more like a cave or some other dank place.
Odd. A cabin is an unusual hideout for a vampire. They prefer dank caves and the like. Much darker and no need to block out windows.
Roland was always a quiet man. It was only recently he'd met that young lady. Poor girl. We must avenge her death.
Don't really know him. He lives across the way from Seridur I think.
He's a fine man, and an honored brother.
I never would have guessed that Roland was a vampire. I could have sworn I saw him walk in daylight.
If you wish to find out more about Roland, try asking Gilen or Grey-Throat, they knew him.
I wasn't aware he had a cabin outside of the city. Perhaps that's where he lures his victims. Be careful, he may have others with him.
I'm afraid we cannot go with you to this remote location. Fighting is not our specialty. Watch yourself... vampires are known to be crafty.
His home is located in the Temple District. Right across the garden from my home in fact. Ironic, isn't it?
A few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed passed Roland's house I heard a cry.
I rushed into the back garden to find Roland struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong.
He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp.
I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. Roland was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck.
That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs to you to track him and destroy him.
We shall never speak of him again.
Splendid. Watch your step.
Likewise. Sorry to send Gilen's wife to get you in that manner, but it seemed safer if we weren't seen on the streets right now.
If you'll come with me.
Hmmm. He must have known we'd look there. Search around town and see if you can find any more information.
Thank you. I'm happy you gave me a chance to explain.
Then, I'll fight you until my last breath. I won't surrender and admit to a crime I didn't commit!
I panicked. By the time I awoke, her body was gone. I knew Seridur was a respected member of the community.
They'd never believe he was a vampire. I retreated here to the cabin to collect my thoughts.
Yes. I must let someone else know. That night, I decided to follow Relfina. I wanted to see where she went on her walks.
When she stopped in the garden, and Seridur stepped out of the shadows, my heart sank. Then, suddenly, he was upon her!
She seemed entranced as he wrapped his arms around her and sank his teeth into her neck. I burst from my hiding place and attacked Seridur.
He became startled for a moment and tossed Relfina aside. She fell to the ground and I heard a sickening crack as her head struck a stone.
I was no equal to Seridur. He knocked me down in one quick movement. As I lost consciousness, I saw him laugh and then run away.
Now I know why he didn't finish me that night. He wanted to cast suspicions on me instead.
I - I'm sorry. I've been hiding up here in this cabin and I've forgotten my manners. Try and understand. I loved her, I'd never harm her!
Relfina was the love of my life. For the first time, I had a positive outlook. Then I saw Seridur looking at her with those coveting eyes.
When she started taking walks in the garden at night, I became suspicious. I didn't want to lose her. I should have trusted her... oh, Relfina....
He was a traitor. Thanks to you, the Order lives on. Long live the Order!
Seridur said we should meet without him for a few days. He said something about doing field research? I'm sure he'll return soon.
Seridur is an honorable man. Forming the Order shows just how much he cares about the Imperial City and protecting its people.
Let us never speak of that abomination again.
He's dead? Thank goodness! I feared I'd never be able to leave here, or worse, that he would come for me. I can finally return home.
The ironic thing is that I think the Order of the Virtuous Blood should continue its work. Perhaps I'll speak to the others.
Yes, I think that the Order will live on. Give me time to make arrangements, and meet me in Seridur's basement.
I know about Seridur and his "secret order." What better way for a vampire to hide than to pretend he hunts them?
You may want to speak to Phintias at the First Edition bookshop in the Market District of the city. I know he goes there occasionally.
I doubt that he's told Gilen and Grey-Throat anything, but you could always try.
I can't believe him! I knew he would try and pin this on me! If only I could get my hands on him...
I'm astounded that the very thing we decided to fight turned out to be in our midst.
Oh, I believe he left a message with Grey-Throat. Something about not being here for a few days?
Seridur? He founded this group a few years ago. I was impressed with his knowledge of vampires.
When we decided to make the group official, Seridur offered his basement as our headquarters. Quite nice, isn't it?
Seridur is a nice enough fellow. For an Altmer, that is. I think he and Gilen, and that Argonian, Grey-Throat, have some kind of a club.
They're very serious about it, but I'm sure it's just some boys night out kind of a thing.
Seridur? He comes in from time-to-time. Usually it's when he's out shopping. He always comes in with a large amount of travel food in his bag.
Then sometimes he buys a few books. I asked him once about it, and he said that he goes out of the city on business trips.
I think I overheard him once mention Memorial Cave to another patron of mine, but he never talked to me about it directly.
I'm not really at liberty to discuss my customers with stangers.
The Doyen are the hands and eyes of the guildmaster. You take your orders from them. You get your favors from them.
The current Doyen are Armand Christophe and S'krivva.
The Doyen are the eyes and claws of the guildmaster. As a hunter, you take orders from them, and you get your favors from them.
This one is a Doyen. Armand Christophe is a Doyen.
I am one Doyen and S'krivva is the other.
You are removed from the guild. You must pay a fine to one of the guild Doyen to get back in.
Breaking any of the three rules means expulsion from the Thieves Guild. If you commit murder, you must pay the blood price to rejoin the guild.
Blood price is for each person slain. You can pay any of the guild Doyen.
Those with blades and shields will hold the flank. When the enemy draws close, they will close in and attack.
Excellent. I knew you wouldn't disappoint the Order. Here's the reward that was promised. However, I must ask that you reveal nothing about us.
You've done a great service for the Imperial City, and you should be proud.
Then I'll be on my way. Meet me back at my home tomorrow evening if you'd like. For now, I need some time to myself.
Yes. It's outside of the Imperial City. I heard it's a place where many of the heroes from past wars are buried. Sort of a subterranean graveyard.
I just assumed Seridur had a relative that died and is buried there. Not many people go out there anymore, as the route is dangerous.
But Seridur is a stubborn one. Hehe. Takes integrity for a man to risk his own life to honor the fallen. I admire him for that.
I looked it up once in an old atlas I had in stock. Here, let me mark it on your map.
Thank you. I'm sure he'll be pleased. I must go now. Good day to you.
Thank you. Gilen always tends to exaggerate, but in this case he sounded earnest which worries me a bit...
He said to tell you that the matter he needs help with is of the utmost importance to the citizens of the Imperial City.
You're to meet him at Seridur's house which is located in the Temple District. He said all will be explained when you get there.
That's all he told me to say.
Thanks to you, his sinister plans have now been revealed to me.
I was sure he was part of the conspiracy. Sure of it. I guess it just goes to show ... well, we'll see what it goes to show, won't we?
He lives in the large house between the Low Gate and the East Bridge. Alone -- suspicious, don't you think?
Toutius Sextius, do you know him? A quiet fellow, appears harmless enough, but I've identified him as one of my key suspects.
He's a clever one, no doubt about it. Eyes in the back of his head, always seems to know when I'm watching.  But that's where you come in.
You should wait outside his house and see what he does when he's not watching me. I'll meet you here tomorrow night to get your report.
Do you know Davide Surilie? Yes, of the famous Surilie Vineyards. Pillar of the community, et cetera. Who would ever suspect him?
Perfect cover for the ringleader of the whole conspiracy! He watches my house constantly. You'll see.
He leaves his house early each morning. Watch him and report back to me here, at midnight as usual. Make sure he doesn't notice you!
Ah, of course. The gold. Here. But there is someone else I need you to investigate.
Yes, the gold that you value so highly. I wonder, what price betrayal ... never mind that. We shall see ... I do have one more name for you.
Here you go, my friend. Trust me, you've earned it. There is one last person that needs looking into, though.
Yes, of course, here is your precious gold. Now I need you to investigate one more person for me.
Here's the gold, as promised. I always pay my debts, and then some. Do the last .. task ... in that note, and I will pay you much, much more.
You certainly earned this. Take it with my thanks. I believe it must have been fate that brought the two of us together. Goodbye.
By all means. I would have paid any amount to be rid of those watching eyes, always watching me ... but never again! Ha ha ha! I'm FREE!!
Just as I suspected!! They've gotten to you too! Not one of them involved in the conspiracy, and you expect me to believe that?!
Now I know for sure that they are all in on it. And therefore they all have to die. Starting with you!!
Well then... I suppose I must believe you. At least now I can be sure... [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.
That is a relief... I was sure... but you have proved yourself... trustworthy. A friend indeed!
And so it all falls into place... yes, yes, it all makes sense now. [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.
So he really is innocent, then. Interesting ... perhaps they have been using him as a decoy, to draw my attention away from their real spies ...
Really?! So you're saying that neither Bernadette Peneles or Toutius Sextius is part of the conspiracy against me? Hard to believe.
So I was right all along! You're doing excellent work, my friend.
Then why do you waste my time!?  Do as you agreed, and meet me here tomorrow night!
Really? That is surprising. I was SURE she was watching me.
Just as I thought, just as I thought. Excellent work. There will be a bonus in this for you, don't worry.
Oh, well... I, I understand. The danger is too great. You're right, you should stay out of this. I'll just have to solve this myself.
Very good, you won't be sorry.  I'll pay you well, did I say that already?
Let's start with Bernadette Peneles.  Be outside my house at 6 am, you'll see her watching me.  See where she goes and who she reports to.
We'll meet here again tomorrow night.  Oh, and NEVER contact me in public.  They're watching.  They can't know you're helping me.
Let me give you some advice. Glarthir is crazy. So far harmless crazy, but I keep an eye on him because it's my job to.
You don't want to get involved with him. I don't care how much he's paying you, it isn't worth it. Like I said, he's crazy.
Since you were courteous enough to tell me the truth, I'll do the same by trusting you to talk to a guard if he asks you to do anything... strange.
Fine. Play it that way. Let me give you some friendly advice. Glarthir is crazy. Maybe harmless crazy, maybe not.
Don't get involved with him. If he asks you to do anything... strange... you come see me first, got it? Or any of the town Guard. Let us handle it.
It is my business.  Allow me to introduce myself: Captain Dion of the Count's Guard, at your service.
Now, you were telling me why you're interested in Glarthir.
I always suspected she was watching me. Thank you for finally confirming it.
I still can hardly believe she wasn't watching me. But it is a relief to be able to finally stop worrying about her.
Her house is almost directly across the street from mine, southwest of the Great Chapel. Coincidence? I don't think so.
Ours is not the only Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. There are others, hidden throughout Cyrodiil, each one overseen by a Speaker of the Black Hand.
I've heard the Count of Cheydinhal knows about this Sanctuary. But he is offered much gold, as well as other... incentives, to keep his mouth shut.
This Sanctuary has been here since before even I joined the Dark Brotherhood, and that was two-hundred years ago.
Have you ever lived on the streets, struggled to survive? This Sanctuary is my home. Here I have the safety and love I've searched for all my life.
You know what they say -- home is where you hang your enemy's head.
In truth, I miss the towering elms of my native Valenwood. But I was banished from there, for deeds I don't care to discuss. This is my home now.
I should only say this once. I will go away when you hit goodbye.
OK, let's test the random text. You should get this about half the time.
You should get this about 1/4 the time.
You should get this about 1/4 the time, too. The best way to test this is the click about 10 times and just jot down on notebook what you get.
If you get this, my disp to you should be 70 or higher. use Angry and Happy to raise and lower my disp.
If you get this, my disp is between 70 and 30. You should get info refusal for any lower. use Angry and Happy to raise and lower my disp.
OK. Pick one of the choices. The topics should've disappeared and you should only have two choices to pick from.
My Disp to you is now over 70.
A pity, but not unexpected. We shall speak again.
Then seek Agata, child. She will see the path, and set you on it. I must rest.
He's a fairy tale. The Imperial Watch pretends there is a thief king named the Gray Fox who controls all the thieves in Cyrodiil.
I don't blame you. He's a menace to society. Let me know if you find out anything.
I think I trust you enough to tell you this secret.
To learn more about the Gray Fox, go to the Garden of Dareloth at midnight. Look in the Waterfront District of the Imperial City. I can say no more.
A friendly word of warning before you choose.
Once you have decided which Duke to replace, there's no turning back. One choice. No more, no less. Try not to do something stupid.
So, which is it? What will it be? Mania? Dementia? The suspense is killing me. Or you, if I have to keep waiting.
Syl or Thadon? Which will it be?
I hate indecision! Or maybe I don't. Make up your mind, or I'll have your skin made into a hat -- one of those arrowcatchers. I love those hats!
I'd be happy to forge Amber armor for you, but you don't have enough Amber. Consult the information I have posted.
What do you require?
I'd love to hammer Madness Armor to hold your shape. But you must provide some Madness Ore. Inspect the information I have posted.
What is your wish?
What do you desire?
I'm not sure. Only the Emperors truly understand the meaning behind the rituals of coronation.
The Amulet of Kings is ancient. Saint Alessia herself received it from the gods. It is a holy relic of great power.
When an Emperor is crowned, he uses the Amulet to light the Dragonfires at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.
With the Emperor dead and no new heir crowned, the Dragonfires in the Temple will be dark, for the first time in centuries.
It may be that the Dragonfires protected us from a threat that only the Emperor was aware of.
His name is Martin. He is a priest in the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch. Yes, Kvatch.
I cannot believe that the attack on Kvatch is a coincidence. The enemy seem to know all our secrets.
You must return to Kvatch at once, and rescue Martin if he lives. There is no time to lose!
If there's anything you need, please ask. My resources here are limited, but I will help in any way I can.
His name is Martin. He serves Akatosh in the Chapel in the city of Kvatch, south of here.
You must go to Kvatch and find him at once. If the enemy is aware of his existence, as seems likely, he is in terrible danger.
And please, let me know if there's anything you need. My resources here are limited, but I will help in any way I can.
I am one of the few who know of his existence. Many years ago, I served as captain of Uriel's bodyguards, the Blades.
One night Uriel called me in to his private chambers. A baby boy lay sleeping in a basket. Uriel told me to deliver him somewhere safe.
He never told me anything else about the baby, but I knew it was his son. From time to time he would ask about the child's progress.
Now, it seems that this illegitimate son is the heir to the Septim Throne. If he yet lives.
As unlikely as your story sounds, I believe you. Only the strange destiny of Uriel Septim could have brought you to me carrying the Amulet of Kings.
Then we can at last rest. I feared had he somehow bested you, I'd be next.  It is fortunate that your skills exceeded his.
I've come to some decisions. I intend to donate all of the money I have made, as well as what is left of these stolen items to the temple.
I also want you to know that I had a long discussion with Jensine, and I have decided to join the Society.
I realize you risked your life to give me a chance, and Thoronir never forgets things like that. Accept this ring as a humble reward.
It's the least I can do to say thank you. Now, don't be a stranger! The Copious Coinpurse is still in business.
I don't think you have the proof we need to lock this crime down and point the blame at Agarmir. You better go back and check.
You must hurry. We cannot let him do this horrible task any longer.
I'll stay here to guard the Emperor's body, and make sure no one follows you. You'd better get moving. May Talos guide you.
By the way, thanks for recovering my comrades' swords. I'll see that they are given a place of honor in the halls of the Blades.
By the way, thanks for recovering Captain Renault's sword. I'll see that it is given a place of honor in the halls of the Blades.
By the way, thanks for recovering Glenroy's sword. I'll see that it is given a place of honor in the halls of the Blades.
Take it easy. You'll be fine. I know this is a lot to take in all at once.
No one's more surprised than me that I'm sending an escaped prisoner off with the Amulet of Kings!
But the Emperor trusted you for a reason, and I trust the Emperor.
The Amulet of Kings must get to Jauffre at Weynon Priory. He'll know what to do with it.
Jauffre should know how to find the heir that the Emperor spoke of. The Amulet must reach Emperor Uriel's heir so a new emperor can be crowned!
What? This is unacceptable!
At no time did I ever suggest that you should actually follow through and give her the book! It cannot be left in her hands!
You will retrieve the book immediately, if you have any intention of ever receiving a recommendation from me!
This one turns her back on the hunter. Return when the fine can be paid.
Then I have no use for you. Begone until you can pay the fine.
Sweet! The hunter is restored. The pride welcomes the hunter once again.
Excellent! The guild accepts your... apology and welcomes you back into the fold.
I heard what you did. So did the guild Doyens. You've been cast out of the Thieves Guild.
Go talk to Armand or S'krivva. Pay the fine and you'll be reinstated.
The hunter has performed foul deeds upon other members of the pride. The Thieves Guild prohibits murder, assault and theft against fellow members.
The pride casts out the hunter until the fine is paid. Is the hunter prepared to pay the fine?
You have been cast out for mistreating your fellow Thieves Guild members. In order to be returned to the rolls you must make reparations.
Are you ready to pay the fine?
Good. The Emperor's trust was well-placed.
You must get the Amulet to Jauffre. Take no chances, but proceed to Weynon Priory immediately. Got it?

First you need to get out of here. Through that door must be the entrance to the sewers, past the locked gate. That's where we were heading.
It's a secret way out of the Imperial City. Or it was supposed to be secret.
Here. You'll need this key for the last door into the sewers.
Nothing I ever heard about. But Jauffre would be the one to know. He's the Grandmaster of my Order.
Although you may not think so to meet him. He lives quietly as a monk at Weynon Priory, near the city of Chorrol.
Jauffre? He said that? Why?
Strange. He saw something in you. Trusted you.
They say it's the Dragon Blood, that flows through the veins of every Septim. They see more than lesser men.
The Amulet of Kings is a sacred symbol of the Empire. Most people think of the Red Dragon Crown, but that's just jewelry.
The Amulet has power. Only a true heir of the Blood can wear it, they say.
He must have given it to you for a reason. Did he say why?
No. I'm sorry, but even if what you say is true, I won't abandon these people to their fate.
I'll go with you when we can all leave here together.
You destroyed the Oblivion Gate, they say. You gave them hope. You helped them drive the daedra back.
Yes. I'll come with you to Weynon Priory and hear what Jauffre has to say. Lead on.
An entire city destroyed to get at me? Why?
... Because I'm the emperor's son?
Yes. I'm a priest. Do you need a priest? I don't think I'll be much help to you.
I'm having trouble understanding the gods right now.
If all this is part of a divine plan, I'm not sure I want to have anything to do with it.
As you wish, your Grace.
Pinnacle Rock was given to us by our Lord Sheogorath as a sanctuary and place of restoration.
It is our home. It is where our numbers are strengthened, and where we return to the realm from the Waters of Oblivion.
What else would you ask of me?
Brellach was given to us by our Lord Sheogorath as a sanctuary and place of restoration.
They are a key part of the ceremony for restoring fallen comrades.
The ringing of the chimes is said to help call the souls back to Pinnacle Rock, guiding them to us, so they may return to our Lord's service.
The ringing of the chimes is said to help call the souls back to Brellach, guiding them to us, so they may return to our Lord's service.
The Wellspring is a cynosure, a place where the Animus of lost Mazken can return to this realm from the Waters of Oblivion.
The Darkness is a frightening place, even to us, and so our Lord has given us this beacon, a light to guide us back to Him.
The Wellspring is a cynosure, a place where the Animus of lost Aureal can return to this realm from the Waters of Oblivion.
I am Nivan Dalvilu.
Nivan has been murdered, and by one of the Ulfgar clan! Barbaric Nords! Mindless animals! They will pay for their actions.
Nivan is murdered! How could this have happened? Everyone was fond of Nivan, including the Ulfgar clan. We must find the assassin.
He is the head of our family. He works powerful magic, but his true gift is compromise. He is a wise, wise leader.
Dalvilu has been murdered, and we have been accused of the crime! Bastard elves! That they would dishonor us in this way....
The leader of the Dalvilu has been found dead. This is a sad day for all of Bleaker's Way.
He leads the Dalvilu family. He is a wise man, and a powerful wizard.
Hrol Ulfgar is dead, and his clan believes our family responsible! This is madness!
Hrol Ulfgar is dead! I cannot imagine who would want to harm him. The culprit will be found, though.
Hrol Ulfgar leads the Ulfgar clan. He is a fierce warrior and a wise leader. All the Dalvilu respect the man.
I am Hrol Ulfgar.
Hrol Ulfgar has been murdered, and the Dalvilu are responsible! They will pay for their treachery, the wretched Dunmer!
Hrol Ulfgar has been murdered. We will find the assassin, and he will pay dearly.
He leads the Ulfgar clan. He is slow to anger, but fierce with his axe. All the clan values his leadership and judgement.
Dalvilus have lived here peacefully with Ulfgars for generations. As leaders, Hrol Ulfgar and I work hard to preserve that tradition.
We Dalvilus are good neighbors to the Ulfgars, and our leaders, Hrol Ulfgar and Nivan Dalvilu, work hard to keep it that way.
Ulf the Bleaker settled here before Rayno Dalvilu and his family arrived. But the families have long lived together in peace.
Nivan Dalvilu and I lead the community, and have done so for many years. It is an excellent arrangement.
Many years ago, this town was settled by Ulf the Bleaker. Soon after, Rayno Dalvilu and his family arrived.
Hrol Ulfgar and Nivan Dalvilu lead the community, and have done so for many years.
Mephala tugs the strings of mortals for her pleasure. Are you sure you desire audience with the Webspinner?
Your decision is a wise one. You would be foolish to think that you might gain the favor of Boethia.
You are brave. Or suicidal. Approach then, and make an offering. Boethia demands a daedra's heart.
You who have returned from Boethia's realm, approach the shrine and learn your fate.
You have approached the shrine and spoken with Boethia. Enter the portal or do not.
You believe yourself worthy to approach the Shrine of Boethia? Perhaps. Or, perhaps you will be slaughtered. It is your choice.
Then leave here. Run away. Run away quickly. Come back when you are worthy.
Do you think yourself a hunter? Then approach the Shrine of Hircine. Leave our lord an offering.
Leave an offering of the pelt of a bear, or the pelt of a wolf at the shrine, and Hircine may find you worthy.
Or, perhaps you will learn what it is to be the hunted.
Lord Hircine has sent you to hunt the Unicorn? Count yourself doubly blessed.
Hircine has deigned to speak with you, and he has provided you with glorious prey. You have been greatly honored. Do not fail him.
Here, we make sacrifice to the Lord Hircine. We pray for a True Hunt. We beg to be Honored Prey.
I am quite pleased with the ogre slaves in my Bleak Mine. No issues of slavery with brute beasts. Profitable. And legal.
I don't believe I asked for your opinion on this matter. I am done speaking with you. Please leave my estate.
Good thinking. You want to keep your good looks, go talk to some nice pretty gods.
Afraid He might mess up that pretty face? Good thinking.
Orcs are always welcome. But Malacath wants a present. Like Troll fat. And only Troll fat.
Then go on and do your approaching. But Malacath wants a present. He likes Troll fat. And he likes only Troll fat.
I am Lord Drad.
He is my husband, a kind and gentle man. He has given me everything I might ever desire.
Drad's a fancy pants who lives in a pretty house with a pretty wife because he screws over folks like you and me. He makes us puke.
The source of my income, of course. I bought it for a song from a foolish Orc. My ogres mine the gold, and I reap the reward.
He works them in Bleak Mine. It's terrible. The guards beat the creatures mercilessly. That's all I can tell you. Now please, go.
I can't tell you about that. Please, just go.
Can you think of a better use for the mindless beasts? Under my eye, they do some good in this world.
Lord Malacath doesn't want the little brothers locked up, working like donkeys so men don't get their pretty pink hands all dirty. Makes Him mad.
Malacath likes Orcs... when He likes anything. So you can approach the shrine. He won't hurt you. Really. Go ahead.
You're not one of Malacath's favorite people. He likes Orcs. Too bad for you.  So you approach His shrine at your own risk.
I guess you haven't heard. We don't like the 'beautiful people'. But maybe you can persuade me you're ugly inside...
Then perhaps you should go, lest Vaermina take interest in your dreams.
To speak with Vaermina, you must offer a black soul gem to the Daedra Lord.
Here we worship Vaermina, praying for her to grant us true visions. What is your business here?
Meridia has spoken to you, and for that, you are blessed.
The spark of life is within you, and you are welcome here at Meridia's shrine. It is possible she will speak to you, under certain conditions.
Leave an offering at this shrine. Meridia demands tribute in the form of the remains of her enemies, the undead.
Then be on your way, lest you anger the Lady.
If you wish to speak to the Lady, visit her shrine at dawn or dusk.
Leave her an offering of glow dust, and perhaps she will deign to speak with you.
Very well, Your Grace.
Nowhere is truly safe against the power arrayed against us. But we must play for time, at least...
Cloud Ruler Temple, I think. The hidden fortress of the Blades, in the mountains near Bruma. A few men can hold it against an army.
We should leave at once.
So it has not all gone against us. Thank Talos for that! We gained Uriel's heir, and lost the Amulet of Kings.
Martin cannot stay here. We have driven them off, but they will be back once they learn of Martin's survival. Which they will.
I should have known they could find it. Little can remain hid from a Daedra Lord. I underestimated the enemy. It will not happen again.
What of your mission to Kvatch?
We'll go together. But I fear the worst.
I don't know. In the Chapel praying, I think. You must help us!
I don't know! I think they're right behind me! Prior Maborel is dead!
I was in the sheepfold when they attacked. I heard the Prior talking to someone.
Looked around the corner to see who it was. They looked like travellers, ordinary.
Suddenly weapons appeared in their hands and they cut the Prior down before he could move! They saw me watching and I ran.
Then leave, and forget you have ever seen this place.
Perhaps you have been summoned. Perhaps Nocturnal desires your service, and has guided you here. Approach.
I am Weebam-Na. What do you want?
He's always got some scam going with Bejeen, his partner. You might find them both at Weebum-Na's house.
Yes? I am Bejeen.
She wasn't a bad sort until she hooked up with that rascal Weebam-Na. That's where you're likely to find her... at Weebam-Na's house.
Why... why would you ask? I've never heard of it. No idea what you're talking about. And Weebam-Na doesn't know, either.
Never heard of the thing. And neither has Bejeen. You ask too many questions.
Eye of Nocturnal? Doesn't sound familiar to me.
You have been given a task. Do it.
Approach the shrine, if you dare.
You should not be in this place. What is your business here? Do you believe yourself worthy to speak to Nocturnal?
The Emperor... that's an idea that will take some getting used to.
In any case, we need the Amulet first. Maybe Jauffre will know where to start.
Of course. The Amulet of Kings. So we... I... can take it to the Temple of the One and light the Dragonfires. And stop the Oblivion invasion.
Welcome, brother. The hour is late, but the Master still has need for willing hands.
You may pass into the Shrine. Harrow will take you to the Master for your initiation into the service of Lord Dagon.
Do not tarry. The time of Preparation is almost over. The time of Cleansing is near.
Welcome, sister. The hour is late, but the Master still has need for willing hands.
Then you have come here to die.
What? I must warn you, no one leaves this place who does not bind himself to the service of Lord Dagon.
But I am sure you will reconsider. You have proven yourself worthy and dedicated to have come this far.
I ask you one last time: give me your possessions. The Master requires it of all initiates.
Very good. Follow me. I will take you to the Shrine.
Blasphemy! Never utter the name of the Dark Deceiver lightly!
Though his body is beyond Oblivion, his soul encircles us... always watching, waiting to pounce with lethal aplomb.
He is the bringer of pain and pleasure; the blade that cuts through our sins like a scythe through wheat.
Only a true Demented can appreciate what it means to render his name.
Yes, Arden-Sul. Doesn't the name simply roll wonderfully off the tongue?
He was the sovereign of thought and a regnant artist. To call him a simple craftsman would not suffice; know him as the Artificer Superior.
Words dripped like honey from his tongue and his songs were intoned with extraordinary verisimilitude.
Had we been blessed with his constant presence, the Isles would be a Maniac's paradise.
Think of me fondly when you bury this axe deep into your foe's skull.
When you hack off an arm, the blood spurts out in surges.
Mama used to say, "If sweet-talking doesn't work, try hitting him with a big stick!"
Smacking an idiot in the head a few times is the surest way to win an argument, my Mama used to say.
When you are really angry, it feels good to hack into someone with a giant blade.
With enough force, this will cleave through meat and bone.
Maybe later.
Aleron never mentioned it to me before.
Clever ruse. I wonder how many have died falling for it?
You haven't guessed it yet? There never was any Axe of Dragol. It was just a ruse to lure you out here.
I fell for the same trick. In my case, he told me if I retrieved the axe, he'd erase my debts. I was such an idiot to believe him.
You're now the prey in Kurdan's insane hunt, just like I am. And here, we'll most likely die.
Yeah. It's a battleaxe with the word "Dragol" carved into the haft. Huge. You can't miss it. I ain't gonna draw you a picture.
Fine. But you better not take too long. I want that axe, and I want it now.
Fine. I have it waitin' for you at the dock next to the magic shop. Now get outta my sight.
Then Aleron may not be coming home from his... ahhh, journey, for a very long time. Like permanently.
Whenever yer ready, and it better be soon, I'll have a boat waitin' for you to get to Fort Grief Island.
I just learned that a family heirloom, the Axe of Dragol, which one of my stupid relatives lost, is located on Fort Grief Island in Niben Bay.
My informant tells me it's hidden in the main keep at the center. Dunno what's guardin' it, but I'm sure you can handle it.
If you go there and bring it back to me, I'll tell you exactly where Aleron is.
You... you will? Oh thank you! Please be careful, I don't wish any harm to befall you either.
Yesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since.
I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again.
I knew it! I just knew he's gotten himself in hot water again. Please hurry and get him from that island.
I do miss him so. And when he gets back, I'm gonna kill him for making me worry like this!
It all started when Aleron became foolish, and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard earned money on bets.
I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City.
It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets.
As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.
Yeah, Ursanne's husband, Aleron is missing. Poor thing, I've seen her crying at the chapel. I hope someone can help her.
Time's wastin'. He's safe... for now.
Maybe I know him, maybe I don't. But since yer so interested, I know somethin' that could jar my memory.
None of yer damn business. I'd tell you if I liked you... and I don't.
Praise be!
So sayeth Lord Dagon. Praise be.
We have a new Sister who wishes to bind herself to the service of Lord Dagon.
We have a new Brother who wishes to bind himself to the service of Lord Dagon.
The Dragon Throne is empty, and we hold the Amulet of Kings!
Praise be to your Brothers and Sisters! Great shall be their reward in Paradise!
Hear now the words of Lord Dagon.
When I walk the earth again, the Faithful among you shall receive your reward: to be set above all other Mortals forever.
As for the rest: the weak shall be winnowed; the timid shall be cast down; the mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.
Your reward, Brothers and Sisters! The time of Cleansing draws nigh. I go now to Paradise. I shall return with Lord Dagon at the coming of the Dawn!
Advance, initiate.
She dares to touch the sacred Xarxes! Kill her!
He dares to touch the sacred Xarxes! Kill him!
I have written it down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck.
I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained.
You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak.
As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.
Once you are inside the palace itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there.
My scrying with Savilla's Stone has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves.
The boots of Springheel Jak will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall.
The Arrow of Extrication is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.
In the Imperial Sewers. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. I picked the pocket of Ocato himself to get it.
The Elder Scrolls are kept in the Imperial Palace behind a door that cannot be breached.  Savilla's Stone has revealed a path around this door.
You will have to travel the Old Way. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.
To unseal the entrance you must sneak into the basement of the palace and activate the Glass of Time, whatever that is.
I understand. I don't want anyone taking on this job unless they feel up to it. Return to me when you are more confident.
Capital! I have worked for eleven years planning this heist. Savilla's Stone provided the last bit of information I needed.
The Gray Fox requests a meeting. Please travel to Othrelo's house in the Imperial City Elven Gardens.
She is not well. I hope her amulet can be found soon.
Her condition remains unchanged. I appreciate you inquiring about her.
If Captain Burd and the Guard can't close that Oblivion Gate, then what? Will Bruma be destroyed just like Kvatch?
You get used to the cold. Got a good set of fur boots to keep my feet warm. Give a Nord a good thumping to keep the blood flowing, khah-khah-khah.
We are from Bruma.
The Countess sent Captain Burd to deal with that Oblivion Gate outside of town. We're all praying that they'll be all right.
Captain Burd and I make a good pair. He understands Nords and the North, while I appreciate the subtleties of southern culture and politics.
This is my first posting after Arcane University. The Countess and Burd like my work well enough.
You know what it's like. Make lots of friends, and look busy. Same as anywhere.
No need to go to the Imperial City. Bruma may look like a Skyrim town, but we've got all the comforts of the warm Nibenean south.
It's a little too rugged up here for me. Add a couple hairs to a Nord and you've got a bear.
Captain Burd wanted to attack the Oblivion Gate immediately, but I ordered him to wait for you.
But you must hurry! I'm afraid of what might happen if the daedra are able to get a foothold here.
The Captain said you've been inside one of those Oblivion Gate things. Said you knew how to destroy them. I sure hope you can help us.
I'm new here in Bruma myself. I'm from down Heartland way. Nords up here... no offense... don't work as hard as us Imperial Heartlanders.
We're trying to bring the comfort of the Chapel to the Nords here, but Bruma's Nords stick to their heathen gods and uncivilized practices.
I'm here to show Bruma's errant Nords the path to the true faith. They must put aside their heathen gods and worship the Nine.
Some see only the conflicts between northern and southern cultures, but I see the way they are stronger when woven together.
As Captain Burd says, we have to stay on the good side of the local Nords. It ain't their fault they're ignorant barbarians.
Well, sometimes I feel we're not welcome here. The Nords don't like Heartlanders very much.
Istirus and I used to be adventurers, but we've retired here. Bruma is far from civilization, but we're ready for a little peace and quiet.
I can't help myself. I'm just a sucker for well-heeled men. That Olav, for example, at the Tap and Tack. He's dreamy. And successful, too.
All I need is a roof, some bread, and blessings of the Nine. Bruma is Gods' country, and the Gods are good to me.
I'm retired from public practice. I only take students in Alchemy to support my hobbies.
Sorry. All I have is paints. Serviceable beasts, but nothing special. We Nords are no great fanciers of horse flesh, except in stews, I'm afraid.
The Countess is Heartland Nibenean, and so are most guildsmen and chapelmen, but most others are as Nordish as you'll find.
Lyra Rosentia collects Akaviri artifacts. She might have a project in mind. Her house is west of the chapel.
Nords who drink either get friendly or mean. I'm here to deal with the mean ones.
We're still in Cyrodiil here in Bruma, but just barely. We build for the cold, just like in Skyrim.
We drink because we're happy. We're Nords. It's just the thick tongue and fat head the day after that makes me unhappy.
Just like Skyrim, except for all the tight-ass Heartlanders around. All work and chapel... no wonder they're so sour.
I work hard. Folks like Skjorta and Olfand give us Nords a bad name, drinking and carrying on until all hours.
I make sure my guards treat the local Nords and their ways with respect.
Plenty of mineral desposits in the Jerall Mountains. I'm out for weeks at a time by myself, but I don't mind it.
Bruma's a funny place... half Cyrodiil and half Skyrim. I'm old Nord all the way. I keep the old songs and stories alive.
Bruma is a perfect town for a Nord man of leisure. Bracing mountain air, good food and drink, and lively Nord fellowship.
I hate it here. Came here with Edla. All these snooty Southerners. And damn guards won't let anyone have any fun.
One place is pretty much like another. Regner hates it, but Regner hates everything.
Yeah, you think Bruma's cold, try a winter in the Wrothgarians. Bruma's a day at the beach.
The Chapel has made enemies here in the past. The Nords prefer their dragon Ysmir to our Father Akatosh.
I'm sorry, but I really don't know much about the town itself.  I spend my time outdoors, walking the ridges and valleys.
I can't get over the dragon statue in the Temple ruins. Tell me again how you and Martin defeated Mehrunes Dagon!
Every time I walk past the Temple, I'll remember that terrible day and how you and Martin delivered us from destruction.
Too big for me. Loud. Dirty. Clowns, fools, brutes and thieves everywhere. I want to throw my gold away, I just dump it in Lake Rumare, save time.
Varnado and Maro Rufus? They don't get along. I don't understand it. I just make the armor, and keep it in good shape.
Argonians stick mostly to the river trade. We know boats and the water. We're not fussy about the sewers, either. Water cleans it all.
To earn gold, Argonians must come to the city. It is a strange life, shaped stones and whiteskins everywhere.
But in the water, we are the masters, and whiteskins pay well for our skills.
One must be very careful in the Imperial City. There are things... dangerous things... that cannot abide the light.
We are from the IC (not to be confused with the OC).
Before the Arcane University was founded in the second era, Crystal Tower on Summerset Isle was the source of all magical learning.
Since then, the Imperial City has been Tamriel's foremost magical research center.
I rarely leave the University, as I have all I need right here. If you need ingredients, try Ogier Georick at 'The Main Ingredient.'
I like to walk. You can walk for hours in the city. Always something to look at, someone to talk to.
If I don't have what you need, try Claudette Perrick at 'The Gilded Carafe'. That's right here in the Market District.
You want to buy or sell, the City is great. You want free? Go down the holes, kill some monsters. Sell your loot back in the city!
Also try my friend, Ogier Georick, The Main Ingredient, here in the District.
To know the right things, you have to know the right people. Ida Vlinorman, Mandil, Samuel Bantien, and Othrelos are the right people.
Irene Metrick and I spend a lot of time together, true. We're just good friends. But don't tell Elisa. She wouldn't understand.
Roderic is looking around for a business to invest in. I know he'll find something soon.
Whatever Uncle Iniel says. 'Lay off the Atius bastards,' he says, so we lay off.
If we work hard, Uncle Iniel says he'll set us up in business together, maybe a little fruit orchard, or maybe tomatoes.
I only do the training any more. None of the rigs and tricks. Rochelle and me just want the settled life nowadays.
Samuel was a bit wild as a young man. The City will do that to you. Bad company, bad influences.
Master Umbacano is a fine gentleman. Mad for old Ayleid stuff, true, but he's got the dosh, so it's all right, ain't it?
I got no beds here. You need a bed in the Imperial City, you got four choices. The King and Queens and Luther Broads are in the Gardens.
The Tiber Septim Hotel is very nice, but very expensive. There's the Bloated Float at the Waterfront. Sleep on a boat. And cheap, too.
It is so kind of you to favor me with your attention. Please excuse me if I seem unappreciative of the honor.
... Was I insufficiently clear? I beg your pardon. You do not interest me. We will not be having further social discourse.
Akatosh speaks to us all, but we never listen. Go to the Temple of the One. Read the Covenants. Praise the Nine!
It's not safe, talking to strangers. I don't know what's going on, but I have to be careful.
Soon, the Elder Council must choose a new emperor, and then I suppose they'll sort out my commission. Until then, I just have to keep on working.
It's not that I'm lazy. I'm just not very ambitious. You can live comfortably in the city very cheaply. So why work yourself to death?
We store goods here until the buyer can collect them, or until the ships come in.
Other arcane trainers in the City? Just one. Dovyn Aren. In the Market District. Basic instructor in Alteration.
Look. It's big, see. REALLY big. Only way to learn it is to walk it. Look at everything, talk to everyone.
I was in the Thieves Guild. But I'm out now. I retired. Too old for that foolishness. I don't keep up contacts. You get out? You stay out.
The Watch can't touch me. I'm careful, private-like. Don't like people following me. Sure, it makes people nervous, seeing me sneak around. Too bad.
It is a beautiful city. I love to walk, talk with everyone, hear the news, share the little stories of the day.
I don't miss Morrowind. All that sour Tribunal grumbling and old-fashioned ancestor worship. Good riddance.
Morrowind is still living in the Second Era. I can't believe how they treat Khajiit and Argonians. Here, we are Imperial citizens, nothing less.
I don't know. Just take a walk around. Buy something. Plenty of stores. Why'd you come in the first place?
People in the city, they get stuff and forget to pay. So I help 'em remember. You talk to 'em, lean on 'em a bit, and they remember right away.
I signed on for the Raven Rock colony. Went there as a builder. Hung around afterwards, but the money ran out.
Anyone can wear clothes. But the RIGHT clothes? That is not so easy. Go to any castle. They wear Palonirya's designs, or they're nobody.
No one can experience the City for you. You must go, walk, touch, see, feel, talk to everyone.
The Tiber Septim Hotel is clean, comfortable, and quite exclusive. I don't mind paying a little extra for a little privacy.
My favorite thing is fresh slaughterfish, caught fresh from the docks on the Waterfront.
It is well known in the City that I collect Ayleid antiquities. It's true, but I desire only very specific items.
I'm not in the habit of answering questions for strangers. No offense intended.
I'm sorry, but my studies keep me indoors for the most part. I know little of the rest of the city.
The daedra did a lot of damage, but we'll rebuild. Before you know it, the city will be as good as new.
Better, maybe, now that we've got the Dragon to watch over us.
It is a wonderful city, and I'm proud to have served her for 40 years. But I'm ready to retire, let the young folks take over the reins.
Never compromise. Never blink. Never wink at injustice. Never quit trying to make this a better city for everyone.
I aim to keep an eye on things here in the city. Take it slow, get to know the people. Try not to get off on the wrong foot.
When the city is quiet, everybody is happy. Right? If you like noise, maybe you're in the wrong place.
You know, of course, the Imperial Palace is Ayleid. White Gold Tower, they called it, back in the Middle Merethic, when the Aldmeri ruled Tamriel.
How quaint. You seek to educate yourself. At the expense of my precious time. Go. Shoo. Bother someone else.
I like cities, and this is the biggest and the best. All races, cultures, cuisines, crafts... the City has them all.
While you're in the Market District, see  Rohssan's weapons at A Fighting Chance, and see Varnado and Maro Rufus at The Best Defense for armor.
It's a beautiful city. But stay away from the Waterfront. It's not dangerous, but it's dirty, and the beggars are a nuisance.
The Black Horse Courier is run by three Khajiit brothers. They buy freelance stories with an Imperial stipend, and give the papers away for free.
It would be perfect... if the Watch could just get rid of the damn Thieves Guild. You don't have this problem in Anvil or Bruma.
Well, if you MUST have Heavy Armor, see Varnado. So heavy, so ugly... but it's your choice.
You have complaints against merchants here? You file complaints with me. I fill out lots of forms, which go to a lot of people who ignore them.
So what else did you expect? Justice? Go to the Chapel. Talk to Zenithar. He'll take care of everything.
A wealthy gentleman in the Talos Plaza district named Umbacano collects Ayleid artifacts. Perhaps he has use for someone like you.
Where can you find a bed in the City? I hear the Tiber Septim Hotel in Talos Plaza is very nice.
In the Elven Gardens, Luther Broad's Boarding House may suit less discriminating customers.
Fighters Guild has no accommodations in town. Mages Guild members have their own quarters at the Arcane University.
I can't recommend the Bloated Float on the Waterfront. The Waterfront is not a very desirable location.
The Sintavs have always been one of the leading families in the City. We will refrain from contact with the Atius, unless provoked.
What Iniel says, goes. He says, lay off the Atius, I lay off the Atius. Simple.
Things have been very quiet with the Atius. That suits me just fine. All this fighting is stupid. What are they fighting about? Just stupid pride.
Daedric shrines nearby? I know of two. North of the city, south of Bruma, east of the Silver Road, is a Mephala shrine.
East of the city, at the head of the Red River, is a shrine to Vaermina.
It's just a sport. Chapel climbing. The Watch doesn't like it, but you don't climb chapels while the Watch is standing around.
This city life is killing me. Work all day long. Drop dead, and they toss you in Lake Rumare. Just need to make my money at the Arena and live easy.
I like the ladies. It's been my weakness. But now I've got Romana, I stay away from the fleshpots.
It is SO hard to find a man you can trust in this big city. Sure, Tertius has had his share of girls. Just look at him. But all that's changed now.
The Watch is so completely on my ass. So I got to lay low for a while. I got some dosh stashed, so I'm fine for now.
I'm a Sintav, and we Sintavs stick together. Uncle Iniel got us swell jobs and a house. It's a family thing.
I'm sick of all this fighting with the Atius clan. I'm glad Uncle Iniel put his foot down.
The Sintav clan is very close. We watch out for each other, and Uncle Iniel, he knows everything, and takes care of us.
A short stay in our lovely Imperial Prison should cool your enthusiasm for a life of crime. The drunk tank in particular has a unique aroma.
Where can you find some fun? That depends on your idea of fun. You can bet, fight, or both at the Arena.
There are plenty of sights to see, and plenty of places to shop, but the Watch frowns on brawling and adventuring in the city.
I agree with the Watch Captain. This Atius-Sintav feud has gone on long enough. I can control my people. I hope Iniel can control his.
It wasn't my fault. Cyronin Sintav started it. But I'm the one who got caught, so I'm the one who has to cool his heels.
If I don't find something soon, I'm going to have to try my luck at adventuring. My pals say there's a lot of caves and ruins west towards Skingrad.
I spent 40 years at the Arcane University. Good years, but I don't miss it. Now I'm completely useless, and proud of it.
It's the city of Tiber Septim, youngest of the gods. Go to the Palace and the Temple of the One. Stand on the stones where Talos stood.
I'm fed up with the senseless feuding, blood spilled for no good reason. Glad the Watch put a stop to it.
The Earl is perhaps not well known in the city. He is a private man, and keeps to himself.
St. Alessia has blessed our city and all its people. Visit the Temple of the One, and renew your faith.
Mara's blessing on you, and on all her children. Speak to her at the Temple of the One. Ask Mother Mara; she will shower your heart with love.
Big city. I really LOVE the lights at night, shoo-shoo. The City of Love. Got it? Love? Light? Night? Big. Big, big, big, BIG!
Look around. Count the true believers. How many of these people really have faith? It's easy to have faith when everything's fine.
I'm here in the city for access to the Temple libraries, and for the bookstores... especially the First Edition in the Market District.
I find things to do. I manage the house, make sure Amantius doesn't starve or run out of ink.
It's so sad. Salomon was to compose a symphony for Uriel Septim, to be performed for the whole city in the Arena.
The Temple District is by far the most desirable address in the city. Why? Because I live here, of course. Don't you agree?
My housemates and I were lucky to find this house in the Temple District. It costs a little more, but it's a very good address.
It is a very fashionable address, of course, but we live simply.
I made quite a lot of gold from my last expedition. I bought this house, invested the rest, and now I'm just living the life of the city gentleman.
The lighthouse is mostly for show. You'd have to be an idiot to try to navigate here by night.
I've worked on the docks as long as Vlanarus, but he thinks he's the expert. He's always looking over my shoulder, do it this way, do it that way.
Kastav says he works. Ha! Flies land on him, he's too lazy to brush them off. I'm sick of taking abuse for him, even if he is my brother.
I do my part on the docks, just like Bronsila and Vlanarus. Why should I kill myself? They don't pay me any more. For what I get paid, I work plenty.
We stable horses for folks in the Imperial City. We'd sell horses, too. Except... we can't seem to keep track of them.
Sure. Some folks here think horses are for riding. Then again, some of us are Orcs. Snak gra-Bura, she prefers eating stew to riding horses.
The Black Horse Courier brings the news of the people to the people. We are funded by the Empire, so our broadsheets are always free!
You see Khajiit always running through the City? You see Ra'Jiradh and his brothers! We bring the Black Horse Courier to the good citizens, yes?
We operate throughout the Imperial City and Cyrodiil. Very fast, very accurate. News happens? The Black Horse Courier is there!
Ra'jhan used to share a house, but not now. Ra'jhan is very proud, work so hard, now has house all his own.
S'rathad learns the city by walking, talking, seeing it all. S'rathad thinks this is the best way for you, too.
The Arboretum. That's where J'mhad likes to go. Always quiet, always green.
Everyone comes to the Big City to buy and sell. Why not? More stores, better selection, better prices.
I supply many fine city merchants with goods. All sorts of things. Whatever I can buy cheap and sell dear.
I'm here because I'm a loafer. And the city's an easy place for a loafer to get by. I do odd jobs, a little adventuring, build up a little pile....
Where else? You have to be here. This is THE City. The BIG City. Why waste time in little places?
You just have to know the right people. Look up Ida Vlinorman and Othrelos in the Elven Gardens. They're the right people.
We rarely get real trouble here. The Watch puts a stop to rough stuff damn quick. I'm mostly ornamental at the Bloated Float. Makes folks happy.
You'll find a lot of orcs serving as private guards. Watch work is too dull. Lots of folks say, 'Oooh, there's an orc, she's scary'. Makes it easy.
I'm quite behind on current events, I'm afraid. I can't be of any help to you.
The Bloated Float rents beds. Only place on the waterfront. Cheap. And it's safe.
Hard to find an Orc girl in this city like Umog gra-Marad. Smart, tough, got a good trade. Nice-looking, too. So I got to make my intentions clear.
The Chestnut Handy Stables used to sell horses. But they're gone. Our horses. All gone. Big mystery. No idea where they went. [burp]
What? There's a city out there? You don't say. What good is it, eh? Dirt. Horses. Idiots. Be my guest.
Enchanting city. A real eye-full. Just walk and gawk. Stroll along the Greenway and around the Palace.
This is the only book store in the city. There's also Renoit's Books in Chorrol, Mach-Na's in Cheydinhal, and Southern Books in Leyawiin.
You want Light Armor? Pah! Why wear fluffy flutter, when you can wear real armor? But if you MUST have Light Armor, talk to Maro Rufus. Idiot.
You got to be careful. You don't want people taking notice. Just keep quiet, keep your head down.
I'm content here. Some day I hope to meet the right man, but not a seaman. Never.
There are many people in the city who interest me, and you are not one of them.
Where to sleep? The Tiber Septim Hotel in Talos Plaza is nice but expensive. Luther Broad's Boarding House in Elven Gardens is just okay.
The Bloated Float on the Waterfront is cheap... and a bit too interesting for my tastes.
The Nine say each of us is special, but that's just a lie. I don't mind, but it just sounds stupid.
You're very curious. Perhaps too curious for your own good.
A little tip. People who ask a lot of questions around here tend to be not very popular.
You have to watch out for pickpockets in the city. You'd be surprised how many waterfronters earn a good income that way.
I share my good fortunes with the poor and needy. And you ain't neither. Life isn't easy on the waterfront. But we look out for each other.
I helped build Raven Rock. Had a bad run-in with the law, so here I am. Pretty soon I'll head out for the Imperial Reserve, try my luck there.
The orrery here is the only one in Cyrodiil. There's one more in Hammerfell... the old one at Stros M'Kai.
My advice is take your time, walk around the Market District, see what's on offer. Don't buy until you've seen it all. Take your time.
I have the best prices in town? Why? I'm smart, and you're smart. We know the right people, we get the best deals.
Crime in the City? You hear a lot of complaining, but it's really not so bad. The Thieves Guild is smart; they don't want any trouble with the Watch.
It pays to know about locks and lockpicks. It's just a hobby, of course, but the average citizen feels more secure when he understands his own locks.
Thamriel says she hears voices. All the men and women who lived and died here for thousands of years... maybe they left ghosts behind.
I beg your pardon. The city? Here's the city. All around us. A thousand stones, a thousand souls.
I hear them all. Sometimes. But not right now. They're all quiet. Did you frighten them away?
It's terrible. I just can't walk past a bookstore. The First Edition, in the Market District, is the worst.
I think I'll do just fine. I'm a natural. Finder's keepers, right? And I'm a pretty good finder.
Lots of us on the Waterfront are down. We can't do that dungeon stuff like you adventurers. We got no money, and no skills. Nobody wants us.
I'll get mine. Folks in this city got plenty of gold. Take from the rich and give to the poor, if you catch my drift.
Then Aleron's death has been avenged. I told him that the gambling would lead to this, that foolish man. But he never listened.
Before you go, I have this for you. Aleron told me that if he ever got in trouble, this could be used to bail him out of jail.
He'll... not be needing it any longer, and I want you to have it. I'll not take no for an answer.
I know you did all you could, and for that, I thank you. Now, please... go in peace. I wish to be alone.
When I saw the grave look on your face, I knew something had happened to him. And what of that fetcher, Kurdan?
Don't bother. The door to this place is now locked. The only way to get out is by decending into the Hunter's Run and killing the Hunters.
One of them will have the key to the door. That's Kurdan's rules. It's the only way we can win.
I wish I could help more, but I can't fight. I've never held a weapon before in my life. Please... get us out of here!
I'm not a rich man, but if we get out of here alive, I'll do what I can to reward you.
Kurdan doesn't make most of his money being a simple usurer. He also invented what he calls the Hunter's Run.
People pay him a great deal of money to hunt and kill living human prey. No questions asked, and he takes care of the bodies.
He uses the dungeons under Fort Grief as the hunting grounds. I was placed here because he knew someone would go looking for me.
I'm sorry you got mixed up in all of this. I hope you can fight. It's our only chance of escaping alive.
Everyone is waiting to see if Farwil and his knights return from inside that dreadful Oblivion Gate. Such brave lads!
Imperials hate Dark Elves; Dark Elves hate Imperials. Imperials hate that a no-name Hlaalu trader got made into a count.
Andel Indarys doesn't help his case by having a prat for a son, and a wife that dies in very suspicious circumstances.
Our Dark Elves left Morrowind to get away from the Church and State, and they don't like it when Imperials get all holy and patriotic with them.
Of course, local Dark Elves tend to be money-grubbing, alcoholic low-brows with little education or culture.
Since I read a lot, and speak well, and don't drink brandy from milk pails, I guess I qualify as an Imperial.
But on the whole, I like Cheydinhal's Dark Elves better than I like the Imperials, so go figure....
It's all right. The Guild here, that is. That's what you meant, right? It's fine. I'm doing fine here.
We are from Cheydinhal.
Count Indarys has ordered us to hold our positions until Farwil returns from inside that accursed Oblivion Gate.
The whole town is on edge with that Oblivion Gate open just outside the walls.
I can only hope that Farwil and his knights manage to close that Oblivion Gate. The fate of Cheydinhal hangs in the balance!
I could tell you our blacks are the fastest, toughest, most reliable horses in Cyrodiil.
Tovas knows his horses, and I'll stay with him and these beautiful creatures. Forever.
Here you have your Chapel-going Imperials, and your Chapel-dodging Dark Elves, and never shall the twain meet.
The Imperials have the gold, houses, and top spots. Dark Elves like me left Morrowind and the whole priest-ridden Tribunal nightmare...
... and we take the whole patriotic 'Imperial Mission' attitude with a dose of salt.
Just look around. Is not Cheydinhal the model of civic rule? No... don't bow! I am just a humble servant of the people.
You worship the Nine Divines, perhaps? Have they ever helped or harmed you? Of course not.
Now, worship a Daedra Lord, and you get effects... bad ones, of course, but clear and measurable effects.
He pays peanuts. And thinks it entitles him to chew us out 18 hours a day? Sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake coming here.
Lots of us Dark Elves came to Cyrodiil to get away from the Temple. We're sick of living under the thumb of the priests, and scraping by on the dole.
I'm happy to be of service in any way I can, in any place I can. There are so many who need help, and so few to offer it.
It's a scandal that the Mages Guild has tolerated practice of the Black Arts among its members for so long.
The current Arch-Mage, Hannibal Traven, is true and bold to prohibit necromancy, reversing the Guild's shameful past policies of official tolerance.
I worked the Arena in the Imperial City for a while. Got up to Gladiator, then took a powder. A guy could get hurt, you know.
I am the chapter head of the Cheydinhal Mages Guild. It is quite an honor... but they had no choice, since I'm the only semi-competent one here.
I'm very fond of Cheydinhal. It's where I met my love, Eilonwy. Our lives are quite long, and choosing the right partner is very important.
Perhaps it seems silly, but our love is the most important thing in all creation. Orintur and I spend all our time together, in the High Elf way.
You're not on my list. And that's all I have to say. If you were somebody, I'd know. But I don't, so you aren't.
The Count, Andel Indarys, is a Hlaalu parvenu, but his steward, Naspia Cosma, does her best to coach him on the finer points of Imperial etiquette.
Our most celebrated citizen is Rythe Lythandas, the famous painter. Speak to his wife, and she might let you take a peek into his studio.
Did you know we have the finest horses in Cyrodiil, right here in town? Black Waterside Stables... the best thoroughbred blacks.
I closely supervise the priests and healers of Cheydinhal Chapel, so they might more closely approach the sacred ideals of our faith.
To be frank, I'd prefer a career in the Arena to this paper-pusher's position.
Ra'qanar is your friend, no? Your servant? Whatever you require? Ra'qanar knows nothing... less, even. But Ra'qanar wishes to please.
I came here because I love nature. And because I didn't want to serve as a boot wizard in a mountain legion in Skyrim.
I've settled down here. Nice place. A little slow, but it suits me. Burz gro-Khash is a bear sometimes, but I got thick skin. Doesn't bother me.
Business is bad with that damn Oblivion Gate outside of town. You think things can't get any worse, and then they do.
I'm retired from adventuring... but you might try the old mine they call 'Rickety Mine' out east along the Blue Road.
Another possibility in that direction might be Kemen. It's an old Ayleid ruin.
You might also look at Quickwater Cave to the north. I cleared it out, but I haven't been there in years. It might have new tenants.
Treasure holes near Cheydinhal?  Not close by.
Fort Naso and Fort Facian, though... bad news. Undead, and then some. But far out and foul enough, you'll get plenty of action.
The Guild is going to hell in a hogcart. Look at what they give me? Keld of the Isles? Ohtimbar? Both Guardian rank? Phah! Useless.
Look. A fly. Buzz, buzz. Hey. Look everybody! I'm talking to a fly! Buzz, buzz, buzz!
You stupid or something? What are you doing here? Go back where you came from. We don't like your kind here.
Voranil got parties near about every night, and there's plenty of cooking and cleaning and preparing to be done. If you don't mind.
It's a grand house, Riverside, and they have grand parties there. All the rich swongs and swells of the town come in. Leave a right mess, they do.
What are you asking me for? Do I look like Vile's dog or something? Go on. Knit a doily or play a flute or something.
Boss uglies in Cheydinhal are the Orums. Don't mean nothing to you. You is the Outside. Just stay Outside, and everything's Mister Tinker. Got me?
My progress through the ranks here will be slow. My prejudices against certain types of magic limit my chances for advancement.
Well, to be honest, I don't think we have much of a team in the Cheydinhal guildhall. We lack leadership, and individually, we aren't very skilled.
You got your people, and you got your dogs. Dogs are loyal and stupid. People are smart and devious. I'll stick with dogs.
We're all wondering when more of those evil Gates are going to open. I'd leave town if I dared.
Didn't you see that Oblivion Gate just outside the walls? Mara preserve us from the fate of Kvatch!
I came to Bravil because Mara called me. Bravil is not my home. I miss Black Marsh. But I shall serve here, so long as Mara needs me.
I take my duties as chapter head very seriously... unlike SOME guild mages. It infuriates me how casual some guild heads are about common civility.
Ha! Members of the Thieves Guild in our fair town? What makes you think that? Never! Absurd! Such fine law-abiding citizens are we all!
What? You have not eyes to see? The castle, of course! The only challenge worthy of a swift sneaker.
We are from Bravil.
You MUST have a fast horse! Travel quickly to ruined forts and caves nearby! It will pay for itself in precious time saved!
The Count was once a tournament champion. Now he's a loafer and skirt-chaser. And his son, Gellius, is a spoiled good-for-nothing skooma-sucker.
Uravasa and Marz leave me little to do here in Bravil. That leaves me free to devote my time to Mara's ministry throughout the Empire.
I love my work. Fire, frost, shock, poison... little presents for Kynareth's cute little woodland creatures.
Other Bravil trainers? City-Swimmer teaches Sneak. Dro'shanji teaches Security. Varon Vamori teaches Speechcraft.
Me? I got no problem with Bravil. Lovely town. That little prince, the count's boy, he's sweet with the sugar. EEEA-sy Street, all the way.
Mara guides and protects Bravil, like she protects any good family. Like any good family, we have our problems.
Far be it from me to criticize my patron and sovereign. Bravil obviously flourishes under his wise and beneficent rule.
The Renrijra Krin are Khajiit bandits and smugglers posing as guerillas and freedom fighters.
There's a lot of adventuring action from here south to Blackwood, and everyone comes to me with their gear.
Old, worn, and wicked. Wet, wounded, and wild. Empty as the eastern horizon, dusk on the Niben. Solemn and bitter as the grave.
My neighbor, Dro'shanji, is worried. He's seen creatures around the house lately. Why don't you talk to Dro'shanji, see if you can help?
Have you looked around? Bravil is Tamriel's cloaca. Silverhome is the only decent place in town. Don't know why I stay here.
There are two ruined forts south of Bravil. One is close to the road to Leyawiin. The other is out on a point of land that projects into Niben Bay.
I'm afraid I'm not very social. So I really don't know very much about the people here.
Bravil? Good points? Cheap to live. Unpretentious. Free-wheeling. Bad points? Culturally, a hole. Count's a clown and his son's a skooma-sucker.
The Ayelid ruin of Anutwyll is nearby. I can spend a few days on site, then return here for the comforts of home and my library.
Excuse me. I stay to myself. I have always found the wrong sort of friends. Now I do without.
I won't risk my Guard attacking that infernal Oblivion Gate. We'll hold the walls and hope for the best.
The Count put the Guard on high alert. We'll be ready if the daedra decide to attack, don't worry.
Yes, yes, Count of Bravil. Are you a foreigner? Do yourself a favor. Learn the basics about the places you visit. There. Problem solved.
Yes. Bravil. How clever of you. You've already learned the name of the town and county. I see a great future for you in public service.
The Count used to be a great man, but power and idleness have spoilt him. However, we remain loyal in memory of past kindnesses, and to serve Bravil.
Bravil is an important trade center, and a rich melting pot of Imperial, Khajiit, and Argonian cultures. And, yes, a bit shabby and shopworn.
The Count is too preoccupied with his pastimes to spend time on county affairs. So the burden lies on me.
The Fighters Guild is good enough to encourage me in sharing the inner peace and spiritual harmony of the martial arts.
Bravil is perhaps not so nice. But Bravil Castle, and castle gardens, they are jewels, are they not?
Well, perhaps, yes, one hears such things, what is one to believe? That S'krivva collects goods of untestable provenance? Pshaw. Rumors.
Bravil perhaps presents little scope for an ambitious member of our guild. Perhaps you may find the castle entertaining. Little else.
You are stupid, so I'll make myself clear... you are stupid. Go away. I don't want your blood and puke all over me.
R'vanni just wants to get along. No trouble. Anything you want. R'vanni's know-nothing, good-for-nothing. Ask anyone. Just don't hurt R'vanni.
My task is to know and love the people of Bravil as if they were my own children. If you have ever been a parent, you know what a challenge that is.
I was with the Count when he was young, and a shining star on the tournament path. I only wish he'd straighten his son out.
Been here. Right here! All day! Last night, too! I wasn't there! Not there at all! I can totally prove it! Ask anyone!
A local woman, Ursanne Loche, has a missing husband. She might appreciate some help from someone like you.
It is a terrible responsibility, being Bravil's First Citizen of the Ale Tub, but I suffer under the burden like a Sure-Green Orc.
What's a pretty young thing like me doing in this swamp town? I inherited the business from my late husband, and I aim to make it work.
I have nothing to say about the Count and his son. The rest of the town is a little rough. But I don't mind. I like it that way.
Do you really think I could afford to let you leave here? The key you found is a fake. No prey has ever left this island alive.
And I aim to keep it that way. You were right about one thing though...
This IS my game, and I'm changin' the rules!
Suit yourself. I'm sure it isn't anything important.
Ah, it's coming back to me now. Yeah, seems I saw someone looking out the window at Jearl's house the other day.
Someone I'd never seen before. When Jearl wasn't home. You see what I mean?
Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has given me a powerful thirst. Thankee kindly.
She's just back from a trip south, they say. Haven't seen hide nor hair of her myself though. Stays indoors all day long, I guess.
Not that I can think of. People are mostly staying home, what with all the troubles in the world.
Not that it's anybody's business, but I have noticed voices coming from Jearl's house. But I've never seen anybody but Jearl go in or out. Strange.
Not on my watch. Captain Burd will know for sure, though. We all report to him.
Well, since I like you ... I think there's somebody staying with Jearl.
Never seen 'em, but I've heard her talking to someone, and I've seen somebody at the window when Jearl wasn't home.
None of my business, but since you asked ...
Nothing comes to mind. Of course, my memory sometimes ain't what it used to be.
Really? That is odd. I know for certain that she returned alone. I don't like it.
Since you're working with Cloud Ruler Temple, I'm going to authorize you to search Jearl's house. I'll pass the word to my men. We won't interfere.
Excellent work. I knew I could count on you. The gods did not idly choose you as their agent, whatever you may think.
But we have not eliminated the threat against Bruma and Cloud Ruler Temple, only delayed it. I will warn the Countess of the danger.
You should speak to Martin. I believe he has made some progress with the Mysterium Xarxes.
This makes for grim reading. The Mythic Dawn did not take long to locate Martin again.
The document speaks of two agents. You need to eliminate both of them.
But it is clear that Mankar Camoran will soon bring all his power to bear against Bruma. I will warn the Countess of the danger.
Good. But there may still be more spies out there. You should continue to search for their base of operations in Bruma.
Very well. Keep looking. We must uncover those spies and find out what they know.
You must eliminate both the Mythic Dawn agents in Bruma. We cannot allow them to continue to plot against us.
Thank you. Talk to Steffan. He can tell you where he has seen them.
Captain Burd in Bruma may also be able to help. I've asked the Countess to have the guard keep an eye out for strangers.
Track down the spies and kill them. Find out what they know, and what they're plannning, if possible.
Ah, yes. I hope you can help. The gate guards have reported seeing strangers on the road for the past several nights.
I cannot leave Cloud Ruler undefended while my men search the whole mountainside, but these spies must be eliminated.
We always see them near the runestone at dusk. They aren't too woodcrafty, but Grandmaster Jauffre has forbidden us to range too far from the walls.
But it seems that you have been given the freedom to attack the enemy that we all crave! Good luck. We will keep the Emperor safe here, don't worry.
Except for Jearl coming back from a trip down south, things are pretty quiet. Not much travel right now with the Oblivion Crisis.
I've told my men to keep a sharp eye out, but I've had no reports of any strangers in town.
What about you? Turned up anything suspicious?
Nothing new to report on my end. Have you uncovered anything suspicious?
I trust that you'll handle things ... appropriately. The less I know about it, the better.
I do. I did. And I won't say it again. But, that's enough about that. You're the ruler of Dementia! Just look at you. You're positively beaming!
You now have the power to summon Dark Seducers. They've always served the Duke of Dementia. I think they have a thing for pain.
And here is the Ring of Lordship, a symbol of your new station. Symbols are important. They carry weight in this Realm, and others.
You would be well served to remember that.
No! Let him go!
Then go, Thadon. Have your Greenmote. Take a bath. But leave. Before I decorate my throne with your insides.
Change will preserve us! It is the lifeblood of the Isles. It will move mountains! It will mount movements!
Fool? Visionary! Change is in the air, Thadon. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later.
Calm yourself, Thadon. You're making my teeth itch. You still hold your office. I suggest you see to your duties.
Hold your tongue, little Duke, or I'll tear it from your mouth.
Enough! I go to Jyggalag. I give myself to him, as a Priest of Order! This isn't done, Madgod. I think it's just started.
Yes. That's it. I'll go. Away. Far away. Working for them is like working for us, but without all the dying.
No. No. Certainly not. This isn't good. I'm sure it's bad. I can't do this anymore. No more.
Order approaches! It's taken the Fringe already! With Order clothes and Order hats! And you speak of "change"?
Ridiculous! You can't do this! Although... you're omnipotent. Or just tall. It's one of the two, I'm sure. And a fool!
But, this... stranger? Someone new? From somewhere else? Not here. I'm sure of that. I don't understand. Or I can't.
Syl... my... Syl is dead? This can't be right. Is this right? What have you done? Have you done this?
Lucien isn't here very often. His duties with the Black Hand keep him very busy, so he trusts me to keep the Sanctuary in order.
Ocheeva and I have known Lucien since we were hatchlings. He is the one who trained us in the way of the Shadowscale, and is like a father to us.
You should take some time to admire his corpse. It really is a thing of beauty. The punctures and slashes are almost... poetic.
When I first joined the family, this Sanctuary was controlled by another Speaker. Lucien took over when she was killed while fulfilling a contract.
I will always think of Lucien Lachance as my savior. When he found me, I was living in a gutter, an inch away from death. I owe him everything.
The four of us attacking him in unison was as graceful and beautiful as a ballet! The flashing of steel, the spraying of blood!
When we confronted Lachance he tried to defend himself, tried to declare his innocence! But we would not hear his treacherous lies!
As you can see, he was no match for the combined power of the Black Hand, even weakened as we are.
I... I don't even know what to say. How could we have been so wrong? Lucien tried to explain, but we wouldn't listen...
But he is certainly in a better place now. Lucien Lachance's soul now serves Sithis in the Void. It is an honor he earned, and deserves.
Most of my time is now spent on administrative duties. I have not had blood on my hands in far too long! Killing Lachance was pure ecstacy.
I once saw Lucien deal with an insubordinate Brother, someone who had broken the Tenets. It took me a week to get the blood off my boots.
Actually, Lucien did not try to recruit me. Not at first. He tried to kill me. My father wanted me dead, and he hired the Dark Brotherhood to do it.
I escaped from Lucien, and paid my father back for his treachery. Lucien came to me again that night with an offer I just couldn't refuse.
The Dark Brotherhood is not in the business of staging deaths, no matter how much gold is offered. Sithis demands blood, and blood must be paid.
In order to accept the contract, we demanded a life. Motierre offered his mother, and we accepted. Lucien has already taken care of that... detail.
I suggest you deliver that book as soon as possible. Your recommendation depends on it.
No? Are you quite sure? I would hate to think that you do, in fact, have the book, and simply have no intention of turning it over.
Very well. Should you happen to find it, it would be in the best interest of all for it to be secure here within the guild hall.
I see. Perhaps it's just as well. The book is best left in secret.
If you were to know of its whereabouts, I trust that you would bring it to me immediately.
Then why are we speaking? We have nothing to discuss unless you bring me that book. Now go away.
Finally. I shall see to it that the book is kept safe until the Council decides what should be done with it.
I shall also overlook your... transgression, and send a recommendation to the Arcane University.
Is this an attempt at humor? If so, I am not amused. Produce that book immediately.
Ah, yes. This is indeed the correct book. You've not been able to open it, I presume? Then all is well.
You have shown yourself worthy of the guild, and for that I thank you. You shall have the recommendation you need.
Now, I must ensure this book is kept safe. Excuse me.
You have helped ensure that this book will remain safe from those who would misuse it. You have the Guild's thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me...
This is not a matter for levity. If you have truly found the book, I expect you to bring it here once you have possession of it.
Ah, wonderful! I'll just take this from you, and get to work translating it. I'll need some time with this; come and find me tomorrow.
I'll be here until I've finished my work. But please don't disturb me until I'm done; this is quite a delicate business, you see.
I'll be at the Grey Mare until I've finished my work. But please don't disturb me until I'm done; this is quite a delicate business, you see.
Either you're lying to me, or your feeble little mind has forgotten that you put it down someplace. I'm not amused. Go get the book.
Hrmph. Very well. Good day.
Excellent. It's a simple task, really - all you need to do is fetch a book for me.
The book is entitled "Fingers of the Mountain" -- it is of no use to you; you won't be able to read it. I, however, can, and would very much like to.
You'll find it at an old ruin called Cloud Top. It's north of Chorrol, up in the mountains. I'm afraid I don't have an exact location.
Return it to me immediately when you have it. Make no mention of it to Teekeeus or anyone else in your guild. I will make it well worth your effort.
Once you've got the book, return it to me immediately. I assure you, it will be worth your time.
Is the book safe? Do you have it?
Have you recovered the book yet?
Curious that you should inquire about it, as it has recently gone missing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
I have the book stored safely for now; I shall hold on to it until the Council decides what should be done with it.
The book is in safe hands for now; that is all you need to know.
The book is safe. That is all you need to know.
Do you have the book this time?
You've found the book? My trust in you was well-placed, it seems. Hand it over, if you please.
Should you go looking for it, I hope that it would be for the sole purpose of bringing it here.
What? Not only does it exist, but she knows where it is? Well, this is unacceptable. That book needs to be in the safe-keeping of the Guild.
I trust that as a member of the Guild, you would do the right thing and acquire this text before Earana does.
Are we clear? Ignore her request, go to this place she has described, and return with the book. This is far more important than any petty squabble.
So Earana has ascertained the location of the book, has she? This is an unfortunate turn of events. She can't be trusted with it.
I would hope that any responsible citizen, if given the chance, would acquire the book and deliver it here, so that it may be properly looked after.
That book requires a great deal of care and security. I hope I am making myself clear.
Doesn't that have something to do with the Ayleids, and magical control over the weather? I think that's the rumor I heard.
Do you have it THIS time? Or did you decide to give it to another of my sworn enemies?
I believe I've made myself more than clear. I want that book, and I expect you to clean up this little mess you've made.
As I've said, the only notes I've taken, I have given to you. The rest is only of interest to me, I assure you.
Oh, and do be careful with what I've given you. It's very valuable, but... well, slightly dangerous. You'll see what I mean.
I need more time to work on the translation. The more you bother me, the longer it's going to take.
It's a very old text, written in a language I'm sure you wouldn't understand. Don't worry about it -- just bring me the book.
Well, look at that! You should take that to Teekeeus right away - he'll want to see it.
I still don't believe it's real. If it was real, you'd have some sort of proof, right? Well, I don't see any proof.
I've heard rumors, but they're nothing more than that. Imperials trying to harness the power of the Ayleids... they're not fools.
If Teekeeus says it's a myth, I have no reason to believe otherwise. Can you prove him wrong?
I've heard of it, but I don't really know what it is. Something about tapping into the power of the weather. Those Ayleids were pretty crazy.
That's a real shame. With just a little help, I think we would have a chance. But I can't risk leaving the camp defenseless.
The longer we wait, the smaller our window of opportunity. Get ready, and do it quickly. We've got to move soon.
Then I suggest you head back to the safety of the encampment. I have no more time to talk.
That's what the Empire has come to. I doubt any of the other cities will be sending us aid either. Every man for himself these days.
I don't know how to close this Gate, but it must be possible, because the enemy closed the ones they opened during the initial attack.
You can see the marks on the ground where they were, with the Great Gate right in the middle.
I sent men into the Gate, to see if they could find a way to shut it. They haven't come back.
If you can get in there, find out what happened to them. If they're alive, help them finish the job. If not, see what you can do on your own.
The best I can say is, good luck. If you make it back alive, we'll be waiting for you.
You'll find him at the barricade at the top of the road. He's still trying to hold what's left of the Guard together.
We'll have to break the news to him that Antus didn't make it. He fought bravely, and father will respect that.
I have the highest respect for my father... I just wish he could have seen us cross blades with the enemy.
He is not coming with us? I think I understand, and it is better that he remain safe. Though I wonder why he has asked you to take his place.
You would join us, though you have no personal stake in this fight? An honorable deed... I gladly accept your help, then.
There's no point in waiting here any longer. Follow me!
If my father is not at home, he should be in the Grey Mare. He is supposed to come with us.
Father will be so proud of us... but I wish he'd been here.
What do you mean he's not coming? He told YOU to come with us instead? Has he no honor?
He's the best fighter you'll ever meet, and as soon as he gets here, we'll be off. Just wait; you'll see.
Aye, we've heard the old man's story. Nothing to back it up, though, except the word of those two kids of his. No real evidence.
Even if it was true, it's out in the forest somewhere. We need to keep what's inside the town walls safe, not go running around outside them.
Foul things, they deserve the death you've brought them.
Please, hurry so you can accompany my sons. They're probably waiting at Weynon Priory by now.
Rallus knows why we have to be the ones to get rid of them. Antus... he's another story.
He's a good boy, but he's hot-headed. Keep a close eye on him, will you?
For the last few days, we've suffered attacks from these creatures at our farm not far from Chorrol.
They're coming from someplace in the Great Forest. I don't know where, but Rallus may know more by now.
My boys will take up the fight even if the guards won't. Doesn't matter if it's outside the town walls - it still affects us all.
They expect me to go with them, but...  I fear in my old age, I'm not the warrior I once was. Would you... would you go in my place?
Ha! I knew they couldn't stand up to us!
I think I'm ready for this, but I worry about Antus. He's never seen a fight like this before.
They began raiding our farm a few days ago. There are more now, and I have no idea where they're coming from.
It's our duty to protect our own, even if others will do nothing. Father taught us that much, and we won't back down from a fight.
The guards claim there's no evidence of them, so they won't lift a finger. That's why we have to be the ones to deal with them.
Know that Rufio is old and weak, and sleeps his days away. You could kill him before he even has a chance to wake. If you so choose.
Rufio lies dead. Well done. The family will now welcome you with open arms.
Rufio? He was killed! Murdered! Right here in my inn! And I thought business was bad before. When this gets out, I'll never rent another room!
Rufio? He's an old codger. Been living here for a couple weeks now. If you ask me, he's hiding from something. But what do I care? He pays his tab.
His room is downstairs, in what I like to call the Private Quarters. Use that hatch in the floor over there. But don't expect a warm reception.
Rufio is dead. He was murdered. It looks like he was hiding out from somebody after all.
Not a lot to tell. He doesn't much like company, and spends most of his time in his room. Manheim thinks he's hiding out from someone.
It's a horrible name for an inn, I know. But I just can't bring myself to change it. Besides, I like the sign.
The only people that stay here are stragglers on the Green Road. Me, I got no place else to be. Besides, I think Manheim is sweet on me.
Pity. I'm eager to see how you fare on your first assignment. Well, the contract will still be here when you're ready.
Excellent. Here is what you must do. Go to the Waterfront District of the Imperial City. There you will find a ship named the Marie Elena.
Board the ship and find its captain, Gaston Tussaud. He'll be in his cabin. Eliminate Tussaud in any manner you see fit.
The pirates have been moving a lot of cargo onboard lately. You may be able to smuggle yourself onboard in one of the packing crates.
Oh, and one more thing. Get into the habit of asking your fellow family members about any current contract. Their insight may prove invaluable.
There's a scholar at the Arcane University. Tar-Meena's her name. Supposed to be an expert on daedric cults.
Why don't you take that book to her, see what she makes of it. I'll keep running down leads on the Mythic Dawn network.
If you learn anything, you can find me at Luther Broad's. May Talos guide you.
The assassins who killed the Emperor were part of a daedric cult known as the Mythic Dawn.
Apparently worship the Daedra Lord Mehrunes Dagon. I've been tracking their agents in the Imperial City. I guess they noticed.
Good. Remember, wait for him to follow me. I want to see what he'll do.
We can't talk now! Just follow my lead.
So you said. That's very bad news.
What? They took it from Jauffre? Things are worse than I had thought.
Don't talk. Just follow my lead.
I hoped I had heard you correctly. Thank Talos! The Blades will protect Martin until he can claim his throne, don't worry. Or we will die trying.
Thank Talos he lives! Martin Septim, you say ... We will restore him to the throne! It is the sworn duty of all Blades.
What do you mean? I'm an upstanding citizen! I have nothing to hide!
I won't be bullied! I'm not some pathetic book-worm you can just push around! I have friends, you know!
The Mythic Dawn? Are you... I mean, I don't know what you're talking about! I don't know anything about any cult.
Are you... threatening me? You can't scare me! I'll call the guards if you don't leave at once!
It isn't for sale. You'll have to find a copy somewhere else.
Thank you, thank you! I can't tell you how long I've been looking for this book!
You can be sure I won't be back! I've never been treated so shabbily in all my life! Good day, sir!
Ah, of course. Here you go. Keep us in mind for any future needs!
Ah, about that. You see ... I don't have it any more. Terribly sorry. A full refund, of course...
I wish I had one, but I've never even seen a copy.
As you wish. That's a very fair price. I guarantee you won't find volume three of Mankar Camoran's Commentaries anywhere else, for any price.
I hope you'll keep us in mind for all your specialty book needs!
Very well. I hate to deny a dedicated... scholar... like yourself. I'll sell it to you, if you must have it.
I had a copy of Volume Three, but Gwinas has already picked it up. So sorry.
I had a copy of Volume Three, but I am sorry to say that it was stolen recently. The thieves in the Market District get more brazen by the day!
Gwinas will be terribly disappointed when he learns it is gone.
I had a copy of Volume Three, but I am sorry to say that it was stolen recently. Gwinas was terribly upset when he found out, poor fellow.
I sold you my only copy of Volume Three. Gwinas will be terribly disappointed when he learns it is gone.
I hope you're enjoying the copy I sold you. Gwinas was terribly upset when he found out, poor fellow.
I'd like to help you, but the cost... I would have to try to obtain another copy for Gwinas, not to mention his disappointment if he found out ...
I'm afraid I couldn't sell it to you for any price. I've already promised it to someone else, and my word is my bond.
I'm sorry, do I know you? I have a copy waiting for me at a bookstore, but it is not for sale. I've waited a long time to get that book.
Have you been following me? Leave me alone! That book is mine!
I don't want to talk about it. I'm still very angry at Phintias. He promised me he would get one for me. I came all the way from Valenwood for it!
I told you, I'm done with those books. I'm sorry I ever got mixed up with those maniacs!
Well, just this once I don't suppose it would do any harm. Gwinas mentioned he was staying at the Tiber Septim Hotel.
Perhaps he'd be willing to sell you Volume 3. But I doubt it. He was very pleased with his purchase.
He was very upset when he found out I didn't have his book for him. I doubt he'll be in any mood to talk to you about it.
I've already said too much. I'm sure you understand. My customers expect absolute discretion.
I don't know him personally. But he was very eager to get his hands on Volume 3 of Camoran's "Commentaries." Came all the way from Valenwood!
As a matter of fact, he's already late for his appointment to pick up the book.
Feel free to wait for him if you want to speak to him yourself.
I happen to have a copy of Volume Three on hand, but I'm afraid it is a ... special order. Already paid for by another customer. Sorry.
Gwinas would be terribly disappointed if it was gone when he came to pick it up. So sorry I can't help you.
Here, you can have the library's copy of Volume 2. Treat it gently, if you please!
As I said, I've never even seen the third and fourth volumes. You should try First Edition, over in the Market District.
Phintias, the proprietor, caters to specialist collectors. He may have an idea of where to locate those books.
Find them, eh? I won't poke my nose any further. Official business and all that. I'm used to working with the Blades, don't worry. Say no more.
In any case, finding them won't be easy. I've studied Mankar Camoran's writings a bit myself, at least those that I could find.
It is clear from the text that Mankar Camoran's "Commentaries" come in four volumes, but I've only ever seen the first two books.
I believe that his writings contain hidden clues to the location of the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine to Mehrunes Dagon.
Those who unlock this hidden path have proven themselves worthy to join the ranks of the Mythic Dawn cult. Finding the shrine is the first test.
If you want to find them, you'll need all four volumes of the "Commentaries."
Ah yes. "Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes," wonderful! You have a scholarly interest in daedric cults, then?
Yes, I see that now. I regret that Traven has involved you in this way. At least you've survived... for now.
Perhaps in the future, you can be trusted enough to deal with more serious matters.
Now, our business here is concluded. I suggest you return to your Council.
Would you dare make demands of me now?
And a book, of all things. Your gullibility knows no bounds, it would seem.
You believe your Council would send you here to merely fetch a book? No, they wanted information on me and what is going on here.
Well, now they shall have it.
Is that so? Perhaps your Council has not been entirely honest with you.
Do you really believe they sent you here for a book? No, they sent you to spy on me.
They've heard the same rumors I have about the Necromancers' Cult.
Tell your Council that the next time they want something from me, they come themselves. They don't send someone under false pretenses.
Despite what your Council may think, I've not thrown in with the Necromancers, and would never do so. You may pass along that message.
Do you not recognize a Necromancer when you see one?
I suspected Mercator was involved in their cult, but was unwilling to move against him without knowing the identities of his allies.
Count Janus Hassildor, at your service. A 'thank you' might be in order at this point.
This just might be the break we've been looking for! Good work.
We need to get that fourth book, then. If Tar-Meena is right, we can use these books to locate the Mythic Dawn's hidden shrine.
Let's go. I know that part of the sewers well.
Now heed these words. The slaying of Rufio was the signing of a covenant. The manner of execution, your signature. Rufio's blood, the ink.
As a Speaker of the Black Hand, I directly oversee a particular group of family members. You will join that group, and fulfill any contracts given.
You must now go to the city of Cheydinhal, to the abandoned house near the eastern wall. Enter the basement, and attempt to open the black door.
You will be asked a question. Answer thusly: "Sanguine, my Brother." You will gain entrance to the Sanctuary. Once inside, speak with Ocheeva.
We must now take our leave of each other, you and I, for there is much work to be done. I'll be following... your progress. Welcome to the family.
Now you embrace your fate. For the slaying of Rufio was the signing of a covenant. The manner of execution, your signature. Rufio's blood, the ink.
Indeed. For the slaying of Rufio was the signing of a covenant. The manner of execution, your signature. Rufio's blood, the ink.
Please accept this token from the Dark Brotherhood. It is a virgin blade, and thirsts for blood. May it serve you well, as does your silence.
Now, I bid you farewell. I do hope we'll meet again soon.
No? The Night Mother seems to think otherwise. Allow me to grant you a gift, in case you reconsider. It is a virgin blade, and thirsts for blood.
Excellent! Now please, accept this token from the Dark Brotherhood. It is a virgin blade, and thirsts for blood. May it serve your endeavors well.
So, I have your rapt attention. Splendid. Now listen closely. On the Green Road to the north of Bravil lies the Inn of Ill Omen.
There you will find a man named Rufio. Kill him, and your initiation into the Dark Brotherhood will be complete.
Do this, and the next time you sleep in a location I deem secure, I will reveal myself once more, bearing the love of your new family.
Then heed my words, for I will not repeat them. On the Green Road to the north of Bravil lies the Inn of Ill Omen.
Ah, I find your etiquette refreshing. Now please, listen carefully. On the Green Road to the north of Bravil lies the Inn of Ill Omen.
You prefer silence, then? As do I, my dear child. As do I. For is silence not the symphony of death, the orchestration of Sithis himself?
Ironic, then, that I come to you now as Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood. My name is Lucien Lachance, and my voice is the will of the Night Mother.
She's been watching you. Observing as you kill, admiring as you end life without pity or remorse. The Night Mother is most pleased...
That is why I stand here before you. I bear an offering. An opportunity... to join our rather unique family...
In due time, dear child. In due time. First, an introduction. I am Lucien Lachance, Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood.
And you, you are a cold-blooded killer, capable of taking life without mercy or remorse. The Night Mother has been watching, and she is most pleased.
And so, here I am. I come to you with an offering. An opportunity... to join our rather unique family.
I am Lucien Lachance, a Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood. And you, you are a killer. A taker of life. A harvester of souls.
Your work, your deathcraft, pleases the Night Mother. And so, I come to you with an offering. An opportunity... to join our rather unique family.
We simply wanted to survey the situation in Skingrad. Our relationship with Hassildor is tenuous at best.
The Council has agreed to keep his nature a secret, and in exchange he occasionally provides us with useful information.
As a vampire, the Count has few allies he can trust.
He has disguised his nature from most, but cannot hide it from the Council of Mages. So, he approached us with an accord.
As you have seen, that agreement is under a great deal of strain lately. The Count does not agree with certain policies the guild has established.
It's not quite that simple. Hassildor is powerful, to be sure, but the Council does not consider him to be a threat.
After all, he has ruled over Skingrad for quite some time without incident.
Arch-Mage Traven feared that sending a high-ranking official with the guild might draw too much attention, and provoke a reaction from the Count.
We were also concerned that it might drive any Necromancers in the area underground, making them more difficult to root out.
The Count's unique nature is not public knowledge. The Council wishes to keep it that way.
At the time, it was believed there was no reason to inform you, since it was not crucial to the task you were given.
For that reason, I was unable to disclose more about his true identity to you. Clearly that judgment was in error. I apologize.
Gods! It's the Count! Run!
We feared Hassildor may have been involved with the Necromancers. Thanks to your involvement, it would seem that he is not.
At least, not for the moment. We will continue to monitor the situation, but I assure you we will make no further attempts to mislead you.
You have done your job admirably, and I thank you for it.
So. You want to become one of the Chosen of Mehrunes Dagon.
The Path of Dawn is difficult. But the rewards are great.
I have the book you seek. With it and the Master's three other books, you will possess the key to enlightenment.
But do you have the wit and strength to use the key that you have been given? If so, I will see you next at Dagon's Shrine.
Yes, I think you may...
Wait! I've seen you before! You're the Blade that Brother Astav was tailing!
Take a seat.
Sit down. Now. My patience is not unlimited.
I'm afraid you have failed the first test. There are no second chances in Lord Dagon's service.
I told you to come alone! Brothers, kill them!!
Brothers, kill this pretender!
Very well. We'll do it your way. Be careful, and remember, we can't leave here without that book. It's our best chance of getting the Amulet back.
Well, don't take too long. I don't think they'll like it if they realize you didn't come alone.
Good. Remember, we must not leave here without the book. It's our best chance of finding the Amulet.
No, it should be me. I have a blood debt to repay these Mythic Dawn assassins. Besides, I've trained for this kind of thing my whole life.
The sewers run underneath the whole Imperial City. There are access points in every district.
The Blades have occasion to use them in our undercover work, as well as a means to move around the city without attracting attention.
This is the big one. This is the heist that will be written about and talked about for decades to come.
We are going to steal one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Palace. Are you ready for this challenge?
Ah! Still thinking about your reward, eh? I have not forgotten you or your loyal service to the Thieves Guild. You'll just have to trust me.
Give this ring to Countess Umbranox in Anvil. Say nothing about me to her. I need to know how she reacts to it. It may provoke anger or tears.
If she asks, just tell her a stranger wanted her to have it. Then report back to me on her reaction.
There is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll.
As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money. Will you do it?
I think I saw a copy last time I was at The First Edition Bookshop in the Market District.
Yes, indeed. Legend has it that Garridan found the Ewer, and that it was guarded by a fearsome creature. It is also said that the creature froze him.
When Garridan realized his quest was a failure, and he wouldn't be able to return and save the farmers, he began to shed some tears.
As the ice enveloped him, some of his tears were frozen as well. Some even say that the Divine, Mara, took pity on the poor knight.
To commemerate his kind heart, she imbued the Tears with some sort of magical power. That's only rumor though.
You know, if you're really interested in more, there's a book I read once called "Knightfall." It may have more about Garridan.
Certainly. Garridan was a knight who lorded over a small village of peaceful farmers. One harvest summer, there was a horrible drought.
The farmers appealed to Garridan to discover a solution. He spent a week consulting with sages, until one of them mentioned a possibility.
The sage told him of an artifact called the Everflow Ewer. The vessel, which looked like a silver pitcher, was said to supply endless water.
You actually found them? Interesting. I'll have to make a note of that.
I wish I could tell you more about them, but that's all I remember from speaking to my colleagues here at the University.
You aren't the first person to go looking for those. Quite a remarkable story, really. I know a bit about it.
Sorry, can't help you with that.
They're the pride of my collection.
You found five of the Tears? Fantastic! This turned out better than I expected. Perhaps a little bit of a bonus is in order.
There isn't much else I can do to equip you for this journey. Only to wish you luck.
Well, if what you learned is accurate, then you must protect yourself. It sounds like the cold in the glade is so severe that it could harm you.
Perhaps these potions will help.
After you read the book, I'll help in any way that I can.
Interesting. I didn't know that much history about the Tears. I suggest you go find that book Julienne mentioned. It sounds ideal.
The Tears are small crystals, bluish in appearance. Quite beautiful I'd imagine.
The Tears are not just a namesake. They're literally the frozen tears of a knight named Garridan Stalrous who lived many years ago.
I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask.
Seek out Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. She oversees the Alchemy Headquaters there.
If anyone can help you get more information about these crystals, she can.
Sorry, I can no longer help you with that.
Very well. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Straight to the point, eh? Good, I like that.
I'm searching for some specific crystals known as Garridan's Tears. If you can locate these objects for me, I'd pay handsomely for each one.
Wonderful! I had a good feeling about you from the moment that I saw you.
I want you to bring to me as many of Garridan's Tears as you can find. If you do, I will pay you a fair bounty in gold for each one.
I confess I have a weakness for crystals of a magical nature, and I must add these to my collection.
This is a personal errand, you must understand. Just between you and I. The Mages Guild has nothing to do with it.
The curse has been broken. Of course the thieves will only recognize you as their guildmaster when you wear the cowl.
However, when you remove the cowl, eveyone will know you as yourself. Fortunately, the cowl still has the power to hide your alter ego from them.
They will not realize that you are the same person that just took off the cowl. To them, the Gray Fox just vanished into thin air.
If Emer Dareloth had not stolen Nocturnal's Cowl, the Thieves Guild would never have fallen on such hard times.
Because of the curse, he was unable to operate in the normal world of business and society. He could only act as the guild's figurehead.
That has been undone. If you go to the Imperial City, you will find that the Thieves Guild has a guild hall on the site of the ruins of Dareloth.
By the power of the Elder Scrolls I name Emer Dareloth as the true thief of Nocturnal's Cowl.
My husband's wedding ring! I never thought to see it again. What I wouldn't give to see him once more.
This ring belonged to my husband! He has been missing for over 10 years. For some reason, his name and face escape me at the moment.
How did you get it? Do you know his whereabouts? Why are you showing it to me?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said. Whatever it is you want, it will have to wait until I am holding audience in the Great Hall.
If you cannot perform a simple function for the guild, you are clearly undeserving of membership in it.
Then you shall remain suspended from the guild. If this is your attitude, perhaps we are all better off for it.
Very well. Make no mistake: this task is simple, but has a purpose.
In selflessly serving the guild, at risk to yourself, while putting your own feelings aside, you prove your devotion to the cause.
You will help replenish alchemical supplies for the guild. Bring me 20 Vampire Dust and 20 Daedra Hearts.
Surprised? Annoyed? It is not unexpected. Nevertheless, that is your path to re-acceptance in the guild.
You will help replenish alchemical supplies for the guild. Deliver 20 Dragon's Tongue flowers, and 20 Redwort Flowers to me.
Very well. Bring me 20 Vampire Dust and 20 Daedra Hearts, and your guild privileges shall be restored.
I can only hope that putting your life at risk for the guild will put things in perspective for you, and help you to value the privileges it offers.
Very well. Bring me 20 Dragon's Tongues and 20 Redwort flowers, and your guild privileges shall be restored.
Perhaps, while you spend time collecting these ingredients, you can consider the ramifications of your actions.
Sorry, that's all I had. The refining process is quite costly, and very tedious.
Yes. I have them for sale. If you'd like to buy some, feel free. They're top quality... I refined them myself.
Yes. I've heard of mages who seal portals with an ingredient as a key. Makes the door impossible to lockpick.
Refined frost salts sounds like something that Julienne would specialize in. You may want to go back to the University and speak to her.
In the Argonian homeland of Black Marsh, those born under the sign of the Shadow are taken at birth and presented to the Dark Brotherhood.
A Shadowscale hatchling is trained in the arts of stealth and assassination, and lives a life in service to the mighty kingdom of Argonia.
Any Shadowscale who lives to come of age is accepted into the Dark Brotherhood as a full member of the family. So it was with myself, and Ocheeva.
I see you have been speaking with Teinaava. What he says is true. All our lives we have lived together in the shadows. We are egg mates. Twins.
We were taken at birth, and given to the Dark Brotherhood. We returned to Black Marsh as Shadowscales, trained in the arts of stealth and murder.
Together we served our nation as spies and assassins, as all Shadowscales do. When we came of age we joined the family as one. And here we are.
Those fools in the Church and their so-called "Nine Divines." There is no divinity beyond the eternal and terrible rule of our Dread Father, Sithis.
Who is Sithis, you ask? Some call him the Dread Father. It was his terrible love that gave birth to the Dark Brotherhood, so very long ago.
S...  Sithis? Well... I am just a lowly Murderer, but... But I know Sithis is our Dread Father. When we kill, we send him souls! Is that right?
Sithis is the darkness of time immemorial. He is no Daedra, and dwells not in the realm of Oblivion. No, Sithis is something altogether... different.
Sometimes, right before a kill, Sithis speaks to me. He whispers in my ear and fills my heart with the joy of suffering and death!
Sithis has blessed us with you, dear Listener. He is our Dread Father, and his wisdom and terrible fury know no bounds.
How does one best describe our Dread Father? Imagine a perfect, cloudless midnight, cold as winter ice and shrouded in shadow. That is Sithis.
Truthfully? I've never really understood who or what Sithis really is. As long as I obey the Tenets and fulfill my contracts, I guess he's happy.
Long ago, in an age now forgotten, Sithis came to the Night Mother and begat her five sons. So you see, his love gave birth to the Dark Brotherhood.
To employ the services of the Dark Brotherhood, one must perform a ritual to the Night Mother. Only then will she heed their prayers for murder.
It is an ancient rite, this Black Sacrament. All across the Empire, every day, people beseech the Night Mother to take the lives of others.
After a person performs the ritual, they are contacted by a Speaker. Gold is exchanged, and the details worked out. So it has always been.
The Night Mother is the Dark Brotherhood's Unholy Matron. She guides our actions, just as the Dread Father Sithis once guided hers.
You... you're asking me about the Night Mother? Well, I... I mean... she is our Unholy Matron! She... she speaks... to you!
The Night Mother speaks to only one member of the Dark Brotherhood -- the Listener of the Black Hand. And when Our Lady speaks, death follows.
I've always wondered who the Night Mother really is. Some say she's an old woman who lives somewhere here in Cyrodiil, but I'm not so sure.
The Night Mother must be awakened, so that we may seek her guidance. Are you ready to travel now to her resting place?
You must understand our need for darkness and secrecy? Speak to me only between the hours of midnight and 3:00 AM, and we will be off.
As the new Listener of the Black Hand, it is your task to speak with the statue of the Night Mother, and hear the words of our Unholy Matron.
The statue, as you know, is located in the city of Bravil. You may speak with the Night Mother once a week, and then pass that information on to me.
Do that, and you will receive your share of this Sanctuary's weekly earnings.
We praise our Unholy Matron. From her shadowed womb we were born, from her breast we suckle malice and pain. She loves her children, you see.
I don't know who the Night Mother is, but she pays me to kill people. My own mother should have loved me so much.
Our Lady is surely an ancient and powerful elf. Someday, when I am Listener of the Black Hand, I will look upon her beautiful and unholy form!
Julianos preserve us! I can't believe it ... why me?! Please, show this to the guards right away!
So he has finally snapped! I knew we should have warned the guards back when I noticed him trying to break into my house ...
This has gone far enough. It's past time I dealt with this madman once and for all.
Damn! He's finally gone completely bonkers! Thanks for the tip. Now stand aside and let the Guard do their work.
What?! This is ... unbelievable! Of all the strange fates, to become the target of a stranger's madness ...
Please, you must show this to the guards at once. My life is in your hands!
Why? What's he done?
Really? He's getting worse, then. Thanks for letting me know. If you think he's becoming dangerous, you come straight to me and I'll handle it.
Dead, you say? Well, then... you may as well finish what you started. [Scribbles something on a piece of paper.] Here. This is your last task.
Dead, you say? ... you mean you ... did it really have to come to that? Well, if that was the only solution ... I suppose I should thank you.
What? Dead?! ... you mean you... did it really have to come to that? Well, if that was the only solution... I suppose I should thank you.
Really? She's really dead?! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm free, I'm finally FREE!
Really? He's really dead?! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm free, I'm finally FREE!
You won't help me? You're abandoning me now, just when I need you the most?!
No... no. I understand. It is my problem, and I should solve it myself. You're right. I should never have involved you. Good night.
Really? They're really dead?! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm free, I'm finally FREE!
I knew he was the ringleader of the whole conspiracy! You may have helped save my life!
The Surilie house is right next door to mine. A large house with a backyard conveniently located to observe my every move.
Cloud Ruler Temple was built long ago, by the founders of the Blades, back in the days of Reman Cyrodiil.
It is high in the mountains near Bruma... our ancient fortress, sanctuary, refuge of last resort. Martin will be as safe there as anywhere.
This place was built by Reman Cyrodiil's Akaviri Dragonguard, at the founding of the Second Empire.
Since then, it has served the Blades as a headquarters, fortress, and sanctuary. We can protect Martin here until you recover the Amulet of Kings.
This old place is the one thing that gives me some sense of certainty in these uncertain times.
There's no place more secure in all of Cyrodiil. I just wish... I wish we could have gotten our Lord Uriel here....
I'd have to say I'm partial to the Great Hall. On those cold nights, nothing warms your bones better than a roaring fire.
Sometimes, when it's quiet, I walk the battlements and breathe in the cold mountain air. It's the only peace I allow myself.
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she? It's hard not to admire the stonework. That's some real craftsmanship, that is.
Cloud Ruler is many things. Temple, fortress, safe haven. But it's also my home. I'll gladly die defending these walls, if it comes to it.
Don't worry, we'll keep the Emperor Martin safe here. No enemy has ever taken Cloud Ruler from the Blades.
I haven't been to Cloud Ruler since I was a young trainee. It feels good to be back. The Blades have always been here, and always will be.
As you wish. Just remember, had I issued a direct order, you would not have been able to refuse. So say the Tenets. Consider what I have said.
You must go to the city of Chorrol and break into the house of Francois Motierre. Inside you will find Motierre waiting for you. Do not kill him!
You see, Francois Motierre is a marked man. He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people. So, they have sent an enforcer to kill him.
Here. You will use this specially poisoned knife to stage Motierre's death, in the enforcer's presence. Motierre himself will provide more details.
This is an unusual contract. Motierre had to make a special arrangement with us before it was approved. I trust in your professionalism.
Well, that's just my opinion.
Emfrid? She owns the Grey Mare, right? Huh. I go to the Oak and Crosier.
I'm a captain, you see, and the Oak and Crosier serves... a better class of people...
Listen to me. I sure sound like a snob. Snooty, in fact, and not very nice.
Thanks. That's a very good suggestion. I think I'll stop by the Grey Mare, and perhaps pay my respects to this Emfrid woman.
It's uncertain exactly what illness Roderick has contracted. But don't worry, it's probably not contagious. He he he he he.
Actually, I gave you this contract in the hope that whatever Roderick has is contagious, and you'll die a slow, lingering death in a matter of days.
Fort Sutch? I am familiar with that place. It is nestled deep in the mountains. It is naturally well defended, but there is a weakness.
Not far from from the ruins of Fort Sutch lie the ruins of a tower. That tower was once part of the Fort Sutch Abbey.
The two ruins lie apart on the surface. But underground, they're connected by some now-flooded tunnels. Wet and dark, yes... but surely unguarded.
Fort Sutch? It is an impregnable fortress surrounded by mountains. You'll never even get inside, let alone kill your target. Good luck.
For giving you this contract, Ocheeva is wise beyond her years. You will fail in your task, and die in the process.
The enforcer will not appreciate your little show. He'll likely attack you on sight, but you must resist the urge to fight back!
If the target is old and weak, as you say, then his manservant is sure to be quite the opposite. Best stay out of his way.
I could help you, yes. But I won't. Your failure will give me much joy.
If things go badly, forgo the plan and simply kill the mark any way you can. You'll lose the bonus, but at least the contract will be fulfilled.
For the love of Sithis, you have to kill a feeble old man. Is that too much for you to handle?
You come crying to me for help? Perhaps Lucien Lachance was wrong about you after all, eh?
The Marie Elena, you say? I've seen that ship. There's a unique balcony at the stern. My guess is it leads to the captain's cabin. Could be useful.
I killed a pirate once. Of course the ship was out to sea at the time. Somewhere between Vvardenfell and Solstheim. Now those were the days.
I serve Lucien Lachance and the Dark Brotherhood, and will guide you as directed. But you will get no additional help from me.
I know those sewers well. They will allow you access to the prison, but are home to some fearsome creatures. Tread carefully.
You will not make it past the sewers. Of this I am certain.
No Dark Brother or Sister has successfully infiltrated the Imperial Prison in over three hundred years. This will be a true test of your abilities.
I was hoping Vicente would give you this contract. When you are captured and killed, the assignment will go to someone more competent.
Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge.
I take much joy in giving you this contract. With so many targets come so many opportunities to fail. The chance of you surviving is slim at best.
Remember the pretenses under which the guests are there. They will be suspicious. You must be as effective an actor as you are a killer.
It would be a good idea to talk to each guest and appeal to their good disposition. Remember, if they really like you, they may open up to you.
You should dress appropriately. The Deceiver's Finery, your recent quest reward, would serve this purpose nicely. If you earned it, that is...
You may be a killer, but are you an actor? I think not. The guests will discover your true identity and you will never leave that house alive.
Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course, you'll be killing all the other guests. Are you ready to attend?
The High Elf Faelian lives in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks. Speak with your fellow family members. They may offer their insights.
I have given you little more than a name. I can only pray that you'll wander the Imperial City aimlessly for days, and then eventually die of hunger.
I do so love pursuing a contract in the Imperial City! The alleys, the shadows, the challenge of evading Phillida's Legion troops! I envy you!
With every unattainable contract my sister gives you, I find myself loving her more and more.
In the Imperial City there lives a High Elf who must be removed from existence. Finding this person may prove... challenging. Are you interested?
Far to the west there lives a fierce warlord and his company of loyal mercenaries. Your target is the warlord. Do you accept this contract?
Adamus Phillida will find no rest in retirement. No, his soul will endure a kind of eternal suffering known only to those who have angered Sithis.
It's not my place to question the wisdom of Lucien Lachance or the Black Hand, but trusting you with the Rose of Sithis? It is... folly.
The Rose will only work if Phillida is unarmored. So, when would a soldier not wear his armor? I only take my armor off to sleep or swim...
One of my dear friends was killed while trying to kill Phillida, several years ago. He was twice the assassin you are! Your are doomed to failure.
Do you recall the name Adamus Phillida? The Imperial Legion pest? It's time he joined Sithis in the Void. Think you're up to the task?
Lucien Lachance's word is law. Whatever contract he has given you must be carried out, without question.
So, it's a secret contract then, is it? You must be moving up in the world. Congratulations.
These mercenary groups tend to be fanatically loyal to whomever leader they follow. Roderick's people will likely fight to the death. Be cautious.
Roderick is a mercenary leader, and his people are fanatically loyal. They will cut you to ribbons if they see you. And they will see you.
Ooh, using poision is so deliciously evil! I once poisioned my aunt's stew, and she fell over dead with her face right in the bowl! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I think it says something about Ocheeva's faith in your abilities when she gives you a contract to kill someone who isn't even conscious...
The knife I gave you has been coated with a rare poison called Languorwine. You need only cut Motierre once, and he will appear to die.
It just so happens I am familiar with the Chorrol Chapel Undercroft. You're as good as dead.
I once slept in the Chorrol Chapel Undercroft. It's damp, cold... and cursed! Getting Motierre out of there may be a challenge.
You are to travel to Bruma, enter the house of the Wood Elf Baenlin, and kill him. It should look like an accident. I'm sure you can handle it.
How do you plan on entering this man's house? Through the front door? Be smart and look for a more inconspicuous way in, like a cellar entrance.
That manservant is going to squash you like a bug! I can't wait to see what's left of you.
A contract is a secret pact one enters into with the Dark Brotherhood. They provide us with gold, and we remove someone from existence.
A contract is fulfilled by a skilled assassin such as yourself, who keeps the Dark Brotherhood's end of the bargain. So it has always been.
While carrying out a contract, you may have the opportunity to earn a bonus if certain parameters are met. Now, let's begin, shall we?
I'm not sure how you feel about pirates, but you've got to kill one. A captain, in fact. On his ship. Surrounded by his crew. Interested?
Your first contract requires the killing of a pirate captain, on his ship. Are you ready to accept?
As a pirate, Gaston Tussaud has certainly spilled his share of blood. Someone wants revenge, and they've hired us to extract it.
I've traveled by prison ship. It was cramped and dark. There was little room to move around, but plenty of shadowy nooks to hide in. Remember that.
Ha! The great assassin needs help fulfilling a contract. You'll get no aid from me.
We're usually called upon to take a life, but not this time. This contract requires us to stage the assassination of a marked man. Are you ready?
We need you to stage an... accident. Kill the target in the manner specified, and you'll receive a considerable bonus. Do you accept this contract?
Ever broken out of jail? How do you feel about breaking into one? The Imperial Prison, to be exact. We need a prisoner... silenced. Can you do it?
You must infiltrate the Imperial Prison and kill Valen Dreth, a Dark Elf. He should be easy enough to eliminate, once you actually get inside.
The Imperial Prison! Long did I languish there, in my youth, before the Brotherhood found me.  The guards are strong and cruel. So very cruel....
I can only hope the prison guards do to you what they did to me. You will know the true definition of the word "horror."
The key to successfully completing this contract is effectively blending in with the other guests. So for Sithis' sake, do not wear your hood...
So, it's to be five against one, is it? The odds are against you. With any luck, you'll be dead within an hour.
Remember, you must make the other guests feel comfortable. Make them like you. Make them TRUST you. Then bathe in their blood! Hehehehe!
Why do you get to go to a party? It's not fair. I hope they discover the truth and kill you in your sleep!
The Elves of the Imperial City are a fairly close-knit community. One of them will have at least heard of Faelian. You should ask around.
I look at you and wonder how you're still alive, considering your utter incompetence as an assassin. With any luck, this contract will be your last.
Know what I'd do? Talk to Faelian, learn who he is. Maybe then you can lead him to a secluded place. Then, when you're alone... you know! He he he!
I don't know what idea appeals to me more: you getting killed by this Faelian person or the Imperial Legion using your corpse as a target dummy.
Phillida may be retired, but he'll likely have a bodyguard, probably a member of the Leyawiin City Watch. You may have to dispose of him as well.
What madness has stricken the Black Hand, that they would trust such an important task to someone so very useless?
Oh! You're being sent to kill Phillida? I hope the Rose of Sithis pierces his heart and sends his soul screaming into the Void!
You're being sent to assassinate Adamus Phillida? Oh, finally Ocheeva has come to her senses! You'll be killed, and we'll finally be rid of you!
Lachance would not have selected you for a contract unless he had the utmost confidence in your abilities. Best not let him down.
Ooh, a secret assignment, you say? Come on, can't you give your old pal Mraaj-Dar a hint? Who do you have to kill? Anyone I know? Ha ha ha ha!
What do you mean nobody can see you? Where's the fun in that? Damn the bonus, I say! Just walk in there and stab him!
Oh, this is going to be funny! You're going to be the first assassin in Dark Brotherhood history who couldn't even kill an invalid! Ha ha ha ha ha!
What a pathetic contract. Play acting and running, but no actual killing? I can see why Vicenti gave it to you... coward.
What? Fake a death? And you can't even kill the enforcer? I don't envy you, friend. But a contract's a contract. Just do what you've got to do.
The manservant's name is Gromm, you say? Sounds like a Nord. Probably a big one. If he catches you, get ready for a serious fight.
What's the matter? You can't kill an old man? Want Gogron to hold your hand? You make me sick!
So, your first contract. No chance for a bonus, huh? That's all right, you're better off! Who needs magic items when you've got raw skill?
And the great thing about killing a target up close and personal is you can talk to 'em before you do it! You know, say something scary!
For example, this one time, I had a contract to kill a little Nord girl at her birthday party. She asked me if I was the jester!
So I said to her, "No, I am a messenger of death." You should have seen the look on her face! Ha ha ha ha! Anyway, she won't be seeing age six!
What's the matter, can't handle the pressure? Or maybe you're just... weak.
Infiltrating the Imperial Prison is no small matter. Those guards are heavily armed and professionally trained. If discovered, don't be a fool. Flee!
I can only pray that you break the Tenets and surrender to the guards. I will beg Lucien for the right to kill you.
If you really plan on killing the guests one by one, make sure that when you strike, you strike hard. Don't want anyone running for help, do you?
What's the matter, five targets too much for you? If Vicente gave me that contract I'd be home before supper.
They're all dead? Well, you'll have to take over for them. Get back there and clear out that mine. Get moving!
You've already cleared that place of all the goblins? Go figure. Fine. Then I guess you don't need to deliver those weapons.
Well, you got the weapons there, but there were casualties after. Do better in the future, or don't come to me for work. Here's your reward.
You got the weapons there and cleared the mine with no casualties. Better than I expected from you. Here's your reward, and a little bonus.
I suppose I've got something for you. We need a weapons shipment delivered to Desolate Mine. That's your job.
Now this is what I'm talking about! You kill him up close, face-to-face, and you still get the bonus! I wish all the contracts were like that!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! By Sithis, you are an idiot! Ocheeva has sent you on a suicide mission! Phillida's men are going to cut you to pieces!
Hmm. Don't get me wrong, that magic arrow sounds nice and all, but it seems to me like you don't even need to use it to get the bonus.
As long as you cut off his finger and leave it in that desk, you'll get your bonus. Sounds to me like you can kill the old sod anyway you'd like.
So what if he's wearing armor! You think that Imperial Legion scrap can stop a well-forged claymore? Not bloody likely! Ha ha ha ha ha!
You're going to kill Adamus Phillida? You? Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, it'll be a retirement, all right. Yours!
It's from Biene Amelion at the Water's Edge settlement. She needs something retrieved from her ancestral tomb. Try not to muck it up.
I've got nothing else for you.
You were supposed to check out those disappearances at Harlun's Watch. What's the status?
I've got one more for you, meat. I assume you can handle it. I need you to investigate some disappearances at Harlun's Watch.
I've got more for you. Important stuff, actually. You need to go talk to Lord Rugdumph.
You need to take care of those fugitives from the prison break in Bravil.
I've got something for you. Could be tough. There are some escaped fugitives for you to find, meat.
Lachance gave me a special assignment once. Had to go all the way to Sumerset Isle for that one, killed me about thirty Elves. Ah, good times....
I understand Oreyn is looking for you again. Get to Chorrol and speak with the man.
I've been told to send you to Chorrol for some duties. Speak with Oreyn.
You've got duties to attend to. First, though, you're ready for advancement.
You're needed in Chorrol. Report to Vilena Donton. She's got some duties for you to take care of.
I've got nothing else. Don't believe Azzan does either. I think you had better go talk to our friend in Chorrol. You know who.
Nothing now. Not at your rank. Go see Azzan. In Anvil. Maybe he's got something.
A contract for you? I think I've got something that suits your experience. Arvena Thelas has some problem with rats in her house.
Good to see you're working hard. I've got some more thieves for you to deal with in Anvil.
Well done! You've put in good work for me. I only wish I had more. Things are a little lean right now, as I'm sure you know. Here's your payment.
You need to find the Stone of St. Alessia and return it to Cirroc at the Chapel of Talos in Bruma. Now, get to it.
I've only got one more thing on my plate for you, but it's an important one. The Stone of St. Alessia has been stolen from the Bruma Chapel.
She's dead? What have you done? Of all the irresponsible.... I'm very disappointed in you. You've let me down and your Guild.
You've finished? Excellent! Good work, guildmate. Here's your payment for the contract.
You left your charge in that place? Get back there!
Good to see that you're looking for more work. There's certainly more to be done. I need you to help Elante of Alinor.
Looking for more work, eh? Good. I've got a contract for you. I'd like you to go talk to Norbert Lelles, here in Anvil.
I'm hoping you'll do better with this one than your last one. That really wasn't good.
I'll need someone who's at least an Apprentice for this job. Maybe you're ready for advancement?
I've got nothing more for you, my friend. I believe Burz has one further assignment, but that is all. I wish you luck.
I've nothing else for you, and I don't believe Burz has any, either. I think perhaps you had better speak with our friend in Chorrol. Good luck.
I don't have anything for anyone of your rank. Check with Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal. He might have something.
Ah, now this is the type of contract I live for! You must become pure shadow. It's as if you were never there, and then Roderick simply... dies.
This is an outrage! This contract should have gone to me! My stealth skills are unmatched! You will never succeed! Never!
Remember, timing is everything. You need to slash Motierre with the blade in Hides-His-Heart's presence, and then flee before the enforcer can react.
Bah! You have neither the skill nor the daring to fulfill this contract. I hope the moneylender cuts out your heart.
Yes, you'll find that some jobs require you to terminate a mark in a specific way. It's well worth the trouble, considering how good the bonuses are.
This contract requires stealth and subtlety. You possess neither. When you fail, I will gladly take your place.
Pirates, eh? They tend to be quick, and good with a blade, but don't favor armor. They're not fond of bows or spells, either.
So, you come to me for assistance. How interesting. I think I'd much rather you die in the field.
This prisoner, why give him a chance to escape, or fight back? Pierce his heart with an arrow, right through the bars of the cell. Quick and easy.
Vicente wants YOU to infiltrate the Imperial Prison? I didn't realize you had such a good sense of humor.
Take your time with this one. Observe the other guests. Learn their schedules and behaviors, and strike each one when they're alone.
Use your silver tongue. Try to befriend the guests, and then you may be able to lure them to their own dooms! Hahahahahaha!
You come to me for knowledge, for advice? I would sooner see you flounder in a pool of your own blood. Good luck, worm.
I'd never suggest you forfeit a bonus, of course, but killing Faelian indoors is so unappealing. Too bad you couldn't snipe him from a balcony.
But first I guess you have to find him, right? The Elven races of the Imperial City are a community unto themselves. Ask them about Faelian.
So, you need to find this High Elf, hmm? Why don't you take a trip to Summerset Isle, ask around for him there. Idiot.
The Rose of Sithis! Such an honor! Just make sure your marksmanship is up to the task. If you miss the target, the enchantment will be wasted.
Ah, of course. You're going to succeed where three previous family members have failed. How silly of me...
We've got one. Let's hope this one will pay well.
Lachance has given you a... a secret assignment? But I've been asking for this chance for so long.... Surely he doesn't doubt my abilities!
What? You filthy little maggot! When I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!
Well then, I suggest you get your affairs in order and return to me as soon as you're able.
That's what we call folk from the eastern side of Cyrodiil. The old name of the lowland part of Cyrodiil is Nibenay.
Hmm. I thought you'd jump at the opportunity to infiltrate the most heavily fortified prison in all of Cyrodiil. Maybe I overestimated you after all.
As always, you fail to disappoint me. Your target is a Dark Elf named Valen Dreth. He thinks he's safe in prison. He is tragically mistaken.
A prisoner recently escaped from the prison, using a set of secret tunnels connecting to the Imperial City's sewer system. It's a perfect way inside.
Just outside the Imperial Prison is a grating that leads to the sewers. It has recently been tightly locked, but I will provide a key.
It should be easy enough to locate Dreth in his small cell. Besides, I think you know the way, hmmm. He he he he he.
Valen Dreth has been imprisoned for many years. His tongue is sharp, but his body is limp and frail. He will prove an easy, pleasurable kill.
You will receive a bonus if you fulfill the contract without killing any of the prison guards. Now go, and may the Night Mother go with you.
As I expected. Good. The target is a Wood Elf named Baenlin. You will find him at his home in Bruma. Enter secretly, and avoid his manservant, Gromm.
On the second floor is a secret door leading to a crawlspace. Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Baenlin's favorite chair.
Loosen those fastenings any night between 8:00pm and 11:00pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is his custom.
If Baenlin is eliminated in any other manner, or if the manservant Gromm is killed, you will forfeit the bonus. Now go, and may Sithis be with you.
Okay, we'll wait here. Just let us know when it's safe to proceed.
So... the brothers have once again reclaimed Weatherleah, eh? Good for them!
Yes, I've heard of the place, but I'm not sure where it is. I think your best bet would be to speak to Sabine Laul at the Fighters Guild.
She's explored the back country outside of Chorrol quite a bit.
Yes, yes. Our home, stolen by ogres. My head hurts something terrible right now - speak to Guilbert, will you?
You are welcome here anytime, my friend!
We can't wait to return to Weatherleah, now that the ogres are dead!
We look forward to returning to our family's ancestral home at Weatherleah, once the ogres are dead.
I wish my father had given me a better description of its location, but for some reason all he told me was "South of Chorrol, north of Fort Carmala."
Weatherleah was our family's home for generations. Our parents fled it when ogres attacked; they became separated.
My father carried me to safety. He later returned and believed Reynald and my mother had perished.
Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies. Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry Reynald to safety.
While my mother didn't survive, Reynald did, and for that I'm grateful. But we both want more - we want our home back.
We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us. Would you go to Weatherleah, and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?
Have you changed your mind? Will you help us reclaim our family home?
Hmmmm... let me see.
Oh, yes. I remember. I think it's directly south of Chorrol. Place was overrun with ogres though. Nasty brutes.
Here, let me show you where it is on your map.
He's Guilbert. I'm Reynald.
What? Either I'm far too drunk, or I'm misunderstanding you. I have a brother? How can that be?
My family was killed long, long ago. At least, that's what I'd been told... perhaps it's time for me to stop drinking.
And he's coming here to see me, you say? Yes, I'd better sober up.
Mystery solved, eh? Reynald had a twin brother. Well, he had all of us fooled.
Reynald Jemane? No, don't know anyone by that name. There's a Guilbert Jemane in town however. Maybe he can help you.
He's staying over at the Newlands Lodge, but you also might find him walking around town. Good luck.
Yes, it's quite odd. Reynald, who I've bumped into several times in Chorrol, acted like I was a complete stranger.
Also, he seemed sober, which is a refreshing change. Usually Reynald is stumbling around Chorrol drunk as can be.
Very odd, but then, it's really none of my business.
My poor brother. I can't help but feel responsible. If he'd never known about me, he'd still be alive.
He's Reynald. I'm Guilbert.
He.... he's alive?
I was told that my mother and brother never survived! This is amazing!
I'll need to go see him at once! You'll have to excuse me; I'd better leave right away.
But, please -- come and see us in Chorrol. It would be wonderful for us both to be able to thank you for helping us find each other again.
Yes, that's me. And apparently some other fellow, as well. Strange thing, that. Knowing that someone else is also you... makes my head hurt.
Why are you here? What do you want? Get out of my house!
The Night Mother? What's this all about? I... I think you should leave now. You hear me? Get out! Gromm! Gromm! we have an intruder!
Dead? Me? There... there must be some mistake.... I'm just an old man! Just an old man!
Oh, please, no! I can pay you! Name your price! Anything! Anything! Please, just let me live!
No! Please! I didn't mean to do it, you understand me? She struggled! I... I told her to just stay still, but she wouldn't listen! I had no choice!
What's the matter with you, huh? You some kind of mute or something? I saw you escape, now you're crazy enough to come back?
Oh, so you want to get cute, do you?  All right then, mate, we'll do this the hard way!
Huh? What are you, some kind of preacher or somethin'? One of them crazies from the Church? I ain't got time for this....
Justice? Hahahahaha! I been avoidin' that all my life, mate! Let me show you how!
They have caused trouble here as well. But they have gold to pay for the trouble. Things are always better when served with gold.
I've been looking into them. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do.
I need you to find Ajum-Kajin and bring him back to me. I want to talk to him.
To bring them down, I need more information. My sources tell me they're trying to expand, and they've set up camp in Glademist Cave.
I want you to go there and capture Ajum-Kajin, one of their leaders. Bring him back to me. I'd like to spend some time... talking to him.
I just don't trust them. I know they're efficient -- a bit too efficient for my liking. Some endeavors demand time and care.
I spit on them. Mercenaries sent by the Emperor to reclaim territory in Black Marsh. When they failed, they came back and set up shop.
They've been undercutting us on contracts ever since, and they've no qualms about accepting jobs no guild member would be caught dead doing.
You've done what? I... I had no idea it had gotten so bad. How is it you accomplished all of this?
Haven't you heard of 'em? Former soldiers, sent down into the swamps to take some territory back from the lizards. Talk to Vantus.
Mercenaries is what they are, and they've hung up a shingle here in Leyawiin. Vantus can tell you more.
There's nothing new I can tell you about jobs for your guild.
Jobs for the Fighters Guild? Hmmm... try Margarte. If she's not at home or at the Five Claws, she's probably out looking for alchemical ingredients.
Jobs around here? Don't know that I trust you enough to recommend you to anyone.
My men and I should be able to keep busy for now. Thank you for your help.
Find ingredients for Margarte, huh? Works for me. I'll let the other men know. Appreciate your help, friend. And Oreyn should be happy.
Jobs would be great. Too bad no one is giving us any these days. If you can find some work for us, we'll do it.
Come back when you've got the ectoplasm, and we'll talk about those other men getting work from me.
Well, you've got the ectoplasm! Seems you Fighters Guild types can do a job when you put your mind to it.
Tell your men I'll pay them for minotaur horns and ogre teeth. The Fighters Guild will be my sole supplier. I look forward to doing more business.
I suppose I've got something I could use the Guild's help with. I need ogre teeth and minotaur horn for my alchemy experiments.
They're tough to get, but I prefer fresh, and I'll pay well. And I just don't trust those Blackwood Company folks to find them.
I'm not sure about you, either. Tell you what. If you bring me back five portions of ectoplasm, I'll give my business to the guild. That's my offer.
I suppose I've got something I could use the Guild's help with, but I don't know you well enough to talk about it.
Like I told you, I can use minotaur horn and ogre teeth. If your Guild brothers bring me some, I'll pay well.
I might have something, but I don't know you well enough to trust you'll do it.
Looks like you found work for us. Good. Need some money.
Work is good for money. You know something, tell Vantus. He'll put me to work. Give me money.
Jobs are good. I need more money. So I need more jobs. For money.
It appears we'll be busy for the foreseeable future. Thank you.
Some work would be a gift from the gods. If you've found something, tell Vantus.
I'd love some work. Seems like joining the Blackwood Company is the only way to get it, though.
Perhaps they will cause no more. Perhaps they will have the gold to pay for their drinks.
Causing trouble, yes. Causing much trouble. Scaring customers. Breaking furniture. Bad, bad men.
There are some folks causing trouble, that's for sure. Head over to the Five Claws Lodge. You'll see.
I suppose you got sent down here to stop them. Good. We've tried, but they won't listen. Head over to the Five Claws. You can't miss them.
The Blackwood Company has taken that much of a foothold in Leyawiin. Those sons of....
Never mind. You've done your job. Here's your payment for it.
You've stopped them from fighting. Now find out why it went on. Then do something about it!
Some of your brothers have been getting rowdy at the local tavern. I've got no problem with cutting loose, but I don't like it when we all look bad.
You're looking for Rellian, Vantus Prelius, and Dubok gro-Shagk. I haven't had any trouble with them before, so find out what's going on.
I don't think so. I'll tell you what real trouble is. It's trying to pay my debtors when there's no work. It's my wife taking in wash to buy food.
That's been the state of things since the Blackwood Company began moving in.
No trouble here. No nothing here! No fun. No work. Nothing! Blackwood Company's got all the work. There's nothing left for us! 'Cept for drinking.
Trouble? Trouble? You're damn right! But it's not us, friend. The real trouble's with the Blackwood Company. They're what's causing trouble.
You did it? I'll be talking to Maglir soon. I don't need one wet-ear covering for another. Still, the job got done. Here's the reward.
He didn't? Hmph. This doesn't sit well with me. Not well at all. Still, the job got done. Let's hope your friend Maglir has learned a lesson here.
You found it, huh? Good work, I guess. Well, take it back to Oreyn, then. He can pay you on the contract. Tell him what you want about me.
That was my job. They said it was in Fallen Rock Cave. You ever been in there? Didn't think so. I'm not going back. Not for that kind of money.
If you care that much, you go find it. The contract's yours. It's not worth it for what the Guild is paying. I've got a family to think about.
You've got the journal. Good. So, what happened in Skingrad?
I know that he's defaulted. I need that job done. Don't come back here until you have Brenus Astis' journal in your little hands.
He's not doing the job? The little vermin. It still needs to be done. You get back there and make sure that job is finished! Get moving!
He didn't finish out a contract in Skingrad. Suppose I shouldn't be surprised. He's raw, like you. Go and find out what's wrong with him.
Wish I knew what happened. He had a contract for a local mage in Bravil. Didn't seem like a particularly difficult assignment.
He hasn't reported to the client at all. Get yourself down to Bravil and find Maglir. Make sure that contract of his gets done. And send him to me.
Defaulted? I suppose so. I'm not paid enough to do the job. I was supposed to find Brenus Astis' Journal.
Defaulted? That all you talk about? I'm Blackwood Company now. Plenty of work, the pay is good, and I don't have Oreyn on my back all the time.
The Champion? He was on the second floor last I saw him.
He's around here somewhere. Has been for days. No trouble, really.
The Bosmer? I've seen him at the West Weald Tavern. Been there for days, from what I hear. Better go see him.
Oh. Him. He's been around. Mostly at the West Weald staring at the bottom of a flagon of ale.
What happens to Maglir now isn't your concern. I'll deal with him.
So, I assume you've dealt with Maglir. Tell me about why he defaulted on his contract.
Yes. Maglir. Find him. See why he defaulted. I swear, I've scraped things off the bottom of my boots that were smarter than you.
He's one of your Fighters Guild brothers, but he's defaulted on a contract. We can't allow that. Makes us all look bad.
I need to know why he defaulted on his contract. What have you learned?
I'm Maglir. What do you want?
I've got my orders for now. Check back in a month or so, and we can talk about what to do next.
Well, you're in charge. You won't be doing the contracts, but the Master is always paid a percentage of the Guild's monthly take.
Check with me monthly to give orders for the month.  I'll make it happen. If I don't hear from you, I'll follow the previous month's orders.
You can find your monthly stipend in the Master's Chest upstairs, along with anything we find that you might find useful. Here's the key.
So, what are your first orders, Guildmaster?
You're the boss. What orders do you have?
Duties for you. Fine. I'll speak slowly so you can keep up. I want you to contact Maglir.
I assume you've taken care of this issue. So, tell me what happened. Why were our men causing trouble? And what did you do?
Fine. You know what's wrong. How about you go and fix it? NOW!!!
You've calmed them down. That's good. Now go find out what the hell is going on down there! Look past the symptoms, fool!
I don't have anything for you to do yet. Come back after you've taken care of some more contracts.
Back for more work, are you? Good. Some of our boys are causing trouble in Leyawiin. Looks bad for the guild.
You and Viranus are to go to Nonwyll and find out what happened to Galtus Previa. Now get to it.
I've got another job for you, slightly off the record. You'll be going on a mission with Viranus Donton. Yes -- the Guildmaster's son.
Good that you took care of it. This whole Blackwood Company business is starting to chafe.
Take care of Maglir's contract. Then report back to me.
He's what??? That little lump of guar dung! You get back to Bravil and take care of that contract. I need to think about this.
You need to track down Maglir. Again. Look for him in Bravil. Now go.
I'm going to need you to find Maglir again. The little fetcher.
Duty. That's what all this is about, isn't it? The Blackwood Company is destroying us. They steal our contracts; they steal our members.
It's our duty to strike back. We need to make a move against them. And we need to do it now.
We'll talk later. Meet me at my house after dark.
I've got something for you, but we're not going to talk about it here. I want you to meet me at my house after sundown. We'll talk more then.
I've got another job for you. It's a sensitive one. I need you to find Viranus Donton.
It is clear to me what must be done. The Hist tree must be destroyed.
We obviously didn't get enough information from the Argonian. I want you to infiltrate them. See how they work from the inside.
While the information we got from the Argonian was valuable, we need more. I want you to infiltrate them. See how they work from the inside.
These certainly won't be official duties. Fact is, you'll likely be expelled from the Guild if Vilena gets wind of the fact that you're here.
And I've already been expelled. Doesn't mean I'm done, though. I'm taking down the Blackwood Company, and I want your help doing it.
I don't have anything for you right now. Speak with Azzan or gro-Khash. Get some more seasoning, and maybe I'll have something.
Or, perhaps you're ready for advancement.
For now, Modryn Oreyn will be handling your duty assignments. Please speak with him.
We are a brotherhood, a family. What affects one of us affects us all. Fighting, drunkenness, dereliction of duty are not tolerated.
I would like you to speak with Modryn Oreyn. He will assign you any duties that are currently pending. Good luck to you.
Your first duty should be to name your second-in-command. I can think of no one better for this job than Modryn Oreyn.
Should he accept the position, you would be well-served. Rely on his wisdom and experience more than I did, my friend. Good luck.
You will be asked to perform certain duties for the Guild. These are mainly internal matters--discipline problems, defaulted contracts, and the like.
You've got some experience with the Guild now, so report to Vilena Donton in Chorrol. I'm sure she'll have work for you there.
It's your choice, of course. If you should change your mind, feel free to speak to me again about it.
Fine by me. No great loss. Let me know if you change your mind, though. We can always use fresh meat.
Sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, let me know.
We appreciate your interest, but I understand you've got a bounty on your head. Take care of that, and we'll consider your application.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you've got a bit of a bad reputation. Make a better name for yourself, and perhaps we can accept your application.
Excellent. You are now an Associate in the Fighters Guild. You should report to either Azzan in Anvil or Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal for contracts.
Hmmm... I don't think so. You're a wanted criminal. Don't know what you did, but I know the rules. Come back if you clear that up.
Hmph. Word on the street is that you've been into some bad business. That's not good for the Guild. Clean up your act and come back later.
Good, I guess. You're now an Associate in the Fighters Guild. Report to me or Azzan in Anvil for contracts. And don't screw up.
Yes. Unfortunately, it seems you have a price on your head. Clear that up, and perhaps we can speak about this again.
We appreciate your interest, but you've got quite a nasty reputation. Do something about that, and perhaps we'll consider your application.
Fine. You are now an Associate in the Fighters Guild. For contracts, speak either with me or with Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal. Good luck to you.
If you're interested, see Vilena Donton in Chorrol, or Azzan in Anvil, or Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal.
The Fighters Guild is always looking for new members. If you've got a clean record, and don't have a bounty on your head, we may be able to use you.
Are you interested in joining?
Hmmm... I suppose there's always room for fresh meat. Of course, we like our meat to be clean -- good reputation, not wanted by the law. You in?
We might be able to use someone of your talents... if you've got a clean record, and a good reputation. Are you interested?
Oh, no.
Oh, my....
I'm so sorry.
That's terrible.
That's just terrible.
I feel so bad for you.
That's so sad.
What a shame.
That's horrible.
Are you sure? That's awful.
That's terrible!
By the gods!
Oh, no!
It can't be!
What!?!?!
No!!!!
Why... I ought to...
Impossible!
Unacceptable!
That's not possible!
This will not do.
Grrrrr....
By the gods, no!
This cannot be!
Fantastic!
That's great!
What great news!
Fine.
Please! You'll make me blush!
Goodness. Well, I hope you don't say that to all the girls.
You shouldn't have. That's very kind of you.
Really? How thoughtful.
Good.
Excellent.
Really?
No! really?
Are you sure?
Seriously?
No! Come on!
I had no idea!
Is this true?
What?!
Why, I never knew!
Oh, my!
I'm sorry.
Hmph. I care little.
Oh.
Really? What a shame.
Ummmm....
I hope things get better.
How about that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Hooray!
I suppose that's good.
Exactly.  Sometimes I think he's following me.  I've tried to talk to him but he always hurries off when he sees me coming.
Good!
Good to hear.
Great!
Good for you.
Hmph....
That's fine news.
Ummmm...
That is good news.
Hmmmm...
Certainly not.
Not really.
Absolutely not.
No, no.
No, sir.
Uh uh.
Of course not.
Not a chance.
No way.
Nah.
Nope.
No.
Absolutely.
Of course.
Yes.
Without question.
No doubt.
Indeed.
Yeah. I'll be there.
Wouldn't miss it.
Sure.
Fantastic! Thanks for asking.
Good. And you?
Fine. And you?
Okay. You?
Been better. How about you?
I've been better.
Terrible. Just terrible.
Awful. You?
Awful. I don't want to talk about it.
Who now will save us from the coming darkness?
This can only lead to your death. My guardians are sworn to protect me.
Your destiny calls you down a different road. Please help us.
Interesting.
You think?
Go on....
I hear you.
I've heard others say the same.
So I've heard.
Ahhh....
Oh?
Good to know.
Really.
Uh-huh....
Well.
Hmmmmmm....
You don't say.
Why are you talking to me? Go away.
Do I look like I want to talk to you?
Is there something that makes you think I want to talk to you?
Are you talking to me? Don't.

Okay, we'll keep following you.
Right! We're off!
Please, keep looking. I know it's out there somewhere. You'll find it eventually.
You mean there are still ogres there?
I hate to ask more of you, my friend, but you know that we're not warriors.
Please let us know when it is safe to travel there. We're anxious to return.
Wonderful! Weatherleah is ours!
Are you ready to take us there now?
Are you sure? I don't know what we could offer you to change your mind, but I'm sure we could come up with something. Please reconsider.
Thank you! Now, we're not quite sure where the estate is located. We'll offer up what we know, however.
We believe it's somewhere south of Chorrol, but north of Fort Carmala. It may be difficult to find.
Since no one's lived there for many years, it may be quite overgrown by now. If you find it, let us know. We'll be waiting anxiously.
Oh, well. Been good knowing you, kid. Back to being His Hound for me. As for you... good luck, I guess. I've met worse.
Look, keep the sword if you want. That's your decision. But don't give it back to Clavicus. He doesn't know what's good for him sometimes.
I'm telling you: don't bring that sword back to Clavicus. It'll ruin him, I'm sure. I mean, not completely: He's still a Daedra Prince and all that.
Good move, kid. Some things are better left alone. Let's get back to the Shrine. I'll smooth things over with the big guy. I'm sure he'll understand.
Sure, he'll be a bit put off, but you won't be dead. At least, you probably won't. That's better odds than you're getting here.
This is your out, friend. Leave it alone. How about we just march on back to the shrine and tell Clavicus the deal is off?
Clavicus has always been a little blind to that. And it'll end badly this time, too. So, just leave things be. Walk away. It's your best bet, really.
A word of advice here. You've made a bad deal. This Umbra -- bad business. Things always end badly where that one's concerned.
I've also been a Redguard. For a while I was a scamp, making deals with Orcs. But, for now, I am His Hound, and I serve the Lord Clavicus.
Good. Got your attention. I'm Barbas, the Hound of Clavicus Vile. Not that I've always been a hound, or always been called Barbas.
Hello? Hey! Pay attention! In your pack. The dog. I swear, you heroes aren't particularly quick on the uptake....
You would dare?!?! We had a bargain, little hero. You would risk my wrath for a pitiful little sword? I will be watching you mortal. And waiting.
Now, I have business to attend to. Run along. Perhaps I'll be looking for you again....
Excellent! A pitiful sword with a pitiful soul in exchange for a Masque fit for a god. You've gotten the better of this bargain, mortal.
You've brought the sword! Now give it to me, as we agreed. Umbra and I have unfinished business.
You would break our bargain? You dare to trifle with me? Take care, mortal. Clavicus Vile watches you now. And waits.
Bring the sword to me, and I'll reward you with my Masque. You'll not find a better bargain, mortal. Begin your search in Pell's Gate.
You will retrieve for me a sword, a very special sword. It contains the soul of Umbra, a hero I have had dealings with in the past.
A mortal! Wonderful. Always a pleasure. Perhaps you'll do a service for me, mortal. And I'll reward you. A fair bargain, don't you think?
The priory is a chapterhouse of the Order of Talos. And with the last Septim emperor dead, and all his heirs...
Tiber Septim is the god and patron saint of our order. And now his dynasty has come to an end. It's very painful.
I was just here reading the Black Horse Courier about the assassination, and looking through 'A Short Life'.
Uriel was an old man... a good man, and a good emperor. Why would anyone want to kill him? And all his sons?
Weynon Priory is a monastery devoted to the praise and worship of Talos and the Nine Divines.
Brother Piner, Father Jauffre, and I are members of the Order of Talos.
Eronor, a lay brother, tends after the sheep and our little farm.
We're a Nine Divines priory dedicated to the Order of Talos. Lord Talos teaches us to be prepared to protect his people in peace and war.
I'm on night watch here, in case someone needs the chapel, or wants to talk... or has mysterious business, like you.
I was just writing a letter to my mother. She's quite upset by the assassinations.
A chapterhouse of the Order of Talos, a monastic order connected to the Blades. It's located on the Black Road just outside of Chorrol.
Brother Piner is a fine young monk, zealous and energetic. In time, I hope he may add patience and prudence to his list of virtues.
Surprised by Eronor's uncanny way with sheep?
Perhaps it would interest you to know that Eronor's sister, Dagail, in Leyawiin, is an accomplished spellcrafter.
Over here! Quickly!
In the cage! Over here!
You will, soldier. Once they're secure, get back here immediately. We'll need every available blade, and there'll be plenty of fighting to go around.
Very well. The area outside the Chapel has been cleared, and these people need to be taken to safety. Escort them to the camp south of here at once.
That's it? There's no one else?
Civilians! It's time to move out! Let's go!
Sir, yes sir!
But, sir! I want to help fight!
There were others, sir. But they refused to stay put. We tried to convince them it was dangerous, but they left anyway. I guess they didn't make it.
Sir, we're all that's left. Berich Inian, myself, and these civilians.
Then Lord Dagon shall drink your blood instead.
Lord Dagon thirsts for red-drink. Sate him.
Oh. I was hoping to see if I was on the right track. Well, if you bring them to me I may be able to help you with your puzzle.
Excellent. Let's see ... yes! The first letter of each paragraph spells out a message!
Write this down: "Green Emperor Way Where Tower Touches Midday Sun."
Are you familiar with Green Emperor Way? The gardens around the Imperial Palace. Something must be revealed there at noon! How exciting!
I hear the legions have been recalled from Fort Swampmoth in Black Marsh, and many of the Argonian slaves have returned to their tribes.
Many Argonians say they have been "called back" to Black Marsh. They disappear into the swamps and are never seen again.
Black Marsh has become more dangerous than ever. Many settlers have been lost, and most non-Argonians have left in fear.
It seems that these are turbulent times in the land of the Dunmer.
Morrowind has always been a troubling place. It seems it is moreso now.
It is not surprising, considering Morrowind's violent past. We can only hope the troubles subside quickly.
The land of the Argonians is a strange place indeed.
I have heard Argonia is a strange and treacherous place. It is no wonder odd things are happening there.
I've heard many tales of Black Marsh. It sounds like a truly mysterious place.
I'm not surprised. It seems that Skyrim is always involved in a border dispute.
More fighting for the Nords? This is sad news.
The Nords have always been protective of their territory. It's no wonder they get involved in these disputes.
It seems Summerset Isle has become a much more dangerous place.
The Altmer have powerful wizards. It could be a dangerous situation.
That skooma trade is bad business, and the Renrijra Krin are just a bunch of thugs.
If the Empire isn't going to stop the skooma trade, who will?
They say syndicates of wizards have led a boycott of Imperial goods in the land of the Altmer.
I understand Daedra worship has become increasingly prevalent in the Summerset Isle.
I have heard that the Great Houses of Morrowind are in upheaval. Indoril is in ruins, and Redoran is besieged by the Nords of Skyrim.
They say that slavery has been abolished in Morrowind. House Dres and Hlaalu have renounced the slave trade, and freed the beastfolk from servitude.
Rumor has it the Nerevarine has left Morrowind on an expedition to Akavir, and has not been heard from since.
They say that King Helseth has made an alliance with House Dres. Together they pick apart the carcass of ruined Indoril.
I hear that the Nords of Skyrim have been warring with the Redoran of Morrowind.
I have heard that Nord warriors have travelled from Skyrim with Orc mercenaries to assault the Redoran of Morrowind.
There are rumors that the Nords are attempting to capture the whole of Solstheim, and remove the Imperial fort on the island.
The skooma trade is making a lot of money for the tribes in Elsweyr, and a lot of that is going to the Renrijra Krin.
Sounds like the Empire has given up on stopping the skooma trade in Elsweyr, and I hear tribal chiefs are supporting the Renrijra Krin.
Nothing I'd like to talk about.
This is most disturbing. We can only hope this madness is over soon.
This is unbelievable. How can the gods let this happen?
It seems it is a dire situation throughout all of Tamriel.
I have heard things are bad in Vvardenfell. The Telvanni do their best to close the gates, but it is to no avail.
I've heard nothing good. In Morrowind, they say the man-god Vivec has gone missing. Some believe he has been taken by the daedra.
Many are dead in the land of the Dunmer. Even St. Jiub, who drove the cliffracers from Vvardenfell, has fallen to the daedra hordes.
The news has not been good. I've heard it said that the daedra have overrun the town of Ald'ruhn. The entire town has been destroyed.
There is grave news from Skyrim. From Falkreath to Windhelm, the foul daedra attack the land.
I hear all of Skyrim is under siege. The daedra lay waste to the Old Holds, and there is little to do to stop it.
There are foul tidings from Skyrim. The Greybeards speak of the end of all times.
Then we have no further business at this time. Return when you have gathered the supplies.
No? Then I suggest you return to the world and gather them. We have nothing to discuss otherwise.
Very good. For retrieving these items, your status in the guild will be restored.
Know, however, that you have only one more such chance available to you. The guild does not take these infractions lightly.
Now, you may continue about your business.
You do not have all the materials you were told to collect.
Return when you have everything.
You have completed your task, and so your privileges in the guild will be restored.
Know this: there will be no further leniency. Any more violations, and you will be permanently expelled from the guild.
Would you even now attempt to trick me? You do not have what I requested.
Return only when you have the ingredients. You waste my time otherwise.
They.... they didn't make it? Oh god. They died out there all alone...
I should've been with them! It should've been me, not them!
I... I'm sorry. You did all you could, I'm sure. Thank you for trying.
I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you - what little money I have must now be spent on burials. Please, if you'll excuse me.
I... I've lost a son? No! It can't be!
I should've been with them! It should've been me, not one of them!
I'm afraid I have little to offer you - what little money I have must now be spent on a burial. Please, if you'll excuse me.
My boys are safe! Oh, thank you!
Thanks so much for sticking with them and helping a foolish old man. Please, take this... I won't be needing it any longer. My battles are over.
I plan to live out my days on the farm in peace and quiet.
Watch over them, and keep them safe. I couldn't bear to lose them to those monsters.
Yes, Rallus and Antus. They're going to fight off the creatures at our farm, but I fear for their safety.
While the Brotherhood maintains its ancient name, membership is always open to skilled women. For can we not draw blood as well as any man?
The Night Mo.... No! No! Guards! Guards! Help me! Somebody help! Assassin!
Make no mention of the book to him. It's just the sort of thing he'd want to get his scaly little hands on.
I'd have a few choice words for him, but he won't let me get near him. I know exactly why he's so threatened by me.
He's desperately trying to control as much power as he can, and I'm a threat, because I don't want to see that power all in his hands.
Anyone capable of handling it should have access to that power, don't you think?
Our hall doesn't offer much in the way of training. I can teach some basic Alteration skills, but that's about it.
The guild is a wonderful resource for those interested in magic. Talk to Falcar if you wish to join, or any other local guild leader.
Adrienne may read too much, but you should see the Summon spell she taught Vigge. He might teach you, if you're skilled enough.
Adrienne can make you a member of the guild, if you can convince her to take her nose out of whatever book she's reading.
We're all better off now that Necromancy has been banned from the guild. It's just safer that way.
Each local guild hall has its own way of doing things. That means each hall has its own set of problems.
The Mystic Archives have a large collection of books. Look around, and you may learn a thing or two.
I am in the Mage's Guild.
If you're skilled enough, Athragar has a rather powerful frost spell for sale. Very effective, but dangerous to the inexperienced.
You'll want to talk to Teekeeus, if you're interested in joining the guild. Any other leader of a local guild hall can help you as well.
Carahil's a good leader. She's been a staunch supporter of the Council of Mages for as long as I've known her.
If you're applying to join the guild, you'll need to speak with one of the local guild heads. Carahil would be the one to talk to here.
It's my job to help people learn the proper, constructive use of Destruction magic. And let's face it... blowing things up can be ever so much fun.
You'll need to talk to Kud-Ei if you want to join the guild. Or any of the heads of the local guild halls, for that matter.
Guild members who have access to the University can craft their own spells, not to mention chat with the most important people in the guild.
There's at least one person in every guild hall who offers spells; check at every hall to make sure you don't miss any.
I can't imagine how the average person gets by without our extra services. No spell-crafting, and no enchanting? It must be awful.
You want to join? You'll need to speak with one of the local guild heads. That'd be Carahil here in Anvil.
Druja has a wide variety of spells for sale, if there's something you need. Most of them are simple, but they're a good starting point.
The guild offers magical supplies to the citizens of Tamriel, but has far greater benefits for its members. Talk to Dagail if you'd like to join.
If you need training, Athragar has a reputation for being very good with Alteration. You might consider speaking to him about it.
If you want to join the guild, you can ask any of the local guild leaders. Here in Chorrol, Teekeeus is the one you'll need to see.
I don't like talking to people much, but Kud-Ei's helping me get over that. That's why she put me in charge of selling alchemy supplies.
You'll need to speak to one of the local guild heads to get into the guild. Talk to Kud-Ei if you just can't wait.
I'm just here doing research. If you need spells, talk to Ita or Delphine. They'll be happy to help.
You want to join? Well, then either you'll  need to find Kud-Ei here in town, or go seek out one of the other local guild hall leaders.
It's a shame that Selena doesn't join in our fun, but she takes her role as an Alchemist very seriously. If you need supplies, she's the one to see.
If you're looking to join the guild, talk to Jeanne Frasoric. If nothing else, it means access to better services than most people enjoy.
Trayvond has the best shield spell outside of the Arcane University. If you can cast it, it's definitely worth adding to your selection.
The guild offers access to spells you can't find anywhere else. See Falcar here in town if you'd like to join.
Orintur doesn't like to brag, but no one can match the Reflect spells he can cast. He might teach you one, if you're skilled enough.
Have you considered joining the guild? Falcar can admit you, if you'd like. So can the leader of any of the other local guild halls.
Arch-Mage Traven was right to ban Necromancy, and place restrictions on the addition of new members to the guild. He's served us well.
The guild is still powerful in Cyrodiil, but poor decisions in the recent past have weakened it. Perhaps killed it. We shall see.
Hrmph. Think they're all so high and mighty, that they've somehow got a monopoly on power.
If you wish to become a part of the Mages Guild, seek out the heads of the local guild halls. They will instruct you further.
I wish I were qualified to have access to the Arcane University. Enchanting items whenever I want... ah, well. Maybe someday.
I keep to myself around here. If you want to join the guild, go find Teekeeus. He's in charge of that sort of stuff here in Chorrol.
Delphine can get you a spell to summon bound armor, if you're interested. And if you're able, of course.
Kud-Ei would be the one to talk to, if you wish to join. Otherwise, just find one of the other local guild heads.
Volanaro has a twisted sense of humor, but he also has a few nice spells up his sleeve. If you want to summon a Bound sword, talk to him.
You should think about joining the guild. If you're interested, talk to Jeanne Frasoric or one of the other local guild hall leaders.
The guild can provide you with some training, but the best trainers are usually very hard to find.
The guild has quite a few connections, and it always helps to know the right people, wouldn't you say? You should think about joining.
The Arcane University has been here for nearly as long as the Mages Guild has been in Cyrodiil. It has been our home for ages.
There's not much to do here in the Bruma Guild. If you can get to the Arcane University, though, they let you make your own spells there.
Have you thought of joining? There's a free place to rest in every town for you. That's got to be worth something.
All of the local guild halls sell some amount of Alchemic ingredients, but for the best stuff, you'll need to do some exploring on your own.
The Mages Guild is the single best resource for Alchemists in all of Cyrodiil. If Alchemy interests you, talk to Dagail about joining.
The guild lost a good number of members when Traven banned the practice of Necromancy, but some of us stayed behind.
The guild isn't what it once was, but it's still worth being a member. Talk to Dagail if you want to join.
You may need to ask around, but training in all the schools of magic can be found at our various guild halls.
There's no place like it in Cyrodiil; it's truly one-of-a-kind. You should think about joining. Dagail can make you a member, if you like.
Between the two of them, Borissean and Gaspar have mastered nearly every type of spell there is. You'd be wise to go see them if you can.
The best spells are closely guarded by the guild, but are available to high-ranking members. You should consider joining.
If you're looking for the most powerful spells, you'll want to speak to Borissean at the Arcane University. If you're allowed in, that is.
If you want to make a name for yourself as a mage, you simply must join the guild. Talk to Falcar if you're interested.
If you're looking to create your own enchantments, you've come to the right place.
Gaspar and I have learned a great many spells over the years. Once you''ve learned them, you can use the knowledge to create your own.
Training and spells, training and spells. It gets so boring after a while; maybe someday I'll be able to move to the Arcane University.
Are you interested in joining? You'll need to talk to Teekeeus, then. Otherwise, just talk to the head of any of the local guild halls.
Carahil supported Arch-Mage Traven's appointment from the beginning, and I don't believe the rumors that she just wanted his job at this hall.
Any of the local guild heads can get you into the guild. If you're in a hurry, speak with Carahil. She should be somewhere around here.
Only mages who have gotten recommendations from all the local guild halls can enter the Arcane University. It's a good policy, I think.
Are you interested in joining the guild? Talk to Falcar here in Cheydinhal, if so. Otherwise, any leader of a local Mages Guild hall can help.
The services provided at the Arcane University are just priceless. You can create your own enchantments there!
I wouldn't have any friends if it weren't for the guild. I'm very grateful. If you want to join, you should talk to Adrienne.
The guild needs you, child. Perhaps it has always needed you; always been waiting for you.
She was unable to acquire the book, and that shall be enough for me. It would be beneath me to continue this petty squabble.
I understand you have spoken with her. As you are new to the guild, I will not hold this against you, but I warn you to be wary of her.
She deals in half-truths at best, outright lies at worse. If you have any information about her, or about her intentions, I expect you to inform me.
She and I have an unpleasant history. She does not care for Guild regulations, and errantly believes I am mis-using my powers.
I have seen that she is in town. Though she has not approached me, I know she wants something. I would like you to find out what it is.
Determine what she's after, and how we may be rid of her. I do not want her here, spreading her lies.
She is a scavenger, and has no respect for the power of the Arcane arts. She has no business here, and I will not aid her in any way.
I highly suggest that you make no effort to associate with her.
All I heard is that she's looking for some sort of book. You'll have to talk to her if you want to know more.
Haven't you seen her around town? She's either at the Grey Mare, or she's skulking around the Mages Guild, it seems.
She's nothing but trouble. She went to the University long ago, but was expelled from the guild. Caused all kinds of trouble while she was there.
I think Teekeeus was the one who finally blew the whistle on her. That'd be just like him too; always playing by the rules.
I passed her the other day. You wouldn't believe the look she gave me! Whatever happened, she's taking it out on the whole guild.
I'd steer clear of her if I were you. She has it in for Teekeeus, and wouldn't hesitate to take any of us down with him.
She's staying in one of the rooms upstairs, though she seems to spend most of her time down by the Mages Guild.
I don't know what her problem is, and I don't care. Her money's good, and that's all I need to know.
I don't know all the details, but I heard that she complained to the Council until they removed Teekeeus from his position at the Arcane University.
Filthy vermin!
I'm out of patience with you, prisoner!
Don't push me, prisoner.
You don't want to do that again.
Slink away, then, bug. Stay far, far from Mephala's web.
Leave Mephala an offering of nightshade at the shrine between midnight and dawn, and the Webspinner may grant you an audience.
Of course you won't. Go on about your dreary existence. The Lord Sanguine has no interest in one such as yourself.
Approach then, and bring Sanguine a gift. Some Cyrodilic Brandy is an appropriate gift for your host.
It is a place of celebration for us. We dance, we make love. Would you speak with Sanguine?
Then leave this place, before the Lord Molag Bal decides that your eternal torment might prove amusing.
If you believe yourself worthy, present Molag Bal with an offering: the pelt of a lion.
She was a good woman, and Melus loved her as best he could. He was off fighting when she died. A sudden fever, and she was gone.
Don't think he ever forgave himself for not being there when she passed. He swore then never to raise a weapon again.
He lives alone now. Moved into a cabin not far outside of town. It's near where he buried Vena. I understand he visits her grave every day.
Please, I do not wish to speak of her. My wife is buried here, and I only wish to visit her grave in peace. It is a sacred place to me.
She was my wife, and I would rather not speak of her now.
Blessed are you, who has spoken to the Corrupter.
You have been told what must be done.
What is your business at the Shrine of Molag Bal, the Tormentor of Men?
I know of the poor man. Did wonders for folks around here. There was no job too small for him.
Killed off hordes of goblins when they attacked the town. Killed off a nest of minotaurs singlehandedly. That's all in the past now, though.
Since his wife, Vena, died, we haven't seen hide nor hair of the man. Gone off by himself.
I know of him, but I don't figure I need to tell you about it.
I am Melus Petilius. Leave me in peace to mourn my wife, Vena.
A wise choice. I have spilled too much blood already, and though I hunger for more, spilling yours would not please me. Go now. Do not return.
Come, then. Try your luck. Feel the bite of Umbra.
Can't say for sure. Some say they've seen her nearby, near the Vindasel Ruins. Might just be wishful thinking, though.
If she's around, she hasn't come into Pell's Gate. Nor should she. I fear that girl is long gone.
If you seek her out, take care. She's a powerful one. Or at least that sword is. I'd steer clear if I was you.
Who is Umbra? I can tell you who Umbra used to be. Lenwin. She's my apprentice. Or at least she was, until she found that sword.
Never did say where it came from. She just showed up with it one day. Said it was called Umbra. But she was different.
She'd always been fair with a sword, but she began looking for fights. Became bloodthirsty. Then started calling herself Umbra, after the sword.
Finally signed on with some mercenaries, but I hear that ended, too. We haven't seen her in years.
It's a powerful sword, no doubt about that. Jet black. Got a wicked edge on it, and they say it can steal a man's soul.
I know of at least one soul it stole. Lenwin. She's the one who found the blasted thing. I suppose you want to hear about the person now.
Then leave this place, until you have better reason to be here.
There are many deals to be made, even with a god. You could find great wealth, or painful death.
If you wish to bargain with Clavicus Vile, approach with an offering of 500 gold, and hope the Lord smiles on your offering.
Umbra? You need to speak with Irroki the Wide. I've got nothing to say about Umbra.
I can't tell you any more than I already have. I'm sorry.
Umbra. That's a name I haven't heard in a while. And it's not one you should be using around Pell's Gate, either.
Before I go on, let's clear something up. Are you here asking about the sword or the person. Which is it?
Aye. I know of Umbra. But you're a stranger to me, and I'm not talking.
Umbra is my blade. It is who I am. Who I was meant to be.
For years, I have fed my blade the souls of man and mer. Warriors and priests, kings and paupers. Men, women, and children. All have bled for me.
I have seen them all fall, and still Umbra hungers for more.
We are a small community. Mostly keep to ourselves. Can't say it isn't nice to see a new face around, though.
It is a small community, not far from here. If Lord Clavicus has sent you there, I suggest you be on your way.
Do not speak to me of that place! It was another lifetime. It was before I became what I am now.
Perhaps they sent you to kill me? Are they worried I might come in the night and burn their village down around them?
No matter. I am what I have become, and I know my fate. But what of you? What is it you seek? My death? My blade?
I offer you a choice, more than I have offered most. Stay here and die, or leave now, and live your life. Speak to me again when your mind is set.
Your deal is made. Return when you have done your part.
Make a bargain or do not. You must choose.
Here we worship Lord Clavicus. Do you have business with the Daedra?
The Plague of Fear. I will not speak of this. Not to any outsider. I'll answer anything else I can. Is there something more?
Perhaps you'd like to know more about Border Watch itself?
Don't you see? The traitor somehow switched your orders, and has been sending you to the wrong dead drops! You and I have been deceived.
We must find out who is behind this betrayal! We haven't much time... I am hunted day and night by the Black Hand! They want me dead!
Here is what you must do. Go now to your next dead drop, lie in wait, and confront whomever drops off the false contract!
Uncover the true traitor's identity, and then come see me. I'll be in hiding. Fort Farragut is no longer secure. It's under watch by the Black Hand.
I'll wait for you at Applewatch, the farm where you killed the old Draconis woman. It should be empty, and safe. Now go! And may Sithis help us all!
The traitor somehow switched your orders, and has been sending you to the wrong dead drops. You and I have been deceived.
The traitor somehow switched your orders, and has been sending you to the wrong dead drops. You and I have been deceived, dear friend.
Your first dead drop contract, you carried that out, killed Celedaen. After that, you eliminated the Draconis family, as ordered. Then, betrayal!
Your dead drops went unvisited, your targets ignored. Instead, you have been systematically killing off all the members of the Black Hand!
J'Ghasta, Shaleez, Alval Uvani, Havilstein Hoar-Blood -- Speakers and Silencers all. And Ungolim... the Listener himself!
The surviving members of the Black Hand know that you're innocent, they know you were only following orders. They believe I am the traitor!
These are the signs as they were foretold. First, there is the Plague of Vermin. It is said our town will be overrun by disease carrying creatures.
Rats, I would imagine. Horrible little things. I always keep a powerful rat poison around in case I see one of the little monsters.
Next is the plague of Famine. It is foretold that our livestock will fall dead in their fields, with no apparent explanation.
We have had some livestock die recently, but not all of them, which is a relief.
We have but the six sheep in our pasture, and we make sure they are well-tended.
I do not believe you are prepared for that kind of knowledge. You are still a stranger to me.
I will tell you nothing of the three signs. You are an unbeliever and a fool.
You would mock our beliefs? Fool! When the three signs are upon us, you will learn!
Wonderful! I would be glad to tell you more.
It has been told from our fathers, and our fathers' fathers, that our time in this place will come to an end.
My great-great-great grandfather, K'Sharra, foretold of a time when we would receive three signs from the gods, signalling the end of the world.
Then you should run along. Fly, fly! Take off, now. Scat! Make tracks. Get going.
Run for your life.
And have a nice day!
Then approach the Shrine.
He might appear. Because it's raining. He loves the rain. Because it's wet. Or because it's rainy. Not so sure.
Of course, you'll need an offering. I think a lesser soul gem, a head of lettuce, and some yarn will do the trick. Yes. That's what Sheogorath wants.
Of course, he won't appear. Because it's not raining. He loves the rain.
And you'll need an offering. I think a lesser soul gem, a head of lettuce, and some yarn will do the trick. Yes. That's what Sheogorath wants.
I am Ri'Bassa, shaman of the Khajiit of Border Watch.
Ri'Bassa is our shaman. You will find him in his house most of the time.
It has come! We're doomed! Doomed! Run while you can, stranger. Get out!
This certainly seems like one of the signs. It is unnatural to have this many rats gather in one place.
I can only hope that the rat poison I have put down will take care of them all. It is a powerful poison, though, so it should do the trick.
You know of the K'Sharra Prophecy? How odd! Are you some sort of scholar?
A stranger who knows about the K'Sharra Prophecy? It is one of our many prophecies. You should speak with Ri'Bassa, our shaman.
Killed and ate a Bosmer there. But it made me sick. Saw Lord Sheogorath in the vomitus, so that's all right. Here to sacrifice? A limb would be nice.
Shh! There's someone here! Wait until they leave!
You're right. I know. I'm just worried. I'll try to calm down.
And have one of your nosy friends snoop around here and steal it? No, it's safer in Tidewater Cave.
We should go get it right now.
No fisherman is going into Tidewater Cave. It's full of trolls. We have to sneak past them, remember?
But what if a fisherman uses the cave?
Trolls don't like water. Trolls don't swim. The Eye is perfectly safe in Tidewater Cave. So relax.
But what if the trolls eat it?
Bejeen? Bejeen knows nothing. Bejeen tells stories. Silly Bejeen. Shame on Bejeen to tell such silly, silly stories.
I did no such thing. I think perhaps you've been spying on me. Yes... spying! You cannot have my treasure!
Tidewater Cave? Tidewater Cave! Why... why do you ask about this place?
There is no need to speak of that place. It is a bad place.
I... I know nothing of the place. Just an old cave, from what I hear.
Tidewater Cave? I know of it. Down along the southern coast. Nasty place, from what I hear. Full of all sorts of critters.
An ancient relic of the first Emperor, who became the divine Talos, the patron of our Order.
After the Battle of Sancre Tor, Tiber Septim gave his armor to the Blades in honor of our role in his victory.
The Blades built a shrine in the catacombs of Sancre Tor, on the spot where Tiber Septim received the blessing of Akatosh.
The Armor has been there ever since. Before evil came to Sancre Tor, this shrine was a place of pilgrimage for all Blades.
But no one has visited the shrine and lived to tell the tale in centuries.
You have earned a place of honor in the rolls of our Order for recovering the holy relic.
The Septim blood may flow through my veins, but you have the soul of a hero. The Armor of Tiber Septim himself! Jauffre will be amazed to see it.
You can reassure Jauffre that I will not destroy the armor. All I need is a scraping of Talos's divine blood.
The Blades are as touchy as priests about relics of Tiber Septim, it seems!
Martin made some progress on the Mysterium Xarxes while you were gone. You should speak to him about it.
Keep working on obtaining the items Martin needs for the ritual.
Everything else is just buying time for us to get the Amulet of Kings back from Mankar Camoran.
You should talk to Jauffre. He needs your help. Trouble down in Bruma, I think.
While you were gone, I've made some progress in deciphering the Mysterium Xarxes ritual. The third item we need is a Great Welkynd Stone.
You may have run across lesser Welkynd Stones; they are fairly common in Ayleid ruins. But a Great Welkynd Stone will not be easy to come by.
They have been plundered one by one over the years, due to their great value to mages and occultists.
There is only one place that is rumored to still contain one: the ruins of the Ayleid city of Miscarcand.
A place where many have perished seeking its Great Stone. But nothing else will do, so you must succeed where all others have failed.
While I continue to study the Mysterium Xarxes, you should keep searching for the Armor of Tiber Septim.
While I continue to study the Mysterium Xarxes, you should keep searching for the daedric artifact we'll need for the ritual.
I won't ask what you went through to obtain this, my friend. I know all too well the depravity of the princes of Oblivion.
Are you ready to give me the artifact? Remember, the ritual will consume its physical form. It won't be seen again on Tamriel for many years.
The only way to obtain a daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric Lords.
The book "Modern Heretics" is the best introduction to daedric cults. The library here has a copy if you need it.
Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its daedric power.
Ah, Azura's Star .. as beautiful as all the tales tell.
This blade has slain many a hero over the years. Tamriel will be better off without it for a while.
Ah, the Masque of Clavicus Vile. You are wise not to let yourself get further enmeshed in his plots.
There is no disguising the bestial nature of some of the daedric Princes.
Who now knows the tale of how this Dwemer hammer came to embody the power of one of their most bitter foes?
Thieves everywhere will curse us both for the loss of this ring, my friend. So be it.
A fearsome weapon, and steeped in the ancient evil of its master. May its deadly power turn good, for once.
I'll sleep better once this keepsake of Namira is gone from my possession. A good choice for our purpose, though.
The merchants of Cyrodiil would sleep more soundly, knowing this Key is gone from the world. But why tell them?
Not many people would give up Spellbreaker for destruction, my friend. Your sacrifice honors me.
I never thought to see this again. I once possessed it, briefly ... a lifetime ago, it seems now ...
To obtain it, and then give it up ... I honor your dedication to our cause.
Good riddance to this tool of mischief.
The world will be better off with this foul thing gone from it.
Not many could resist the temptation of the Oghma Infinium. Now it is my turn to be put to the test!
As you wish. My preparations for the ritual will be different, depending on the artifact we use, so I'll need it as soon as possible.
But why, Sister? What is the point? Why should anyone bother with all that sneaking and skulking?
Yes, yes, of course I value our secrets, and I have never betrayed them! But using stealth to kill.... It's just so... weak.
Bonuses? Ha ha ha ha ha! Useless, I say! Gold and magical trinkets are no substitute for the freedom to slaughter anyone I please, at any time!
My dear Gogron, you are a life-taker for the Dark Brotherhood! Our very existence relies on shadow and deception. Do you not value our secrets?
But Brother, what of the contracts that require subtlety! You must at least strive to earn the bonuses that are offered?
Oh, Gogron! He he he he. Your methods may be crude, but your heart is always in the right place.
The Count has dispatched soldiers to Bruma, as he promised.
The Count has instructed me to tell you that he will be happy to speak to you again once the Oblivion Gate threatening Skingrad is closed.
I believe that the Count may want to handle this matter personally.
Wait here. I will tell the Count you are waiting to see him.
Bruma cannot hold off the hordes of Oblivion alone. You should ask the rulers of the other cities of Cyrodiil to send help.
I had hoped for more help. The Empire will stand or fall with Bruma! Have all the other cities abandoned us?
Your efforts are starting to pay off. Just knowing we do not stand alone has raised the morale of the Bruma Guard.
But I still fear that Bruma will fall before you can complete the ritual. You need to buy Martin more time. Bruma needs more help!
You've done well. The Bruma garrison is much stronger now. We should be able to put up a good fight even against a determined assault.
I hope it is enough. Bruma must hold out until you can complete the ritual and retrieve the Amulet from Mankar Camoran.
You've done better than I had hoped. Bruma's garrison is now as strong as we can make it.
I will not forget your service to me and to Cheydinhal. Rescuing my son from the Oblivion Gate was a daring feat.
With the Oblivion Gate closed, I can now gladly send aid to Bruma.
I will not forget your service to Cheydinhal. Closing the Oblivion Gate outside the city was a daring feat.
I do not blame you for my son's death. He brought that upon himself, as hard as it is for a father to admit.
Since the immediate threat to Cheydinhal is now eliminated, I will grant your request and send reinforcements to Bruma.
My soldiers are brave and capable. They will do their duty.
My first responsibility is to the people of Cheydinhal. They look to me for protection in these dark times.
With an open Oblivion Gate just outside our walls, I cannot risk weakening Cheydinhal's defenses, even for such a worthy cause.
This is terrible news. Under normal circumstances, I would dispatch a legion or two to Bruma immediately.
But the circumstances are not normal, are they?
I've been pleading for troops for Cyrodiil for weeks, but the generals assure me that the entire Imperial Army is already fully committed.
Besides... I'd have a full-scale political crisis on my hands if I tried to pull any troops out of the provinces.
I'm sorry, but the cities of Cyrodiil will have to fend for themselves for the time being.
While I understand Bruma's need, Chorrol's own defense must come first.
I cannot spare any soldiers as long as Chorrol remains under threat from the Oblivion Gate outside our walls.
Mehrunes Dagon has no more love for my kind than for my mortal subjects. Less, perhaps, as we make poor slaves.
You have helped me by closing the Oblivion Gate near Skingrad. I will likewise help you by sending aid to Bruma.
While Skingrad is threatened by an Oblivion Gate, I cannot spare any soldiers for Bruma.
Whatever you may think of me, I still protect my own. This is my city, and Mehrunes Dagon will not have it while I remain Count of Skingrad.
The Count left very specific instructions. He does not want to see you again on this matter until the Oblivion Gate outside Skingrad is closed.
I believe the Count may want to handle this matter personally.
I would like to send help, but unfortunately my guard is short-handed with the death of Captain Lerus. I need all my soldiers at home right now.
Thank you for closing the Oblivion Gate that was threatening Bravil. I will send my guard captain, Viera Lerus, to Bruma's aid.
I've sent Captain Lerus to Bruma. She is one of my best soldiers. I'm glad to be able to help defend the heir to the throne.
I wish I could help. I understand the need to help defend the heir to the throne. It is a duty we all share.
But with an Oblivion Gate threatening Bravil, I need all my soldiers here.
I've heard that you closed the Oblivion Gate outside Anvil. I honor you for your bravery and service to my city.
With Anvil safe for the moment, I will send some of my best soldiers to bolster the Bruma garrison.
Don't worry. Anvil's soldiers are worth two from anywhere else. Bruma will not fall!
I would like to send help to Bruma, but I cannot risk weakening Anvil's defenses with that Oblivion Gate open outside the city.
Well, with the Oblivion Gate near Leyawiin closed, I suppose the immediate threat is lessened.
I will do as you ask. Let no one say Leyawiin did not do its part to uphold the Empire.
I have given you the help you asked for. Bruma's fate is out of my hands.
Leyawiin is beset by enemies. The Empire does nothing to help us. Even before this crisis, I did not have enough men to patrol my borders.
Now, daedra are pouring out of an Oblivion Gate on our very doorstep! No, I don't have any men to spare. Bruma will have to look to its own defense.
I hate to refuse you, my friend. But with the castle still in the hands of those daedra, I need every soldier I have left.
I have few enough men to spare, but you have more than earned our help.
I will send what aid I can. Bruma must not share the fate of our city!
Your reputation precedes you, Hero of Kvatch! You have done my city a great service by closing the Oblivion Gate.
I will now gladly send soldiers to aid in the defense of Bruma. Consider it done.
Won't anyone else send help? We can't be the only city willing to come to Bruma's aid.
Well... some is better than none. But more is always better. Honestly, I'd be happier if we had more men.
We'll give them a good fight. They'll know they tangled with the best Cyrodiil has to offer.
None of the other cities have sent aid. Bruma stands alone.
Only one city has sent aid. My guardsmen are the best in Cyrodiil, but they were never meant to be an army.
Several of the cities have sent aid. They're mustering on the plaza outside the castle, if you want to review the troops.
Most of the cities have sent aid. You've done an excellent job.
All of the other cities have sent aid! It's remarkable! I've never seen such unity of purpose. Your leadership has made all the difference.
Miscarcand is one of the most extensive Ayleid ruins in Cyrodiil. It was the capital of one of the ancient Ayleid kingdoms.
You might find 'Glories and Laments Among the Ayleid Ruins' useful. I have the library's copy at my table if you need it.
The capital of one of the ancient Ayleid kingdoms which flourished in Cyrodiil before the rise of Men.
It is said that the ruins are still haunted by the vengeful spirit of its last king. True or not, it is not a place to enter lightly. Be careful.
You are a wonder! Not only the Hero of Kvatch, but the Master of Miscarcand as well!
Captain Burd is waiting for you outside the Bruma city gate. He'll show you the Oblivion Gate. Although I doubt it will be hard to find.
Good. Have her meet me in the Chapel of Talos for a council of war. That seems a fitting place to make such desperate plans.
I said you weren't going to like it.
The risk is great, I know. I was at Kvatch. I saw the terrible power of the daedric siege engine.
But we have no choice. The only way to recover the Amulet of Kings is to allow the Mythic Dawn to proceed with their plan to attack Bruma.
You're not going to like it. Jauffre doesn't like it. The Countess of Bruma certainly isn't going to like it.
Great Sigil Stones are the anchors of Great Gates. The kind of gate the Mythic Dawn opened at Kvatch.
The kind of Gate the Mythic Dawn wants to open here to destroy Bruma.
I should have seen it sooner.
It's the counterpart to the Great Welkynd Stone, just as the first two were the opposed powers of the daedra and the divines.
Welkynd stones contain the concentrated power of Mundus; their counterparts are Sigil stones, which are used to hold open Oblivion Gates.
A Great Sigil Stone, then, is what we require.
I'm sorry, but I don't know yet. The Xarxes... it clouds my mind and haunts my dreams like nothing I've ever experienced...
But don't worry. I will solve it. I must. I am close, I'm sure of it.
In the meantime, the Bruma Guard need your help to close an Oblivion Gate. Didn't you already speak to Jauffre about that?
The pinnacle of Ayleid magic. Once every Ayleid city had its Great Stone, but they've all been plundered over the centuries.
All but one. The Great Stone of Miscarcand is reputed still to shine in the deep darkness of its ruined halls.
But no one has ever done more than glimpse it from a distance. It is said to be guarded by the ghost of the last king of Miscarcand.
Burd! Deploy the troops for battle!
Know this. Every Dark Brother and Sister is a child of Sithis. He whom we call Sithis has many other names. Chaos. Doom. Discord. Sithis is the Void.
We of the Dark Brotherhood serve the Night Mother, who is the bride of Sithis. The Night Mother rules her children with a terrible Black Hand.
The Black Hand is the ruling body of the Dark Brotherhood. It is made up of one Listener and Four Speakers. Four fingers and a thumb, if you will.
As a member of the Dark Brotherhood, you must abide by the Five Tenets. They are the laws that guide and protect us.
The Five Tenets are as follows:
Tenet 1: Never dishonor the Night Mother. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.
Tenet 2: Never betray the Dark Brotherhood or its secrets. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.
Tenet 3: Never disobey or refuse to carry out an order from a Dark Brotherhood superior. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.
Tenet 4: Never steal the possessions of a Dark Brother or Dark Sister. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.
Tenet 5: Never kill a Dark Brother or Dark Sister. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.
Thank you. I know that delay is dangerous, but it is all for naught if we lose the battle before you can recover the Great Sigil Stone.
As you wish. I will wait here while you prepare yourself for battle.
So be it. Bruma's fate is in the hands of the gods now ... and yours.
There is no need for any formality at this time. I am not Emperor yet. And I am quite new to this notion of being heir to the throne.
Thank you for coming. I know I am asking for a great deal of trust. But this is the only way. I would not suggest it otherwise.
Your champion has already explained the situation to me. I have agreed to it. We will not win this war through caution.
You have a rare gift, to know when desperation is the path of wisdom. I will do everything in my power to defend your city, my Lady.
If Bruma falls, the Empire falls with us. So be it.
You avoid answering my question ...
Very well. Don't think I doubt you. The rulers of Bruma have long had dealings with Cloud Ruler Temple. We know whom they serve.
I will meet Martin at the Chapel. When all is ready, I will order my men to stop closing the Gates and prepare for battle.
This is the only way to stop this invasion from Oblivion?
I must confess, you are the first person to speak of victory against these daedra.
This war has seemed hopeless to me, but what else was there to do but hold on and wait for a hero to arise to save us?
And now it seems there is an heir to the throne after all, hidden at Cloud Ruler Temple... and perhaps a hero as well?
Martin has made his decision. The Blades stand beside him.
We must allow the Mythic Dawn to proceed with their plan to open three lesser Gates outside Bruma.
According to the plans you captured from those spies, they need three lesser Gates open before they can open a Great Gate.
The Great Gate will allow them to bring out the siege machine to blast the walls of Bruma, just like at Kvatch.
But it's our only hope to get the Great Sigil Stone we need to complete the ritual. You'll have to act swiftly when the Great Gate opens.
A desperate plan indeed. This ... Prince? Emperor? Martin would risk my whole city to gain a Great Sigil Stone?
Your plan is madness. There must be another way for you to recover the Amulet without risking Bruma's destruction.
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's go!
Stay focused! Watch your backs, and be careful. Antus, are you ready?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Do you have a death wish? Trust me, you don't want to try that again.
That's not smart.
You're lucky I like you. Otherwise you'd be dead already.
I won't beg you, but I ask that you please reconsider. My boys need another steady hand at their side, else they may not survive.
Somehow I knew you'd do the right thing.
I'm supposed to meet them at Weynon Priory. You'd best get whatever supplies you need now, so you can get there in time.
I... I need a drink to calm my nerves. Please, excuse me.
Splendid. You need to go to the city of Skingrad, to the large house known as Summitmist Manor. There you will meet up with five very unlucky guests.
In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you commiting murder, the bonus is forfeit.
The guests believe there is a chest of gold hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it.
In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools.
There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects.
When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave. Now go, see the doorman at Summitmist Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun.
All right. But don't take too long. The other guests are already assembled, and they're waiting on you.
Yes, well... Anyway... Now that we're all here, I guess we can start looking. I'd wish you good luck, but I wouldn't really mean it.
Oh, you poor dear! Well, this does make things difficult for me. I want to find the gold as much as anyone, but you need it so much more than I do!
Hahaha! Oh, you're a funny one! Good, I'm glad one of us has a sense of humor about all of this. It will make our time here that much more enjoyable.
I'm finally getting around to reading "Five Songs of King Wulfharth." I just wish I had more time to read it.
I was given "The Legendary Scourge." I don't know what to think about it yet.
I've never read that. Been meaning to pick it up, though. Perhaps I can read it when you're finished.
I've been trying to get through "Mysterious Akavir." It's a fairly interesting read.
I've been reading "Fundaments of Alchemy." I figure it can't hurt to learn something new.
That sounds interesting. Perhaps I'll have to read it as well.
I've not read that yet. It's a shame there isn't more time to spend with good books.
I've been reading "Overview of Gods and Worship." I'm not sure if I like it yet.
I read "The Real Barenziah" recently. Quite a piece of work.
I believe I read that some time ago. I'll have to give it another read.
I picked up "Frontier, Conquest." Haven't read much, though.
I found "Istunond�'s Cosmology" at the bookseller's. Haven't had a chance to read much, though.
Ah... an excellent read, though it's been a while since I've read it myself. Let me know how you like it.
I've been trying to finish "Brief History of the Empire." It's a lot to take in.
A friend gave me "The Book of Daedra." It's an interesting study.
Hmm... not my favorite work, but many enjoy it.
No, I haven't. I've heard that he really knows his way around, though.
I spoke to him recently. He really knows his way around. Knows every tree, rock, and cave in the area.
I don't see a problem with those two. It's a bit odd, but that's their business.
It is awful. Her poor mother. What is Glistel thinking?
I've never run into her there, but I can't blame her for enjoying the matches. Almost everyone likes them.
Have I seen her there? Of course! She certainly loves a good fight.
I was in there just a few days ago. Rasheda's prices are very reasonable.
I haven't been in a while, but it's always nice to stop in and chat with Rasheda. Plus, she always gives a better deal to her friends.
Odd noises? No, I haven't. That sounds a bit troublesome.
I thought I heard something the other night. It's none of my business, though.
Odd folks, the way they dote on those dogs. They're not hurting anyone, though, so it's no concern of mine.
I've seen them. Everyone likes a good dog, but they're an odd couple.
I've made some bets. Won some, lost some.
Not much for wagering, myself. Of course, I always seem to lose....
I've made a few bets. Made some good money, actually!
I haven't done too much betting. Can't say I know enough about the folks fighting to make a smart wager.
Do I like the fights? Of course! Everyone likes the fights! The thrill of battle, the sting of defeat. A wonderful time.
Horrible things, those Arena matches. Simply bloodshed for the sake of bloodshed. Barbaric, I tell you.
I thought about it when I was younger, but it just wasn't for me.
I never really thought about it. They just didn't seem like the sort of folks I wanted to spend time with.
I've often thought about joining the Fighters Guild. I've heard you can make a good living there.
I've never really thought about it. I've heard the money is good, but that's a bit too much risk for me.
Well, of course. I mean, there's always something there I need. And Seed-Neeus gives a fair price.
I haven't needed anything there in a while. I'm sure I will soon, though.
Certainly I've spent time there. Talasma runs a good, quiet Inn.
I've had many meals at the Oak and Crosier. Sure, it may not be the best in all Cyrodiil, but it suits me fine.
I bought a fine mare from him once. A fine, fine animal.
I'm not much of a rider. I've heard others swear by his animals, though.
He did? Excellent. I wonder if he got "The Lusty Argonian Maid" in. I've been dying to read that.
New books? Who has the money to afford all those books? I know I don't.
All right, dearie, I understand. If you change your mind, just let me know.
Oh, wonderful! This is going to be such fun! So, any ideas where we should begin searching first?
He's young, well-educated and obviously full of himself. Not much different than any young nobleman, really.
That young man has more nobility in his pinky finger than you have in your entire body, you uncultured swine.
It's obvious that young Primo comes from wealth. A chest full of gold would be mere spending change for him.
Someone turns up dead and you have nothing better to do than pester me about that fine young man? How truly pathetic you are.
Primo is a young man of refinement. This murder must be quite a shock for him.
I worry about the boy. What if the killer is after money? Primo is quite wealthy. He could be the next victim!
Two people lie dead, and all you can do is question me about that sweet boy? I'm beginning to think something is seriously wrong with you.
The poor lad is handling all of this better than I expected. It's a testament to his noble bearing, I'm sure.
If I may confide in you, dear friend, I'm very worried about the poor boy. The trauma of murders... it could scar him for life! He deserves better.
You... you're trying to turn me against that sweet boy. Make me think he's the murderer! Get away from me, you fiend!
There are only three of us left. All those people... dead. And the killer had to be either Primo... or you!
Oh, my heavens! Primo must be the killer! I... I never thought it could be him. Please... please! You've got to protect me from him!
Leave me alone, you ghoul! Can't you see I'm mourning for that poor, sweet boy?
He was so young... so innocent. That boy was destined for greatness. Who could have done such a thing?
I just can't believe he's dead. He was like a young, beautiful prince. I hope whoever did this can live with themselves.
I'm sorry, but my feelings for Primo are really none of your concern.
He's very handsome. But please don't tell him I said so! Hehe!
It's pretty obvious that Primo comes from a wealthy family. He would never be interested in a girl like me, I'm afraid.
I do hope Primo and I can be, you know...friends. He's so handsome. And he lives a life I can only dream of. I can make him so happy in so many ways.
You can't possibly think that Primo had anything to do with the murder, do you? That's madness!
Primo seems kind of nice. I just can't imagine him killing anyone.
I... I rather like Primo. He's not like the other boys I've known. He has... class. He could never have killed anyone.
Don't try to turn me against Primo! For all I know, you could be the killer!
Two people lie dead. Primo could have done it, I know. He's young, and strong. Still, I don't want to believe that.
I know Primo could be the killer, but I just don't want to believe it's possible. If... if he likes me, he could take me away with him...
He can't be the killer! He can't! I won't believe it! Get away from me!
Please... No... Primo can't be the killer. But it's either him... or you...
Oh, Azura, no! It's Primo! He's the only one left! He killed them... killed them all! We have to protect ourselves! We have to kill him first!
Get away from me! You're the last person I want to talk to about Primo!
I... I wanted to get to know him. Be his friend. Maybe... maybe more. I can't believe he's gone.
Primo was my chance, do you understand me? He was wealthy! He could take me away someplace! Whoever did this will pay!
It's a regal name, from a rather regal family. Indeed, my father owns more property than the East Empire Company!
He's somewhere around here. Why don't you stop wasting my time and go ask him yourself.
Seems like a nice enough kid. A little too rich for his own good, maybe, but I've met worse.
Primo is young and rich. I can sense a good, decent person in there somewhere. He just has to get his priorities straight.
It's really none of your business what I think about him, now is it?
I can't imagine someone like Primo has seen much death and suffering. This murder must be quite a shock to him.
Whoever the killer is would have to be strong, and quick. Now, I'm not saying Primo is our murderer, but you have to admit it's at least possible.
I'm not sure if you're really concerned for the kid or trying to convince me he's a murderer. Either way, I ain't listenin'.
I'm not sure what to think of the kid anymore. All I know is that two of the guests have been murdered, and he's just dandy. Makes you wonder.
Let me ask you something, friend. Why is Primo even here? The rest of us need the money, but his family is wealthy beyond measure.
Maybe he was bored, or maybe he just wanted to do some slumming. Or maybe he's a trained assassin hired to kill us all, one by one.
Sound crazy? Well these are crazy times, my friend.
By Ysmir, you've got nerve! Three people are dead! What, are you trying to turn me against Primo now?
This is madness! There are now only three of us left -- myself, you and Primo. I know I'm not the killer, but what about Primo? What about you?
Besides you and me, he's the only one left! By Ysmir, that boy will pay for what he's done! Come, we must kill Primo before he kills us!
The lad's dead, you uncaring fool! Now get away from me before you join him!
That poor boy didn't deserve to die. He was rich! He had no business even being here, looking for treasure that might not even exist.
Primo being here made no sense. Whoever our host is, why would he invite someone who didn't even need the money?
It's as if we were invited for another reason altogether. Think about it. We're trapped in this house, with no way out. And now people start dying.
I think poor Primo was tricked, just like the rest of us. If we're not careful we'll end up dead too. You mark my words.
He's young, rich and handsome. Basically the complete opposite of you.
He's young, rich and handsome. That's way out of your league, tramp.
Primo's a blue blood, a noble through-and-through. He thinks he's better than most people, and in most cases he's right.
I'll confess that I have no idea why Primo is here. The kid's got more wealth than the rest of us combined. He sure doesn't need a chest of gold.
Maybe he's incredibly greedy, but I don't think so. My guess is that Primo is so bored he simply has nothing better to do.
I hope you're not suggesting that Primo is the murderer? I'm the trained investigator here. Just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way.
Well, when somebody gets murdered, everyone nearby could be considered a suspect. That includes young Primo.
To be honest, my instincts tell me the kid isn't the killer. Sure he's a bit obnoxious, but that doesn't make him capable of murder.
I don't really know what you're trying to accomplish, but questioning me about Primo with two people lying dead just makes me suspect you even more.
Primo may be young, but he's no fool. He knows that the murder of two innocent people doesn't bode well for his own safety.
Primo may be young, but he looks strong, and I'm sure he could handle himself in a fight. I think I'm going to enlist his help.
I'll talk to Primo, give him a bit of encouragement. If he and I are vigilant, we may prevent the killer from claiming another victim.
I've come across your kind before. People get murdered, and you ask questions. It's a sure sign of a killer with a guilty conscience. Watch yourself.
All right, I'll be honest. I'm not quite sure what to think about Primo anymore. My list of suspects is getting pretty damned small as it is.
It's all starting to make sense now. Primo didn't need the money. He has more than any of us. Enough, in fact, to give away an entire chest of gold!
That rich little bastard lured us all here by appealing to our greed! Don't you see? He considers us all low class, and wants us exterminated!
That high-born little worm won't get away with this! He'll pay with his life! Come on, you watch my back. I'm going to take Primo down!
He was a young man and now he's dead, slaughtered like a lamb. I've got my eyes on you, stranger. Don't you forget that.
I'm still putting the pieces together. Was Primo murdered for his money? Was it something about the chest of gold? I'm not sure yet, but I'm close.
Primo was a young man, strong and full of life. Surely he would have been able to defend himself against an attacker.
Oh, that man disgusts me! I find his entire manner offensive. Why, just before you got here he told the most off-color joke about an Argonian maid.
He's a Nord. Mead-swilling barbarians, all of them.
He reminds me of you. Uncultured, unwashed and generally uninteresting.
Even if I do think Nels is the killer, I wouldn't share my thoughts with the likes of you.
He's an obnoxious drunkard, I know, but I'm not sure if I see him as the murdering type.
You think Nels might be the killer? He plays the buffoon, but it could all be an act. He is a Nord, and they're such a savage, uncivilized people.
Why are you trying to turn me against the Nord? Maybe you did, and you're just trying to cover your tracks!
Well, the list of suspects is certainly getting smaller. I didn't think the swine had it in him, but now I'm not so sure.
Two people dead, yet Nels still lives? I don't think that's a coincidence. Nords are savages, born to kill. I just know he did it!
My feelings about the Nord are my own business! Leave me be!
You and Nels... both still alive. One of you is a cold-blooded killer! I... I never did trust that Nord....
Oh, please! Save me! Save me from that savage! He'll kill me and then feast on my flesh! That's what Nords do! Please, I don't want to die!
He was a buffoon, but I didn't wish him dead, you cold-hearted villain!
All right, so I didn't care much for the man. That doesn't mean I wanted him dead.
So, Nels is dead. I don't condone murder, of course, but I can't say he'll be missed. As a rule, I find Nords rather... vulgar.
It's none of your business how I feel about him.
I wonder what makes him so "Naughty"? He seems nice enough to me.
Every now and then he looks over at me and smiles. I think he's sweet on me. If Nels finds the gold, maybe he'll want some company.
So, you think Nels did it, do you? I would appreciate you keeping your opinions to yourself.
I don't know what to make of all this, but I'm not sure I see Nels as a murderer.
Do you think he could have done it? He comes across as something of a drunk, but you never can tell what someone is capable of.
Look, I don't know who is responsible for this madness, so stop trying to taint my opinion of Nels.
I just don't know what to make of Nels anymore. He plays the bumbling drunkard, but he could very well be the killer.
Can I be honest with you? Nels won't stop looking at me. At first I was flattered. But now he's scaring me! He could be the killer! I could be next!
Either you or Nels is the killer! I can't trust either of you, so just stay away from me!
Please, just leave me alone! Either you or Nels is a murderer. I just don't know who to trust anymore!
It's Nels! He's the murderer! We have to get him before he gets us! Do you understand what I'm saying? We have to kill Nels!
Don't you even care that Nels is dead? Maybe you killed him!
The way he looked at me. It was flattering at first, and then... oh, who could have done this? Why would anyone kill Nels?
To be honest, I started getting a bad feeling about Nels. But now he's dead! I... I should have gotten to know him better. Now it's too late.
He's a Nord. Even a complete idiot could see that. So what does that say about you?
There's something about Nels I can't quite place. He's not from money, that's obvious. But I don't think he's quite the buffoon he seems, either.
Nels is a drunk. He's doesn't even try to hide that fact. But what else is he? When the liquor has dried, what remains of the man?
I think Nels drinks to forget, maybe about some tragedy in his life. He plays the buffoon, but I sense a deep sadness in him.
Are you trying to insinuate that Nels might be the killer? Maybe I think you did it. After all, murder is a common crime of the... low-born.
Nels seems just as unnerved as the rest of us that someone has been killed, but he seems to find solace in a bottle.
Before the body turned up, I got the sense that Nels was a bit of a drunkard. But he seems truly unnerved now, and is drinking rather excessively.
Damn it man, two people are dead! Have you nothing better to do than question me about the Nord?
He's drinking even more than he was before. Is it because he's afraid, or feeling guilty?
To be honest, I'm not sure if I trust him. He's a hard drinker, but there's something more. Something in his eyes, hard and calculating.
You want me to think Nels is the killer, is that it? Maybe you did it, eh? Maybe you're just trying to turn me against him!
I just don't know what to think. I had my doubts about Nels, and he is still alive. Could it be true? Could he have killed all of them?
I was right about him! He's been doing it, he's the killer! My friend... you and I have to end this. We must kill Nels before he kills us!
He's dead, and one of us killed him. Maybe it was you, eh? Maybe he found the gold, and you murdered him for it!
Someone killed the man, but who? And for what reason? We may never know.
I was thinking, maybe Nels found the chest of gold, and one of the others killed him for it! We've got to be careful, my friend, or we could be next!
Ah, don't let the name fool you. I had a bit too much mead a few years back, and there was this tavern wench.... Anyway, just call me Nels.
Why don't you and that barbarian climb back under your rock.
Nels is a Nord, and like all Nords he's a lawless barbarian with no respect for authority.
Know what I think? I think that barbarian will do anything to get his hands on the chest of gold. His kind are greedy and vicious, all of them.
Trust me, I know. I was stationed at Fort Frostmoth for a few years, on the isle of Solstheim. Those Nords are a bunch of animal-worshipping savages.
They're all the same, full of mead and something to prove. We lost a lot of good men up there. A lot of good men.
Someone's been killed, and you know what my real problem is? Trying to decide who did it, you or that worthless Nord.
When people start turning up dead, it's usually a good idea to keep your eyes on any nearby Nords, if you understand what I'm saying.
Nords are raised to be cold-blooded killers. Don't take your eyes off Nels if you value your life. I'll bet anything he's our murderer.
Now this is interesting. Two people turn up dead, and you're more concerned with my feelings toward the Nord.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to turn me against him to cover your own tracks.
Two people are dead, and the only thing the Nord can do is dive into a bottle of beer. If you ask me it's all an act.
Nels killed those people and pretty soon he'll come for the rest of it. Don't you worry, when I gather more evidence, I'll take that scum down!
My friend, in talking to you, it's become clear what must be done. I have no doubts in my mind that Nels is the killer. We must take him down!
We've got to kill that cold-loving bastard before he turns on us! You cover me while I strike the killing blow!
That mead-swilling barbarian killed those two people, I'm sure of it! I don't have the proof just yet, but I'm watching him.
Don't you worry, my friend. Nels won't get away with this. Not on my watch.
I was positive he was the killer until you opened your mouth. Now I'm not so sure.
My gut instincts tell me Nels is the killer, but still I lack the proof I need to confront him. Maybe you can convince me I'm right.
Nels is dead. You know what that means? You've just shot to the top of my suspect list. You make one wrong move and I'll break you!
Can't say I'm sorry to see there's one less Nord in the world. Still, I don't appreciate someone getting murdered right under my nose.
The Nord has been murdered. Maybe I'll get lucky and the same thing will happen to you. Unless, of course, you're the one who did it....
One less Nord in the world is something I'd normally cheer about, but the fact that he was murdered by a fellow guest does put a damper on things.
That's right. It's a Breton name. I'll have you know the Petits are one of High Rock's oldest and most respected noble families.
She's all right, I guess. Not that it's any business of yours.
Well, I don't really know her, but she seems like a very respectable old lady.
Honestly? I don't think she likes me. It's because I'm a Dunmer. I heard her say something to Neville, and it wasn't very nice.
So what are you trying to tell me? That Matilde is the killer? Why are you trying to turn me against her?
Well, she does seem genuinely upset that someone's been killed. Not that I'm ruling her out as a suspect, mind you.
I don't trust that old hag. She pretends she likes you, and then stabs you in the back. Who knows. Maybe she'll REALLY stab you in the back.
Okay, so I don't like Matilde. What makes you think I like you any better?
Could it be possible? Could an old lady be a murderer? She'd have the stomach for it, of that I'm sure.
At first I thought she was just a cranky old crone. Now I'm beginning to think she's a cold-blooded killer.
So you're telling me I should believe you? That Matilde is the killer? Why should I trust you? Get away from me!
I have no doubt that Matilde is capable of murder. But what about you? You're as much suspect in my eyes as she is.
It's her, you understand me? It's Matilde! She's the killer! She's the one doing this! We've got to kill her first! Do you understand me?
I... I never trusted her. But I never wanted to see her dead. Have you no compassion at all?
It's hard to believe she's dead. Why would someone want to murder an old woman?
Good, I'm glad she's dead. I can tell you that because we're friends. Matilde didn't like me just because I'm a Dunmer. She got what she deserved.
The old woman? I'd put her in the same class as you, actually - a peasant.
The old woman? She's quite a pest, really. I think she's gotten it into her head that I need mothering, or something. She is sorely mistaken.
Apparently the poor old woman thinks she is from a well-to-do family. Truth is, I have servants with more nobility in their blood than her.
Is there something wrong with you? Someone has been murdered! My feelings about that old crone are hardly important right now!
Something tells me the murder of one of the guests isn't going to stop Matilde from searching for the money. She strikes me as the greedy type.
Now that someone's been killed, Matilde may be a little frightened for her own safety, but she's still more concerned with finding the hidden gold.
Matilde claims to be from one of High Rock's most distinguished noble families, but I have a feeling their fortune has long been squandered.
What are you doing? Trying to turn me against her? What's the matter, trying to cover your tracks?
She seems frightened, like the rest of us. I bet now she's regretting ever stepping foot in this house, gold or no.
The more people that drop dead, the more annoying Matilde becomes. She keeps watching over me like some kind of worried grandmother.
If the killer strikes again, maybe they'll do me a favor and take her out next.
What, are you telling me Matilde is the killer? I don't know what to believe! You just stay away from me!
At first I thought Matilde was just a cloying old hag, but now I realize she could be the killer!
It's her! Don't you see? She's the only one left! The only one left alive! We've got to get her before she can get us! Do you understand?
No, I didn't really care for her, you commoner scum, but I never wanted anything like this to happen to her!
The old woman is dead! Murdered! Cut down in this very house! But why? Did she find the gold, and someone wanted it for their own?
Between you and me, I think Matilde found the gold, and one of the others killed her for it! Maybe that means the rest of us are safe.
If that's the case then the killer got what he was after, and the rest of us needn't worry about our own safety.
I ain't got much to say about the old lady, and even if I did, I wouldn't say it to you.
Kind of stuck-up, that one. Right before you got here I told the funniest joke about an Argonian maid, and she didn't even crack a smile.
Heh, you should have seen the old biddy trying to talk to young Primo Antonius. She may be a noble, but he looked down on her like a scullery maid.
Can't this wait, huh? Someone's been murdered and I've got better things to do than gossip about an old woman.
The old biddy seems flustered about the murder, but who isn't, right?
It seems she's upset about the murder, but there's something else. It's almost like she's glad there's less competition for the gold. Greedy old bat.
Have you no compassion? There are two bloody corpses lying in this place, and all you can do is question me about that old woman?
She looks pretty shaken, doesn't she? I can't tell if it's genuine fear or just really good acting. She's as much a suspect as anyone, don't forget.
I'll be honest, friend. I don't know what to think about Matilde. Yeah, she seems frightened, but she's also still alive. Why wasn't she killed?
She may look old and weak, but that's never stopped a murderer before, has it? Don't doubt for a second that she couldn't be the killer.
What, you think the old woman is the killer, is that it? Is that what you'd have me believe? Trying to cover your tracks?
She's either a frightened old woman or a cold-blooded killer! I don't know whether I should comfort her or hit her over the head with a rock!
There are only three of us left! You and I are no killers, so that leaves the old woman! Don't be fooled by her appearance. Matilde is no weakling.
She killed the others in cold blood, and she'll try to kill us next! I'm not about to stand around waiting to die! We need to kill Matilde!
She's dead. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, now would you?
What kind of sick, demented person could cut down an old woman in cold blood? It proves that evil truly does exist in this world.
Some bloodthirsty monster killed that woman in cold blood. It's obvious to me one of the other guests killed her to eliminate the competition.
Assuming that's true, who's next? You? Me? We need to keep our eyes open, friend. And we'd do well not to trust the others.
What's your interest in the old woman? You'd do well to keep your questions to yourself.
Matilde seems like an upstanding citizen of the Empire. She respects the law and recognizes the Legion as Tamriel's greatest defense against evil.
If I may be honest, I feel a bit sorry for the old woman. She comes from a noble family, I'm sure, but seems a lot less well off than she should be.
She's upset, you idiot! Murder has that effect on people!
The poor woman's rather upset. Someone of her bearing isn't accustomed to the horror of murder.
She's afraid, and for good reason. If the killer strikes again, they may very well pick an easy target, like Matilde. She needn't worry, though.
I'm a trained soldier with over twenty years experience dealing with situations like this. On my honor, this killer will be caught and dealt with!
Excuse me? You want to question me about Matilde? Two people have been murdered, you fool! Get your priorities straight!
Matilde is old, and frail. The shock of two people being murdered is surely too much for the poor woman.
There's a killer in here and Matilde needs protection. Who better to defend her but me? I'm keeping my eye on the old woman, don't you worry.
I suppose you're trying to turn me against Matilde, eh? Make me think she's the killer. I've got news for you friend -- I know it's you!
I can't prove it yet, but just you wait. You try to hurt that poor old woman and I'll cut you in two!
Three people have been killed, and now Matilde thinks she's next. I guess only the killer knows for sure. Isn't that right?
Three people have been killed, and the only ones left are you, me and a little old lady. One of us is a murderer, and my money's on the old lady.
Don't let her looks deceive you, friend. I've seen black widows like her before! Her crimes must not go unpunished! Justice is at hand!
Someone slaughtered that poor old woman like a lamb. I've got my eyes on you. Make one false move and I'll come down on you like a hammer.
How could this happen? How could I have let my guard down. That poor old woman is dead, and I should have protected her....
Matilde's murder saddens me friend, but not for the reason you may think. Ten years ago, when I was in my prime, this never would have happened.
But now I'm old, and my instincts have failed. I let that woman down.
The little Dark Elf? She seems a nice enough girl. But to be perfectly honest, I've never trusted their kind.
What about her? She's a Dark Elf, and that's bad enough. I may even like her less than you, if that's possible.
Personally, I think she's a little floozy. She's been eyeing young Primo Antonius, probably smells his wealth.
Someone has been brutally murdered, yet you want to question me about that little Dark Elf tramp? Go away, you fool.
If you ask me, the Dark Elf is our killer. They're an evil and vengeful people, all of them.
That little tramp is as guilty as sin, you hear me? She's the killer, and if we don't keep our eyes on her she'll do it again!
She's a Dark Elf and a harlot, and for all I know she's a murderer too! Now leave me be, you cretin!
Isn't it obvious? Two of us have been murdered in cold blood, and that little tramp hasn't batted an eyelash. You figure it out.
Don't trust her, sweetie. Not a thing she says. If she tries to get you alone anywhere, get away as fast as you can! She's a cold-blooded killer!
You bloody half-wit! Do I have to spell it out for you? She's a killer! A murderer!
I knew it! It's her! That Dark Elf tramp killed them all! We've got to get out of this place!
It's up to us now, don't you see? Dovesi did it! She murdered everyone! And now she wants to murder us too! We have to get her first!
So she's dead. What do you want from me? Flowers? A eulogy? I think not.
Yes, the poor girl is dead. What a shame. Well, I guess she won't be finding the gold, hmm? Hehehehehe.
One less Dark Elf in the world. And now there's one less person to find the gold, as well. It's a good day, don't you think?
Not much to tell about me, really. I'm from Morrowind originally, but my family moved to Valenwood a few years ago.
My feelings toward her are really none of your business.
She's quite beautiful, isn't she? A little young, perhaps, and not exactly high-born, but she possesses a unique elegance.
Can I be honest with you, my friend? I find Dovesi... captivating. She possesses a beauty beyond compare.
Maybe you could do me a favor? If you speak with her, put in a good word for me, would you? I would be forever in your debt.
Do my ears deceive me, or are you actually suggesting Dovesi might be the one behind the murder? Back away now, cretin.
She seems very upset by the murder. I do hope she'll be all right.
I can tell the murder is weighing heavily on her heart. She seems such a paradox to me. So gentle and beautiful, yet so strong...
She's upset, you bufoon, just like the rest of us! Two people have been murdered! I hope you're not suggesting she could be the killer!
The poor girl! She's too young, too innocent to be exposed to these horrible murders. I hope she's holding up all right.
I don't mean to sound like a ghoul, but with two people murdered and Dovesi obviously upset, this may be my chance to get close to her.
You know, offer her comfort and support during this difficult time. Besides, I want to watch over her, make sure she stays safe.
You fiend! Are you suggesting Dovesi is the murderer? You'd do well to watch your mouth, and your back!
Dovesi is young and weak, yet the killer left her alive. Why? She couldn't possibly have anything to do with the murders... could she?
How could I have been so naive, so stupid? We must stick together my friend, for Dovesi is surely the murderer! We must strike before she does!
You're not even worthy enough to mention her name, you low-born parasite. Now get away from me before YOU wind up dead!
She was so beautiful. And now she's gone...
Who? Who among us is vile enough to take the life of such a beautiful, precious creature? If I find out who did this, they will pay with their life!
To think, I actually had feelings for that wretched witch! Thank the gods she's dead. Now... Now we're safe. We are safe... aren't we?
She's an innocent young girl, and she doesn't need people like you asking questions about her.
Dovesi is a sweet young lass. She reminds me of someone I knew. But perhaps we should talk about something else.
Let me confide something in you, my friend. Dovesi is the spitting image of my own daughter! Her skin is darker, of course, but that sweet face...
My daughter was killed, you see. A few years back, by bandits. I'm sorry, please forgive a father's heavy heart.
You want to talk to me about Dovesi? Someone's been murdered, you idiot! There are more important matters to discuss right now!
The poor lass looks upset. But if she's anything like my daughter, she's tougher than she looks. She'll be all right.
Let me tell you something. If anyone thinks they're going to hurt that poor Dark Elf girl, they're going to have to get through me first.
Two people are dead, you pathetic little worm. Take your gossip mongering someplace else.
She's frightened, of course. No one that young should be exposed to such horrors.
So far the killer has claimed two victims. If they plan on adding Dovesi to that list, they can think again. I won't let any harm come to that girl.
Only three of us left, and one of us is a murderer. Do you expect me to believe it's that sweet girl? You murdering scum! I'll kill you!
She's afraid for her life, as we should be! There's someone else in this house, my friend. Someone hiding somewhere, killing us off one by one!
I swear to you, my friend, if anyone tries to harm that sweet girl I will tear them limb from limb! Whoever killed the others will strike again.
They're getting into this house somehow, which means there must be a way out as well! We need to find the secret exit and escape this madhouse!
Who could have done this? Who could have killed a sweet, innocent girl? Was it you? So help me, if I find out you're the one who did this....
I..I can't believe she's dead. Seeing her body lying there.... It's like my poor daughter all over again.
No... no! When I looked into Dovesi's face it was like peering at my own daughter. I... I feel like I've lost her all over again.
She's a Dark Elf. What, you blind as well as dumb?
Dovesi is a Dark Elf. They call themselves Dunmer. When I was young, I spent some time stationed at Fort Moonmoth on their homeland of Morrowind.
I have a great respect for the Dunmer people. They are strong and noble, and generally understand the importance of law and discipline.
Unfortunately, Dovesi doesn't seem to like me very much. But I don't blame her. The young ones tend to have problems with authority figures.
Ah yes, Dovesi Dran. She's a Dark Elf, originally from Morrowind, or so I hear. I get the sense she doesn't like me very much.
I'm not sure I like your line of questioning, friend. Someone's been killed. Show a little respect.
Dovesi's upset by the murder but she'll be okay. I get the sense she's seen worse things in her life.
Right now my main concern is figuring out who the killer is. She may be young, but Dovesi is a suspect just like everyone else.
I've seen enough in my time to know that anyone is capable of murder if they have the right motivation.
Why are you so concerned with my feelings toward a young Dark Elf girl? You wouldn't be so stupid as to try and turn me against her...
The girl's either upset that those people were killed or she's an excellent actress. She's still a suspect as far as I'm concerned.
You want my honest opinion? I think Nels is the killer. But I haven't yet ruled out that Dovesi may be working with him.
You want to know the truth? I thought for sure Nels was the killer. But with him dead, my bets are now on Dovesi.
I find it odd that so many people have been killed, yet the two of you still live. Looks to me like you two are working together.
So, three of us left -- you, Dovesi and myself. The list of suspects is certainly getting smaller. With Nels dead, my eye is on Dovesi.
You've helped me come to my senses, friend. There's no time for evidence gathering, no time to collect proof! Dovesi is the murderer!
That little Dark Elf urchin killed three people in cold blood, and now she's going to try to kill us! We can't let that happen!
Follow me, my friend, and watch my back. Dovesi must be brought to justice, and I'm the one to do it! Let's go!
I would have sworn with my life that Nels was the killer, but now he's dead as well! Dovesi is now my top suspect.
She was a child, and some sick murdering dog struck her down in cold blood. I swear, if I find out you did this I'll kill you with my bare hands.
Dovesi couldn't have been any more than fifteen years old. What threat could she have posed? Why was she murdered? Damn it, I mean to find out!
I was in the Legion for a great many years, my friend. I saw a lot of horrible things, including the murders of children.
It made no sense then, it makes no sense now. But don't you worry. I vow to bring Dovesi's killer to justice!
She murdered all those innocent people, and I delivered justice, just like any Legion soldier would. I... I only did what I thought was right...
From what I gathered, he's a retired soldier. He's been all across the Empire fighting in various campaigns. Goodness, he's handsome....
What do you care? He seems like a very respectable person. That's more than I can say for you.
Well, if I can be perfectly honest with you, I find Neville quite attractive. Redguards are so... exotic. Don't you think?
What, you don't think Neville is the killer, do you? That's absurd! He's a gentleman and a retired soldier, not a murderer!
Neville used to be a soldier. I'm sticking close to him. He makes me feel safe.
Neville has a strong sense of justice, I can tell. If we find out who the killer is, he'll take care of things, if you know what I mean.
You're trying to turn me against him, aren't you? Just leave me alone!
I just don't know what to think anymore, or who to trust. Neville seems like such a decent man, but how can I know for sure?
Do... do you think he could have done it? I mean, he is a retired soldier. He's killed before. Oh, dear, this can't be happening!
You want me to mistrust him, don't you! You want to turn me against him! Maybe... maybe you're the murderer!
I'm no murderer, so that means it's either you or Neville. Just stay away from me! I don't trust either one of you!
I know you're no killer. That means it's Neville! Oh, I'm so frightened! Please protect me from him!
He's dead, and one of you killed him! I hate you all!
I... I can't believe he's dead. Such a strong, handsome man...
Why would one of us kill Neville? What if they try to get the rest of us? You'll protect me, won't you?
I really don't know anything about him, so you'd be better off asking someone else.
He's a very serious man, but I guess that's normal for a retired soldier.
I know he's a retired soldier. But not just a soldier -- he was an officer in the Imperial Legion. I hate the Legion and everything it stands for.
When those soldiers came to Morrowind, they persecuted my people and stole our lands.
Neville may not be in the Legion anymore, but who knows what atrocities he committed.
I'm sorry, but someone has been murdered! I really don't want to talk about Neville right now.
Does being a soldier make him a good person? Does it make him above murder? I hardly think so.
I heard the others talking. Neville was a soldier for twenty years. He's used to killing, if you know what I'm saying.
Two people are dead. Could he really have done it? I... I just don't know...
Two people have been murdered, and neither of them was Neville. Watch your back around him.
Neville is a trained killer! That fascist pig killed those people, I just know it!
He's the killer, you idiot! Can't you see? He murdered all of those people!
He's the killer! Don't you see? We have to protect ourselves! We'll be next!
He killed them! All of those people! We... we have to get him before he gets us! We have to kill that murdering swine!
No, I didn't like the man. But why should you care? Please, just go away.
I... I don't understand. Who would kill him? And why? Is this about the gold?
All right, so I didn't like Neville. But the man was a trained soldier. He knew how to handle himself. Who could possibly have killed him?
Why don't you go ask him yourself? Or maybe you're afraid? You should be.
He reminds me of the guards under my father's employ. Strict, no-nonsense, and ready to fight at a moment's notice.
I know he's a retired Imperial Legion officer. Apparently, he's been in campaigns all across the Empire, from Skyrim to Morrowind.
I also get the sense that he's very eager to find the gold. I can't imagine his life of servitude to the Empire left him with much to retire on.
What are you getting at? Are you suggesting that Neville is the killer? Take your suspicions someplace else, you low-born worm.
He seems on edge, doesn't he? I guess you can take the man out of the Legion, but you can never take the Legion out of the man.
Neville seems different now that someone has been killed. More alert, more aware. Something tells me he's not going to take all of this lying down.
He's a trained soldier, after all. I bet if anyone can figure out what's going on here, it will be him.
Look, I don't know what kind of information you're after, but I won't help you. Just go away.
It seems that with each murder, Neville becomes that much more aware. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's planning on catching the killer himself.
Well, Neville is a trained soldier. He was in the Imperial Legion for twenty years, or so I've heard. He certainly knows how to kill.
Still, I don't think he's the murderer. No, quite the contrary. I think he takes the murders personally, feels he should have protected the victims.
What are you saying? That Neville is the killer? Why should I trust a low-born dog like you? Get away from me!
I... I thought he was hunting the killer. Now I don't know what to think! I don't trust him, or you! Stay away from me!
I was wrong! Don't you see? I thought Neville was trying to catch the killer! But he IS the killer! We need to find a way out of here!
He's dead, you peasant! There's nothing more to tell!
Neville was strong, a soldier. If he was murdered, this does not bode well for the rest of us!
My friend, I am truly worried! Neville was a strong and capable man, a soldier of twenty years! The rest of us will be easy prey for the killer now!
He's an Imperial Legion bulldog. Scum, if you ask me. Kind of like you.
Once an Imperial Legion bulldog, always an Imperial Legion bulldog. I've seen his kind before. He cares about laws and regulations... not people.
I will confide something in you, my friend. I despise Neville and all his Imperial Legion ilk! They are useless, uncaring tools of corruption!
Three years ago, my village in Skyrim was attacked by bandits. We went to the nearby Imperial Legion outpost, but they refused to help us!
My dear, sweet daughter Olga was killed that day. She was murdered, and the Legion would do nothing to help her. Neville and his kind are scum.
Right now I'm more concerned with the person who's been left for dead in this very house, not with that Legion dog.
He's like everyone else in the Imperial Legion. Someone needs help, someone is getting killed, and they're nowhere to be found. Worthless.
I really have to wonder where Neville was when someone was getting slaughtered just a few rooms away.
Maybe he was busy looking for the chest of gold. Or maybe he was right next to the victim, with his hand on the hilt of a dagger. Think about it.
By Ysmir's dragon blood, what's wrong with you? Two people are dead! It's hardly the time to chat about that Legion lackey!
Two of us killed, and where was the stalwart Legionnaire? That's what I'd like to know. He spent his life protecting the citizens of Tamriel? Ha!
With two of us now dead, it seems like the others are looking to Neville for protection. The fools! He'll kill them like he did the others!
That's right, I think Neville is the murderer. I can't prove it yet, but he'll slip up, just you wait. Whatever you do, don't turn your back on him.
Three guests have been slaughtered, and you want to ask me about that Legion dog? I don't know who I hate more, you or him!
Guests are dropping like flies around here, but not Neville, he's still in one piece. That tells me he's either very lucky, or a cold-blooded killer.
That sniveling Legion dog must die! Do you understand me? He's the murderer! He killed all those people! He must pay for what he's done!
The man is dead, you horse's ass! There's nothing more to tell!
I may not have liked the man, but I'm particularly troubled by his death. Neville was a capable fighter. Who could have killed him, and so quickly?
You want to know how I really feel about Neville's death? I'm afraid. I may hate the Imperial Legion, but its members are trained warriors.
Neville was probably the most capable fighter among us, yet he was cut down silently, just a few rooms away. I fear one of us is not who they appear.
This isn't the work of some greedy house guest. There's an assassin among us, you mark my words. We must watch ourselves at every step.
I'm a Redguard, though I've never actually been to Hammerfell. I was born here in Cyrodiil. My family has been in the Legion for three generations.
All right, that sounds like a fine idea! Oh, I just know you and I are going to find that gold! I have a sense about these things, you know.
Ooh, good idea! Maybe the chest is hidden under the floorboards! All right, I'll head down there and start looking.
That's fine. Make sure you have everything you need. There's no telling what you'll find there.
Farewell, my friend. Our fate is in your hands. Bring back the Amulet of Kings.
Brace yourself.
Very well, but do return quickly, I fear he's in more trouble than you realize.
Fantastic! Let's be off then.
Great. Whatever suits you and gets me Henantier back suits me just fine.
When you're ready to go and see him, let me know. But please, do hurry.
Well, Henantier's been warned that if he strays outside the Guild rules one more time, he may be up for summary dismissal.
The rules say that he isn't to practice dangerous experiments at his home. It must be done in the guild under the watchful eye of an associate.
Henantier's never been one for rules, and so he's continued to perform his latest experiments in secret. If word gets out, he'll be dismissed.
I have a weapon now... this hammer. Not my usual weapon choice, but it will have to do. Let us slay these creatures.
No more needed for me. I have this fine blade with which I'll slaughter some of these miserable beasts.
I know you were supposed to bring the weapons, but it seems you don't have them. Quickly, get those weapons to us!
Excellent! I long to sink a blade into some goblin flesh.
I'm good, I suppose. I've got this sword. It's better than nothing. Let's go bash in some goblin skulls!
I'm good. I've got this hammer... to bash in some goblin skull!
Good. I need a weapon. But it doesn't look like you have any! Go get them. And quick.
Good. I need a weapon. I'm looking forward to bashing some skulls in.
Good. Now everyone is armed. We're going to have to clear the goblins out of this place before the miners can return. Let's go.
Get the weapons to the other men. Then we'll take care of the goblins.
You've made it, and just in time. We've got trouble with goblins here... but where are the weapons? Get them and get back here! Quickly!
You've made it, and just in time. We've got trouble with goblins here. I'll take the bow. You give the weapons to my other two men.
If you're looking to join up, you should speak with Vilena Donton in Chorrol, Azzan in Anvil, or Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal.
I love being in the guild. There's money to be made. If you'd like to join up, let me know.
I am in Fighter's Guild.
See Azzan in Anvil or Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal for contracts.
See Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal for contracts.
See Azzan in Anvil for contracts.
The Fighters Guild is a brotherhood of warriors. We provide a service to Tamriel, lending steel and shield to those who need our help.
Whether that means ridding a town of an invading menace or protecting a helpless mage, we'll take the contract.
Oh no. What do we do? I'm so scared.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
When? I didn't know that! How can this be?
What! That really pisses me off!
my disp went down
Fabulous! That's great. Good for you!
My disp just went up
Thank you for your cooperation in this unfortunate matter, Your Grace.
Use your time well, to consider my Lord Sheogorath's merciful justice.
A prison cell is better than you deserve, mortal scum.
Let no one say Lord Sheogorath's justice is without mercy.
The coward's way out. So be it.
Serve your time peaceably, and pay your debt to society.
Hope you rot, criminal scum.
Then you leave me no choice. My duty to Lord Sheogorath requires me to use force.
You may rule Mania, but you will learn that Lord Sheogorath's justice still applies to you!
You're a fool as well as a criminal, it seems.
Then your blood stands forfeit for your crimes.
Then your punishment is death.
Dementia is not outside the reach of my Lord's justice, whatever you may think.
Then I have no choice but to use force. Our orders come from Lord Sheogorath himself.
I'll enjoy putting you down, scum.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Then we'll settle this the old way. With blood.
I'll make Captain for this!
Then pay with your blood!
Please come with me, Your Grace. According to the law, any stolen property must be handed over, then you're free to go.
Come with me. You'll be searched for stolen property, then released.
A coward as well as a criminal. Very well, perhaps I'll have a chance to test your mettle another day.
You'll come with me, and you'll be searched for stolen property and pay reparations. Then, you're free to go.
Here's the procedure. We go to the castle. First we search you, confiscate any stolen goods. Then you pay your fine, and we release you.
That's too bad. I was hoping you'd resist arrest.
Okay. Here's the procedure. We go to the castle. First we search you, confiscate any stolen goods. Then you pay your fine, and we release you.
Likewise!  I'm always glad to meet someone new.  Welcome!  I'm sure my mother would be glad to meet you as well.
Oh, well, I'm sorry for bothering you.  My mother often says I'm too forward with strangers.
That's right, my daughter Dar-Ma never came back from Hackdirt. I'm dreadfully worried something may have happened to her. Can you help?
Have you found her?  Is she safe?
Seed-Neeus is worried sick about her daughter Dar-Ma. If you think you can help, you'll find her at her shop, Northern Goods and Trade.
Yes, Seed-Neeus is worried sick about her.  I hope nothing has happened to her.  Sweet girl, but naive.
I heard some nice fellow found her held prisoner in some cave, and rescued her.  What a romantic story!
Yes, Seed-Neeus was so worried.  Nice to get a bit of good news for once, isn't it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Seed-Neeus must be devastated, poor dear.
These creatures kidnapped me from my room in the inn while I was sleeping.  I don't know why ... but I'd rather not find out!
A rather isolated village, south of Chorrol.  We do some business with the trader there.  Small volume, but she pays well.
Normally I make the deliveries, but I wasn't feeling well so Dar-Ma insisted on going this time.  I do hope nothing has happened to her!
Not a nice place to visit.  Those that remember still tell stories about the bad old days.
About thirty years back, there was some trouble out there.  Bad trouble.  Legion had to be called in, people killed.
Some say the Legion burned the town to the ground, but it's still there, for those that go looking for trouble.
Still folks living up there, but no one you'd like to meet after dark.
My grandfather built this place, not that it's any of your business.  We been down, but we got plans to bring back the good old days.  You'll see.
Outsiders came and burned our town, years ago.  Ruined us.  But we'll get ours back, one day soon.
We scrape by, not that we've ever had nought but trouble from outsiders like you.  You'd best be moving on, if you know what's good for you.
I was only a boy when the soldiers came. We hid, vowed revenge. But the Deep Ones never came back.
Etira, she's the one that found them old books. Learned the runes, how to speak to them again. But they want blood, she says, or they'll not help us.
We don't look kindly on strangers asking questions.  If you need a room, try Moslin's Inn.  Otherwise, you'd best be moving on.
I got nothing to say to you, stranger.  Outsiders have always tried to destroy us, but we've always survived.
Yes, a small village south of Chorrol.  Used to be a prosperous mining town, but it has been nearly deserted for years.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness!  She was supposed to make a delivery to Etira Moslin in Hackdirt, so I would start there.
In case it may be useful, she was with Blossom -- her horse, I mean.  Dar-Ma loves that animal, and would never willingly abandon her.
Ah well, never mind then.
So you found a book.  Someone must have left it.  What do I care?  No, I don't know what happened to her.  Why would I?
The best daughter a mother could ask for, kind-hearted and a friend to everyone she meets.
Ah, the comely Argonian lass.  You may have met her if you've ever been in her mother's shop, Northern Goods and Trade.
Oh, you meant the Argonian wench.  Must've slipped my mind.  Yeah, she was here.  Then she left.  I don't know nothin' else about it.
Uh, yeah, maybe I remember a young Argonian lass.  Sure, she stayed for a night and then she left.
Who?  Nah, I haven't seen any young women around.
Even if I had, why would I know anything about her goin' missing?  Not that I'm saying I ever seen her.  Cause I haven't.
I don't know any Dar-Ma.  If you're talking about that cursed Argonian swindler from Chorrol, I'd like to know where she is, too.
I already told you, she never showed up.
She never showed up.  How am I supposed to run a shop without any merchandise?  You tell her I want half off on my next delivery.
Shh. We can't talk here. They'll get suspicious. The girl is in danger.
Meet me tonight after dark in my house. I'll leave the door unlocked. Don't be late.
You have to believe me, I didn't know what they were planning.
They want to bring back the Deep Ones. I thought I did, too, but ... she's so innocent.
They've got her down in the caverns. They're going to sacrifice her, you understand? You've got to save her!
Here, take this key. It'll open any of the trapdoors down to the caves. Every house in town has one.
The one in Moslin's Inn is your best bet. Nearest where she's being held. The middle of the night, when everyone's at the Gathering.
Good luck. You will save her won't you? I gotta go now.
Dar-Ma is the daugher of Seed-Neeus, the owner of Northern Goods and Trade.  You'll often find her out taking the air near the Great Oak.
How would I know?  Maybe she went crazy and run off into the woods.  Now if you'll excuse me, I got things to do.
That's my horse.  Owned it for years.  Now either buy something or get out.
Thank you!  Hurry, we need to get out of here, quick!
Thank you!  You're the first friendly face I've seen since I arrived in this hellhole.
I know you'll do your best, but... please... if I don't make it, at least bring the news to my mother, Seed-Neeus, in Chorrol.  Let's go!
What are you doing?  You can't leave me here to die!
Nice pick. the 2nd one is a long choice,  You should have the topics back again.
You should only have goodbye as your option.
Tierra, get these civilians to the camp south of the city immediately, and then report back here at once!
One day, you'll find out who the Brethren are, and you'll be sorry.  Oh yes.
Brethren?  I got no brothers.
That's none of your concern, outsider.
Don't push your luck, stranger.  Plenty of folks have turned up dead after asking questions like that.
Those of us who've changed the most, we call The Brethren. Live down in the caves, to be nearer the Deep Ones.
They don't like the sunlight much. Dangerous, too. You'll want to avoid them if you can help it.
You'd be better off not asking such questions around here.
Thank you for rescuing me!  My mother will be so pleased when we arrive back in Chorrol safe and sound.  Let's go!
Thank you for your help!  If you are ever in Chorrol, please look me up. My mother owns the Northern Goods and Trade shop.
Thank you, thank you!  I can never repay you for your gift of my daughter's life, but you have my friendship and gratitude to the end of my days.
Oh, no.  I had feared she might never return, but I had hoped for the best ... I ... thank you for your efforts ... please, excuse me ...
Oh, all right. Very well then. If... um... if you need anything, please just ask. I'll be happy to take your bet if you change your mind.
Ah, excellent! I knew you were the gambling type! Well, you can bet on the Yellow Team or the Blue Team.
The teams are evenly matched, so you've pretty much got a 50/50 chance of winning. So, which team would you like to bet on?
The blade has been coated with a rare poison called Languorwine. One drop in a normal human bloodstream will mimic the effects of death immediately.
I have provided you with a vial of antidote, which will be used to revive Francois Motierre after you successfully stage his death.
You should also know that there's only enough Languorwine on the blade for this one contract. After Motierre is sliced, the knife will be useless.
I can't recall, ever loving moments, like this moment, with you.
It's a pleasure to be here with you.
What next friend?
Ok, I feel normal.
You're pissing me off, what next?
You are indeed...a bastard.
my current disp is 100
my current disp is big fat zero.
my current disp is between 30 and 70.
my current disp is 70 or higher
my current disp is 30 or lower
My mother owns this shop.  She would be glad of your business.
My mother owns Northern Goods and Trade in Chorrol.
Sounds good.  I'm right behind you.
Fine, but don't be gone too long.
It doesn't seem you have a sword, or any of the weapons for us. Please, get those weapons as soon as possible.
A sword would be wonderful. Unfortunately, it appears you don't have one. It looks like you have a hammer, though.
A blade. Fantastic! Let us take the fight to these vile creatures.
A sword isn't the worst thing in the world. Too bad you don't have one! Come back when you have a weapon for me!
A sword? You don't even have one!
A sword, huh? Hmm... good enough for me. I'll split scalps instead of bash skulls.
It doesn't seem you have a hammer, or any of the weapons for us. Please, get those weapons as soon as possible.
Ah... a hammer. Well, it seems you don't have one. However I see that you have a longsword....
Ah... a hammer. Well. Not my first choice, but it will suffice. Let's go!
I'd love a hammer. Too bad you don't have one! Come back when you have a weapon for me!
I'd love a hammer. Too bad you don't have one!
A hammer! Excellent! Good for bashing in puny goblin skulls!
Thank you...thank you so much. I can't tell you how grateful I am. You always have a home here at the Grey Mare.
You've spoken to him by now, haven't you?
Have you spoken with him already? Please, say you have.
I knew it! I knew a man like Bittneld wouldn't be interested in those other women!
Ha! They parade around in their fancy clothes and their expensive perfumes. What do they know? All fluff and no fiber. That's what I say.
But...what if we're wrong? Bittneld has traveled the world, while I've spent my whole life in this tavern.
No matter. Will you ask him to visit me? I would be most grateful.
You've spoken with him? Really? What did he say? I beg you, tell me.
You haven't? Why not? Is this just a game to you?
I'm sorry. Please. Just come back to me when you've spoken to Bittneld.
Then why do you waste my time? Begone, I have no more patience for you today.
Well then, you must excuse me. I have important business to attend to.
Yes, yes! This is indeed the Honorblade of Chorrol, finally delivered back to us after all these years!
So this tale has a happy ending after all, at least for you. Money cannot buy happiness, they say, but we know better.
This is incredible! I never thought to see this sword again! How did you ... never mind, one should not look a gift horse in the mouth.
Please accept my thanks on behalf of the people of Chorrol, for restoring this sword and the honor of our city.
As a token of our gratitude, I bestow upon you a symbol of honor and heroism, the Escutcheon of Chorrol.
You've done a great service to Chorrol, and you should be proud.
You have it? Let me see it!
I do not care to describe it. You will know it when you see it, I think. It is not something one of the ogres should have in his possession.
Many years ago, when the Count was still alive, a daring thief stole the ancient Honorblade of Chorrol from out of this castle. Why?
Indeed. What is the point of my tale? Albert Jemane builds Weatherleah way out in the middle of nowhere.
He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the Chorrol Guard's sight.
I believe that the item Albert stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at the Weatherleah settlement.
Unfortunately, the notorious Redguard Valley Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.
If you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it.
I can get you started by telling you where the Ogres live. The rest is up to you.
Suit yourself. I thought you might have an interest in self-improvement, but perhaps not. Let me know if you ever change your mind.
Excellent. Curiosity should never be denied, is it not so? And who knows, my story may prove profitable to both of us once it has come to its end.
My tale actually begins with the father, Albert Jemane. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization.
He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly.
He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.
He fled from Chorrol with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son Reynald was found, wandering alone in the wilderness.
Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family.
Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.
Bah. I was a fool to have trusted you in the first place. Get out of my sight.
Of course you will. Do whatever you must; I require that book as soon as possible.
You gave HIM the book? What were you thinking? And here I thought one of you Guild mages might actually have a brain...
All right, all right. We can deal with this. You'll have to get it back, that's all.
You're in the guild, aren't you? You should be able to walk right in, find it, and take it. And if you can't, then break in. I want that book.
Bring it to me once you have it. I'll even still give you the reward I promised, despite your incompetence. Now go!
You did WHAT?
Are you out of your mind? Did I not make it clear that Teekeeus was the one person I NEVER wanted to acquire that book?
I can't believe you could be so stupid...
All right. No need to get angry, I suppose. It's a small problem, but one that you can resolve.
You'll just have to get the book back, that's all. Whatever it takes, yes? If you need to break in and steal it, that's what you'll do.
At least, you will if you want your reward. Now get moving!
Hadn't you heard? He went crazy and killed Bernadette Peneles, poor girl.
It's unbelievable. Glarthir went after Toutius Sextius with an axe. Killed him before the guards could do anything. No one even knows why.
You must not have heard. He went crazy and killed Davide Surilie with an axe! Nobody can figure out why.
It's too bad nobody stopped Glarthir before he went on his killing spree. I guess no one knew how crazy he really was.
Did you hear? He went crazy and started attacking people with an axe! Luckily the guards stopped him before he killed anyone.
He turned up dead. I guess someone finally got tired of his crazy behavior.
The town eccentric. Lives in the big house on the corner, southwest of the Chapel. Don't worry, he's harmless.
I don't mean to gossip, but he is more than a bit strange.  However, he's always been tolerated as the town eccentric.
Thank you for warning me about him. Please, hurry and tell the guards before it's too late!
You did the right thing showing us that note. My brother and I will take care of him, don't worry.
You look concerned. Is there something you want to tell me about Glarthir?
Our neighbor. A bit eccentric. Why, is there something I should know?
Well, I know he's a bit odd, but I've always thought he was kind of sweet.  Lately, though, he has been stranger than usual.
I think maybe he's been following me.  I see him every morning on my way to Chapel.  I've tried to say hello but he always pretends not to hear me.
You may have heard that he's a bit touched in the head, and that may be true, but he's always been a quiet neighbor.  Never given us any trouble.
Sad story. But at least we stopped him in time, thanks to you.
Don't worry about him. We'll handle it.
How to say this nicely?  He's sort of the town eccentric.  Lived here for years, we've gotten used to his ways.
Although ... lately he's been weirder than usual.  Always looking over his shoulder, writing in his little notebook.  I wonder what he's up to now.
I'm sorry, but I don't think I know any Glarthir.  Wait, do you mean that strange Wood Elf that you see wandering around the city?
Yes, I've seen him, but never spoken to him.  He seems to be at the Low Gate every morning when I pass by on my way to the castle.
Gives me the strangest looks, now that you mention it.  Almost like he hates me, although I have no idea why.
I appreciate your warning. I'll be on the lookout for him. But please tell the guards so they can arrest him before he attacks me!
What of him?
Yes, the strange Wood Elf who haunts the Low Gate every morning, you said he was Glarthir.  I'm afraid I know nothing else about the fellow.
You have something you want to tell me about that nutcase?
Glarthir?  Total nutcase, if you ask me.  But he's never done anything -- yet -- that we could arrest him for.
He's a raving lunatic.  I'm assuming you're asking because he's done something strange.
Like what?  Oh, like shouting obscenties at you, or wearing only fur for an entire year, or waiting outside your house every morning.
Not that you'll get anyone else in town to admit it. "Oh, he's harmless, we're used to him." Harmless, ha!  One day he'll snap. Then watch out.
Now that you mention it, yes.  You look up and find him across the street staring at you.  Creepy.
Oh, I don't know.  How could you tell, anyway?
Yes, I heard Bernadette Peneles say that she thought he was following her. It might finally be time to do something about that crazy Wood Elf.
I agree.  He's always writing in that little notebook.  Sometimes I think he's watching me!
Just have to take matters into my own hands. The only way now.
They think I don't know. They think I don't see.
I'll show them. I'll make them pay.
They gave me no choice. I'm not a violent person, but I can only be pushed so far.
It must be the Maruhkati Selectives. All the evidence points to them.
Could be the Blades. They've always feared me.
Maybe the Mythic Dawn, or the Ayleid Revivalists?
My enemies think I'm weak. That I'll never act.
Psst.  Over here!
Over here!
Yes, you. We need to talk.
I ran into some goblins in the woods not long ago. Nasty little beasts.
I heard there were some goblins around here recently. Awful creatures.
I heard people saying they ran into goblins around here not long ago. I can't stand those things.
I saw a mudcrab a couple of days ago. Ugly little animals.
I ran across a couple of mudcrabs not long ago. Annoying creatures.
I saw some mudcrabs by the water recently. I steered clear of them.
Disgusting creatures. I hope to never see another.
Horrid beasts. I hate the things.
I can't stand the sight of those creatures.
I avoid those things whenever I can. Horrible creatures.
Nasty creatures, but I hear their meat is rather tasty.
Ugly things, with their thick shells and sharp claws. I avoid them.
Well, at least they're slow, and not too bright. Their pincers are sharp, though.
Goblins. Ugh. Evil, foul-smelling little brutes.
Horrible things. I hear that the High Elves train them. I can't imagine it.
Terrible creatures. They travel in packs, and they're always up to no good.
[CLEARS THROAT]
[YAWN]
[SNORT]
[SNIFF]
[COUGH]
[SIGH]
Horrible creatures! Replete with horror and evil. They roam freely eastward of the estate. I look forward to you exterminizing them.
I hope the Guard can hold off the daedra, but you think about what happened to Kvatch, and you can't help but worry.
Our Countess will never let Chorrol fall to the daedra! Oblivion Gates be damned!
It's good that you've joined one of our local organizations. It helps you make the right connections.
If you're thinking of making Chorrol your home, you should join a guild. It's hard work, but steady money. And people get to know you.
I'm not from Chorrol. I'm afraid I can't tell you anything at all about the town.
If I don't have what you need, you might try the other Chorrol merchants. Renoit's has books. Fire and Steel for your armor and weapons.
We are from Chorrol.
Did you hear about Reynald Jemane's long lost twin brother returning to Chorrol?
Now I hear there's a stranger in town asking about them. A Dark Elf, from back east they say. I wonder what he wants.
You need a place to sleep in Chorrol? Well, why don't you just join the Fighters Guild, or Mages Guild? Sleep for free around Cyrodiil!
You can PAY for a bed at the Grey Mare or the Oak and Crosier. But if you get a bed for free at a guild, why would you pay for one?
I'm sorry. I'm new in town, and don't know anyone.
Those Odiil boys ought to know better. Leave troubles like that to the town guard. That's what they're paid for.
Odiil boys say creatures of some sort are attacking their farm. Went off on their own to stop them. Poor father's worried sick.
In Chorrol, we Highlanders treat our Gods' teachings as rules to live by. Our lives are governed by the Ten Commands.
My housemate, Malintus Ancus, and I are well-known in certain circles here. But, you don't travel in those circles, do you?
The deer here are skittish. Need to get them quick, or they'll lead you a merry chase. Poison on your arrows can help, and it won't hurt the meat.
I have warned my people to stay inside the walls and put my guard on full alert. There's nothing else we can do.
No worries. Whatever happened at Kvatch won't happen here.
Glistel and me, we keep an eye on things here in Chorrol for certain interested parties... as a public service, like.
Rena and I moved to Chorrol so we could have a nice, comfortable home for our dogs. It's a lovely town. And our dogs are so happy here.
They probably call us 'the Dog People' here in town. Rimalus and I love dogs. We have quite a few. So sweet and well-behaved, you wouldn't believe.
Smart thing is to join a guild. Any guild. Gets you a place to sleep for free.  No muss, no fuss, no crummy tavern food and lice-ridden beds.
I hear that Emfrid and Captain Bittneld are spending a lot of time together. You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?
Who is the fairest of them all? Other than myself? The proprietor of the Grey Mare is lovely. She and the guard captain would be a nice couple....
We're a mountain people, tough, independent. County Chorrol is rich in mines and timber, wool and mutton, and hard-working people.
Did you ever meet Dar-Ma? Young Argonian lass, popular around town. She's disappeared, and her mother is worried sick about it.
The Oak and Crosier is the place of choice for well-bred visitors to Chorrol. The Grey Mare is more suitable for... others.
Just between the two of us, I wish the Countess would worry a bit more about the security of the city and a bit less about her damned painting.
Valus Odiil is down at the Grey Mare, and he seems upset. His boys are in some sort of trouble
Seems like you could handle trouble pretty well. Would you go see what's the matter?
Maybe you haven't heard, but Seed-Neeus's daughter has disappeared. Very sad.
Chorrol's got plenty to eat, and good, thick walls, and that suits me fine. I don't know what's going on out there in the woods, and I don't need to.
There are a lot of fine-looking women in Chorrol. But they're all... kind of snooty. And not very nice.
In Chorrol, we don't think much about what goes on in the Imperial Palace. But these murders... the emperor and all his sons dead... what's next?
Do you know Reynald Jemane, the fellow who lives on the west side of Chorrol?
I saw him in Cheydinhal recently, and said 'Hi,' and he pretended he didn't know me.
I was quite irritated, and haven't spoken to him since.
But, I wonder, was he really trying to be a fool? Or was something wrong?
Yeah. I used to be Fighters Guild here in Chorrol, but I done some incarceration for Trespassing and Theft. Couple of times.
You know, they kick you out of the guild if you get caught doing some incarceration. How many? I forget. But I did a lot.
I've never been here before. And I won't be back, unless the boss wants me here.
Dogs are an orc's best friend. Good protection, good companions, good eats. The Bruiants have dogs. Lots of 'em.
We're simple, Gods-fearing folk here in County Chorrol. Easterners worship their wallets and their fat bellies.
Are you a student of the Arcane Arts? My husband, Alberic, is an Advanced Trainer in Conjuration at the Mages Guild.
Chorrol? That's where we are, right? Really? Great. I don't care. And I'm not interested. But it's sure nice of you to let me know.
Nice town. But you need money here to live well. Head out of town and do some hunting. Sell the skins. Or, you can loot old caves and ruins.
A Light Raiment, huh? You sure? I figured you for the Heavy Raiment type. You know, hide behind a skin of steel? Hmph. Okay then, here.
Put that on, see if it fits okay. When you're ready for a match, I'll be waiting. You want to fight, you talk to me. All right then.
Here. Wear it proudly. And keep it in good condition, would you? That way I can give it to some other suicidal idiot after you're dead.
Just let me know when you're ready for a match and we can get this over with.
You can't fight now! You have a bet down on an Arena match. Look, finish up with our gambling, and then you can fight.
So you're ready to fight the Gray Prince, are you? Well you can't go out there without a name. You know, an Arena name!
Something catchy, something the people of Cyrodiil will remember when they tell stories about your inglorious defeat! So, what's it going to be?
You'd damn well better be ready! You've got an Arena full of people and the Grand Champion himself waiting for you! Now get up there and fight!
You're ready to fight? Good, good! All right then, head up to the Arena and give the people a great show!
Yeah, I know, you already told me. That's why there's an Arena full of Spectators and some hungry creature that wants to make you its lunch!
We're just not ready! It takes time to find those beasties and get them back here alive. Remember, just one show a week. Come back some other day.
Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Boar, one Boar and one Wolf, or two Wolves and one Goblin Skirmisher?
Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Goblin Berserker, two Trolls, or two Goblin Berserkers and one Troll?
Based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Mountain Lion, two Mountain Lions, or two Mountain Lions and a Spriggan?
Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Bear, two Minotaurs, or one Bear and two Minotaurs?
Okay, based on your abilities, here are your choices. Do you want to fight one Ogre, two Ogres, or two Ogres and a Land Dreugh?
Looks like you've reached your peak. Tell you what, from here on in, you can fight one, two or three Minotaur Lords. So what's it going to be?
Listen, I can't let you fight in a match while you've got a bet down on another combatant. Put your gambling to bed, and then we'll talk!
Okay Brawler, you know the drill. Head up to that Arena and show 'em who's boss!
All right, this is it. Your last fight against the Yellow Team. I guess you could say they saved the best for last. The three best, actually.
You're up against a swordsman, an archer and a spellcaster. Two lower level combatants, plus that Yellow Team Champion you've seen down here.
You beat all three, and you get named Champion! I know you can do this! Now get up there and show everyone why you're the best!
Oh wait, there's one more thing! I sent Porkchop the boar up to the Arena to help you out. He'll at least keep one of them distracted! Now good luck!
You must be downright determined to get yourself killed, huh? Okay then, head back up to the Arena and try not to die before the gate opens.
Ha ha! Now that's the spirit! You give the people of Cyrodiil a good show, and I'll make sure you get a decent burial! Ha ha ha ha ha!
All right, Brawler, this next match is going to be a challenge. Turns out there are two Wood Elf sisters who always fight together.
They're twins, actually. You got to take 'em both out! Now get in there, and show those tree climbers who's boss!
Your next opponent is a Khajiit. Not one of the quick, jumpy ones either. This cat goes in heavy, usually with an axe! Now go get 'em!
This next opponent is a Redguard. I've seen him fight with both a mace and a sword, so be ready for either one.
Next up is a Dark Elf. I've never seen him fight before, but he's got a bow as well as a sword, so be ready for a ranged attack!
Don't be fooled by your next opponent. The little dagger he uses is actually a powerful enchanted weapon called Shimmerstrike. Now go get 'em!
No surprises with this next one, just a High Elf with a chip on her shoulder. Get up to that Arena and make her beg for death!
This next opponent is your standard axe-armed Orc. He's in a Heavy Raiment, and looks pretty fit. Nothin' you can't handle.
I've seen this next one fight before. She's a Nord, very quick, very strong. She favors a longsword and knows how to use it. Don't underestimate her.
Your next opponent is the most savage, blood-crazed Orc I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a lot of 'em! This will not be fun!
She'll come out of that gate with a warhammer the size of a child, and she'll swing it until your head explodes! Don't let that happen!
Listen up! This next match is an outrage, but there's nothin' I can do about it! You've got three opponents this time, and you have to beat them all!
They're Argonian prisoners, brought here from Black Marsh. They've been told they have to kill you in exchange for their freedom!
I don't know what crimes they commited, but it's your life or their freedom! The choice should be pretty clear! Get going, and watch yourself!
After that last match, this one should feel like a vacation. One Khajiit in a Heavy Raiment, probably with a sword. Nothin' you can't handle.
This next one's a Breton. He looks like a bit of a dandy, but he's deadly with a blade. He has more experience than you, so be prepared.
The first Yellow Team Hero you'll face is an Imperial in Heavy Raiment. He fights with an Akaviri longsword.
Thing is, this guy used to be a Blade. You know, those guys who protect the Emperor? He's a trained swordsman, so keep your damn head down!
Okay, Hero. This next opponent is a High Elf wizard, a master in the school of Destruction. But wait, it gets worse...
He also uses an enchanted shield called the Gray Aegis, which gives him some serious magic resistances. Your best bet is to just charge straight in!
Press the attack, and don't give him a chance to let off a spell! I don't want to have to sweep your ashes out of the Arena!
All right, maggot. Looks like you're suited up in your Battle Raiment and all set to go. The Red Room is just over there.
When you're ready to get eviscerated, just head up the ramp to the Arena. Good luck, and may Azura have mercy on your soul.
Your next opponent wears a Heavy Raiment, but attacks with a short sword. She's like a heavily-armored wasp, and has the temper to match. Careful.
Ugh, spellcasters. That's what this next one is, a High Elf sorceress or something. Just get in close and stab her a few times, that'll teach her.
Ready? Ready for what? You're Grand Champion! You've already won it all! The whole damn thing! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ready? Ready for what? You're a champion now! The Grand Championship is the only thing left!
Ready? You call that ready? You're not even wearing your Battle Raiment! Don't talk to me again until you're suited up, you disrespectful maggot!
I know you're ready! I already approved your match, you idiot! Now get up to that Arena and spill some blood!
You're a Bloodletter now, so your opponents aren't gonna hold back anymore! This is the real deal! Get into that Arena and make the Yellow Team pay!
The match is all set, my friend! Now get up to that Arena and teach those Yellow Team maggots some manners!
Um... You're not wearing your Battle Raiment... You all right? You haven't taken too many blows to the head, have you?
I know, I know! Sometimes I wish we'd run the matches through the night, too! But the Yellow Team needs their beauty sleep! Ha ha ha ha!
You might be ready, but the Arena ain't. Matches take place between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Come back later, moron.
Okay, listen up. There are no disqualifications in a Grand Champion match. That means you can wear whatever armor you damn well please.
Agronak will be wearing his Raiment of Valor, and he's probably got it heavily enchanted, so feel free to do the same to any armor you have.
Now, as you know, in any standard Arena match you're forbidden from looting the corpse of a fallen opponent. Well this ain't any standard match.
In the event that you beat the Gray Prince, you're to remove his armor and present it to me. Then you'll get your own Raiment of Valor.
Look, these aren't your average Arena matches. They're shows! You fighting some savage beasts! People come to see you kill things. It's simple.
We can do them any time of the day. You kidding? The citizens of the Imperial City would love some late-night entertainment!
You can wear whatever ever you want, of course. We don't want you getting killed out there!
You can only fight once a week, though. We'll need that much time to catch new creatures for you to fight against.
Oh, and don't worry. We'll try to match the creatures to your combat abilities, so the fights will always be more or less "fair." Sounds good, huh?
We'll do it like this. You can fight one, two, or three creatures. The more creatures you fight, the more you win. If you survive, that is! Ha ha ha!
You fight for the Blue Team. You fight against the Yellow Team. In order to fight in the Arena you must wear an Arena Battle Raiment.
The Battle Raiment covers your entire body. You can use your own helmet, shield, and weapon, so choose those items wisely.
The Battle Raiment's already enchanted, so you can't muck with it. But aside from that, anything goes. Magic, stealth... whatever you need to win.
You can compete in the Arena any day from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Just come to me, tell me you're ready for a match, and away you'll go. Got it? Good.
If you actually manage to win a fight, don't get any ideas about looting your opponent's corpse! That's strictly forbidden!
You're damn right you will! This is a training hall, not a nursery! Now get back up those stairs while you still have legs! Damned tourists....
You what? You want to be a combatant? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you! My granny could beat you, and she's dead!
Wait, you're serious, aren't you? What is with you people? You walk in, want to be combatants, and your entrails end up decorating my Red Room.
All right. It's your funeral. Welcome to the Arena, you filthy Pit Dog. You're free to fight, so long as you know the rules of competition.
Now, let me give you your Battle Raiment. It's the uniform of all Arena combatants. Do you want a Light Raiment or a Heavy Raiment?
Yes, I've heard the Fighters Guild offers some wonderful opportunities.
Hmmm... I've never had much interest in the Fighters Guild.
Must we talk about the Fighters Guild now?
The Mages Guild is, indeed, a fine organization.
Yes, I've heard some of the finest mages in Tamriel belong to the Mages Guild.
I've never been that interested in the Mages Guild, myself.
Chorrol is a wonderful town.
I know Chorrol is the best town I've spent time in.
It's true. Chorrol has almost everything you could need.
Yes, Renoit does have a fine assortment of books.
I should visit Renoit's more often.
I've heard that Renoit has a good selection, and at reasonable prices.
I'm not much of a reader, myself.
I had heard he was looking for some help.
Yes. I like the Grey Mare as well.
It's a fine place.
It's true. Some fine horses he has.
I've heard he knows his way around.
People say he's very familiar with the area.
It is a nice place, and you're right about Talasma.
I've always liked the Oak and Crosier. I don't know Talasma that well, though.
I've always been happy with the weapons I've bought there.
Rasheda does a good job keeping Fire and Steel stocked with good weapons. Maybe not the best in Tamriel, but good.
Luckily, I haven't had to make use of their services. Still, it's good to know the Chapel is there.
It's a fine chapel. And a fine group of healers, as well.
Do you think? I've never noticed anything.
I've suspected that as well. Still, it's not a bad place.
Very true. You can find almost anything you need there.
I can't say I've done a lot of shopping there, but I've heard good things.
No question about it. And Seed-Neeus is an excellent proprietor.
Not a bad idea if you're looking for work.
Not me. I've got plenty to do at home.
I don't know much about the man, but I've heard he is an excellent warrior.
I haven't really spent any time around him. I find him a little frightening, actually.
I've heard there are good trainers there. Costs a bit of coin, though. I'd rather go out and practice on my own.
It's not always easy to find a good trainer. That's a good place to look.
I've heard good things about the mage trainers there.
I've never spent time at the Mages Guild. I've thought about it, though.
I haven't done much betting, but I hear some folks have made a good bit of money.
Hmmm... maybe I should start betting with Hundolin as well.
I like dogs, but it's a bit excessive with those two folks.
I've never been a huge dog lover myself, but some people really love them.
Can't say I've heard anything myself. Still, that's odd.
Strange noises, you say? How very odd. I haven't heard it myself.
Strange noises? They should have the guards look into that.
I've liked some of Scribonia's work. Haven't read everything, though.
I'd like to read Scribonia's work. I just wish I had more time to do it.
The whole thing is a big shame. She's such a nice young girl.
I don't see a problem with it. Perhaps they're in love.
You're right. It's shameful. Still, what is anyone supposed to do? It's her life.
By the Nine! This IS the Amulet of Kings!
Who are you? How did you get this? What do you know of the Emperor's death?
That's all I know about Kvatch.
Really? With your own eyes? Damn. So we've got real trouble. And no emperor. That's real bad.
It looks bad. It is bad. But we're tough. We'll rebuild.
The guards have to clear the ruins first. That won't be easy.
But I'll be here. This is my town. Nothing is driving me out of here.
We are from Kvatch.
I'm not going out there. What's the point? There's nothing left. I'll just stay right here.
Maybe we can rebuild. But things will never be the same.
We had everything here. Beautiful gardens. Fresh mountain air. Did you know Kvatch had the only Arena in Cyrodiil outside the Imperial City?
All gone now, though. Just smoke and mud and rubble.
From what I've heard, Kvatch is gone. Completely. Burned to the ground.
It's all rumor, sure. I haven't seen it. But I haven't heard anyone say otherwise.
The whole city is burned right down to the ground. There's no point in even being here. We ought to just get away to someplace safe.
I've never seen anything like this. It's horrible, just horrible. I'm just going to keep my head down, and follow my orders.
Kvatch? You've seen it. Kvatch doesn't exist any more.
It was a terrible night. I don't know how any of us survived. The whole city was burning.
My home.... my goddamn home, in flames. It kills me that I can't get in there and DO something.
We couldn't have been any less prepared for this. Seems like they came out of nowhere. There were just so many of them...
If only I had a way to strike back at the enemy. But we can't leave the barricade until that Oblivion Gate is closed.
Yes, I followed the priest here. I'll be safe here, won't I? They can't come on holy ground, can they?
The destruction was worse than I had feared. So many dead... it was almost better not knowing. Then at least I had hope.
Go look for yourself. The town is gone. And most of its people.
The Daedra came out of the gate in the middle of the night.
People who fought, died. People who ran... they at least had a chance.
I don't like to talk about it. I don't remember much.
I woke to screaming and fire. I ran.
I was lucky. I survived. My friends weren't so lucky.
It... it all happened so fast. It was all we could do to round up the survivors and try and get them to safety. We've failed them miserably.
Late at night, while we were all asleep, a door to Oblivion opened.
Daedra came out and set fire to the town. Many people died, but some got out alive.
A gate opened and daedra poured out. Everybody ran. Or they died.
I don't know how the fire started, but it burned Kvatch to the ground.
I really can't tell you what happened. I'm just lucky to be alive.
I was in my basement. Suddenly there was a lot of noise and heat.
I stepped outside, and the whole town was on fire, smoke everywhere. I ran for the gate.
I got through the gate, and kept running through the woods by the light of the fires.
I slept in the woods. I came back in the morning, and Kvatch was gone.
There was nothing I could do. I just ran. If I hadn't, I'd be dead.
We can't talk here. Too public. Meet me behind the Great Chapel at midnight. Don't let anyone follow you. I'll make it worth your while.
Then there's nothing I can do. Too bad.
Oh! Sorry, I... I just assumed. Well, if there's anything else I can do for you, please just ask.
All right, my friend. You've got 100 gold down on the Blue Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
All right, my friend. You've got 100 gold down on the Yellow Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
Oh... well... it would seem you don't have the 100 gold required to place a bet. Best come back when you've got enough coin.
All right, my friend. You've got 50 gold down on the Blue Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
All right, my friend. You've got 50 gold down on the Yellow Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
Oh... well... it would seem you don't have the 50 gold required to place a bet. Best come back when you've got enough coin.
All right, my friend. You've got 25 gold down on the Blue Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
All right, my friend. You've got 25 gold down on the Yellow Team. Good luck, and enjoy the match! Oh, and if you win, come see me for your payout!
Oh... well... it would seem you don't have the 25 gold required to place a bet. Best come back when you've got enough coin.
All right, then, the Yellow Team it is. How much do you want to bet?
All right, then, the Blue Team it is. How much do you want to bet?
My master is a collector of Ayleid antiquities. It has come to his attention that you recently sold an item that interests him.
I believe the note will give you all the details.
You know, I haven't seen him around for a while. But I'm still getting paid, so what do I care?
I am one of his guard dogs, no more, no less. He pays us well to guard his many treasures. This is enough for me.
An unfortunate end to a profitable relationship. Where will we find another like him?
I wonder how he could have miscalculated so badly. Those old Elves didn't seem as glad to see him as he expected, eh?
I never suspected Umbacano might be up to no good. Apparently he was as mad as he was rich!
Our mutual employer rarely tells us the whole story, but he pays very well! Not that I should be giving advice to one of my rivals, ha ha ha!
I got no complaints. Kind of an arrogant bastard if you get right down to it, but he pays us well enough.
A bit eccentric. Loves old things. He's practically got a museum upstairs. But he'd never let anybody else see it, oh no!
My master has not returned from his expedition to Nenalata.
I fear the worst, but Umbacano Manor remains in my charge, and I will keep it in readiness for his return.
My master is not available at the moment. Perhaps you can call again another day.
Shall I show you up?
I'm sorry, but my master is not receiving visitors at this hour. If you come back in the morning, I'm sure he would be glad to see you.
My master, Umbacano, is known across Cyrodiil as a collector of Ayleid antiquities. He is always interested in rare artifacts from that era.
Why, do you have something of interest to my master?
My master, Umbacano, lives in the Talos Plaza District of the Imperial City. He is known across Cyrodiil as a collector of Ayleid antiquities.
You know, sometimes I get thirsty during the night shift. Duck out to the Tiber Septim for a quick drink.
Not like anyone would notice. I mean, what are the chances a thief would choose that moment to try to break in?
I keep an eye on his place. Stuffed full of treasure, you know? But no dirty thief's getting in while I'm on duty.
The Count has ordered the Guard to defend the city to the last man. There will be no panic here.
We're next. I'm sure of it. First Kvatch, now Skingrad! The daedra won't stop until we're all dead!
Have you seen the Oblivion Gate? I haven't dared leave the city since I heard about it.
Count Skingrad is a very private person. I handle all the county's public affairs, and consult with the Count when necessary.
The whole West Weald is pretty good goblin hunting country. They're thick here in Colovia, along the Valenwood and Elsweyr borders.
It's a town, like any other. Well, go outside, and there's the mountains and wines and sheep. Here in town, though, nothing special.
We are from Skingrad.
Please, travel there as soon as possible. The Count is waiting for you.
The town is very nice, but I advise you get out and see the countryside... the vineyards and farms, pastures and sheepfolds. Lovely mountain country.
What? You want a tour? Can't you see I have a lot on my mind? Go bother a beggar or guard... they stand around and chatter all day.
Fadus Calidus at the Fighters Guild also teaches Block, but he'd be the first to admit I'm his superior in every way.
I've lived here all my life. Grown grapes. It's all I know. Fresh air, mountains, the grapes on the vine. It's just... beautiful.
Gaston and I make great wines, reasonably priced. Skingrad has two great vintners - Tamika and Surilie. I'll never say a word against Tamika's wines.
Skingrad is the wine-producing capital of Tamriel. You must sample our local wines. You'll never taste better.
The 415 vintages were particularly good. The 399... well... a once-in-a-lifetime experience... IF you can find a bottle.
I'm the only alchemist in Skingrad. Not much business here, but I can't go back to Morrowind. It's just like anywhere else in the Empire.
By the way... do you happen to know what the fine is here in Cyrodiil for necrophilia? Just asking.
You wouldn't think it, but our rocky soil is perfect for tomatoes. The same ground that produces our glorious wines produces my splendid tomatoes.
The Chapel of Julianos is always open for worship and contemplation. Perhaps you should speak to Marie Palielle, our healer and Restoration trainer.
I could never leave Skingrad. All my good friends here would die without my sweetrolls. The rest of the world must suffer as best it can without me.
Believe me, Mehrunes Dagon will know he was in a fight if he tries to take this city from me.
I'll be honest, that Oblivion Gate out there scares me. And believe me, nobody that works in the Skingrad Guard scares easy.
The city lies southwest of the Imperial City. The castle overlooks the city from a steep hill. You should have no trouble finding it.
Count Skingrad has ruled here all my life. The county is quiet and prosperous.
In the old days, the Colovian Estates were always in the thick of some war or rebellion. But that's ancient history.
A primate has better things to do than provide tourist information. Beggars have plenty of time on their hands. I'm sure you'll have much in common.
Perhaps you'd better speak to my steward. I'm afraid I have little time to spend with visitors to Skingrad.
Wander the streets, fields, and public places of Skingrad to your heart's content. Just don't include me in your social explorations.
Try our wines and cheeses, and Salmo's sweetrolls. See the castle... but don't expect to see the Count. He doesn't mix with strangers.
I'm captain of the Castle Guard, and Dion is captain of the town guard. It's simple. I don't care what goes on in town... that's Dion's problem.
What brings you to Skingrad? Hunting goblins? Sure, they're thick in the West Weald, but you'll find their holes all over Cyrodiil.
Have you met Adrienne Berene, our Skingrad Mages Guild head? Not the most pleasant person, I'll admit. Don't mind her.
Interested in training? I do the Conjuration courses, and Druja does the Mysticism.
Perhaps you should seek out a priest. Perhaps a beggar. Or guardsman. You and I, we have nothing common. What could we possibly talk about?
I served as a Legion Marksman for twenty years. I retired here to Skingrad, work in the vineyards, and supplement my income as an advanced trainer.
Ask me what I think about chapels, praying, the Nine Divines. Go ahead. Ask me.
I like Skingrad just fine. Folks are a little quiet by Skyrim standards, but they're friendly and loyal when they get to know you.
Well, the local wine is great. It isn't cheap. But I don't bother with beer or ale any more, and for a Nord, that's saying something.
Well, it's a bit rugged. Nothing like the Arcane University. Have to go to the Imperial City to buy anything. But it's good enough, I suppose.
I'm not worried about the Gates. We'll be safe enough inside the walls.
Don't count on seeing the Count at the castle. He's a great sorcerer, but he doesn't like visitors.
What do people do here? In town, shopkeepers, smiths, priests... the usual. Fighters and Mages Guild.
The rest are farmers or herders. Wines are a Skingrad specialty, and the Surilie and Tamika Vineyards are famous all over Cyrodiil.
If it's not one thing, it's another. The Count is very particular about his food and drink. Everything must be just so.
Reman Broder... he works Surilie's vineyard, I work Tamika's vineyard... Reman spent 20 years in the legion, and he's an advanced Marksman trainer.
Skingrad's wines are the best in Tamriel. I  invite you... try them for yourself. Here, it is perfect for grapes, and perfect for wine.
The sun and soil here are like my native Hammerfell, but the climate is milder, and the rainfall more reliable.
Actually, underground goblin lairs are no more common here in the West Weald than anywhere else in Cyrodiil.
Where can you get sheep's cheese but in Skingrad? And why? Because only in Skingrad is Uuras, Master of Sheep's Cheese!
I can also teach a bit of Athletics. Why, you ask? Because I am the mountain sheep's brother, and I must dash with him from crag to crag.
There's so much I could tell you... so many secrets... but then you'd be in danger, too. It's best if we're not seen talking.
So do we all. But what path can be avoided whose end is fixed by the almighty Gods?
You will find your own path. Take care... there will be blood and death before the end.
Perhaps the Gods have placed you here so that we may meet.
As for what you have done... it does not matter.
That is not what you will be remembered for.
I am your emperor, Uriel Septim. By the grace of the Gods, I serve Tamriel as her ruler.
You are a citizen of Tamriel, and you, too, shall serve her in your own way.
Assassins attacked my sons, and I'm next.
My Blades are leading me out of the city along a secret escape route.
By chance, the entrance to that escape route leads through your cell.
Assassins attacked my sons. A secret passage here leads out of the city.
The captain and her men... it's their duty to protect me. I will do as they say.
How many times can I say it? There's no time to waste! Hurry it up!
Ha ha, I knew you'd be up to it!
Our goal is the Castle gate. We should be able to use this door to get out to the plaza in front of the Castle gatehouse.
You know the drill. Stick close, and keep your eyes open. Let's move out!
Count Goldwine is the embodiment of nobility. He's always ruled Kvatch with a fair hand, and listened to the needs of his people.
He was a valiant warrior in his day, and inspired us all to be our best. I heard he personally led one of the first retaliations to the attack.
But then, things got confused. Even the Legion troops stationed here couldn't hold the defenses.
Count Goldwine retreated to the castle, determined to hold on to it at any cost. He's still in there now, I'm sure.
That's why we've got to get in there and make sure he's safe. We owe him our allegiance, and besides, he'd do the same for any of us.
You can bet on either the Yellow Team or Blue Team. The opponents are always evenly matched, so your chance of winning is 50/50.
For each fight, you can bet 25, 50 or 100 gold pieces. You can bet as many times as you want per day, within the hours of 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM.
If you win, you get back double what you bet. Simple as that. Win or lose -- it's mostly a matter of luck.
If, by any chance, you're interested in actually fighting in the Arena, you need to head down to the Bloodworks and speak with Owyn, the Blademaster.
Just head through the door here on my right and take the stairs down. Be on your best behavior, though. Owyn is a bit... cranky by nature.
May Talos guide his soul to Aetherius. Rest in peace, my Lord.
My job is to make sure the Emperor gets out of here alive, and I intend to do it.
Have you spoken to Valus Odiil recently?
Undoubtedly. There's hardly a cloud in the sky.
Greetings! How are you on this fine morning?
Well, I must be going. Take care.
I spoke to him yesterday. He seems rather concerned about those boys of his.
It looks to be a beautiful day here at Weynon Priory, don't you think?
Fine. Thanks for asking.
Good morning, my friend!
I understand about duty. Don't get me wrong. Should've been more than one guy on this job, and I've got my family to think about. They come first.
Thanks. I'm not trying to shirk my duty, but it used to be two or three men would be on this. I like the Guild, but I've got a family to consider.
I don't own it. One of the rare book dealers in the Market District may have a copy. Read it. Educate yourself.
I trust that you will be able to remain professional?
I believe a little friendly competition always sharpens the wits. Even more reason for you to get back to hunting for my carving.
My methods were vindicated. Apparently Maric was more capable than you. I'm sure you will try harder the next time.
I hope you don't blame me for the unpleasantness with Maric. I have no control over the man. In any case, it all turned out well, didn't it?
You are cautious and perceptive. Good traits to have in this business. Yes, you guess correctly. This one is working for Maric.
He never tells us anything, though. Just between the two of us, this one thinks Maric is cheating him. In fact, this one is sure of it.
Listen. S'razirr has an idea of how we can both come out of this ahead.
The original offer is still on the table: this one helps you against Maric in return for half your take. What do you say?
I kept my side of our bargain. Make sure you keep yours.
Don't worry, this one will back you up when the time comes.
Must I hold your hand? I begin to wonder what Umbacano sees in you. It is an Ayleid ruin in the far west of this province, up in the Valus Mountains.
Strange ruins, huh? You'd have to be crazy to go in there. I'm just here for the scenery and fresh air.
An unfortunate encounter for both of us. But as I said, it was only business. No hard feelings, I hope.
You showed admirable prudence. I was not half so sensible at your age, ha ha ha! Not to worry, I'm sure you will get the drop on me one day!
You're probably wondering what this one is doing in this gods-forsaken wilderness. Same here. S'razirr doesn't get paid nearly enough for this.
Beautiful countryside, don't you think? We're just doing a bit of hunting and sightseeing, not that it's any of your business.
Then I don't understand why you are still here in the Imperial City. You should return to Malada and retrieve the carving!
You will go far in this business, my friend. You know when you've won, and when you've lost. Until we meet again!
Wonderful! You are indeed a treasure hunter of exceptional talents! Here is your reward as promised!
Normally I would give you a chance to celebrate your success, but I do have another task for you, if you are interested. A rather urgent one.
My interest was in recovering the carving from Malada, and Maric has already delivered it to me.
Our arrangement was clear. I would pay you for delivering me the carving. Since Maric delivered the carving, he earned the reward.
I thank you for your efforts, but I am sure you understand that I cannot pay you for a task that you did not complete.
However, I do have another task, a rather urgent one in fact, if you would like to redeem yourself.
Yes, you learned that it is the ruin now known as Malada. Were you able to recover the carving yet?
Your first task is to locate the ruins of the High Fane. I believe it must now be known by a different name.
Shouldn't you be off to Malada to retrieve the carving I want?
The carving you recovered from Malada will be invaluable in my research on the Late Ayleid Period.
I'm sorry you were not able to fulfill your part of our agreement, but I consider the matter closed. Please do not speak of it again.
The High Fane dates from the Late Ayleid Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people.
A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane.
I believe this carving will shed new light on Ayleid history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.
You will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane.
I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the High Fane, many years ago.
I'm not surprised. I have not been able to find any modern reference to it.
Still, the architectural detail is distinctive enough, it may still be recognizable.
Malada? Really? I confess, I had never made the connection. But, yes... it makes sense...
In any event, this should make your job easier than I had feared.
Very well. Perhaps I misjudged you after all.
Excellent. Here, take a look at this sketch. The ancient texts refer to this site only as "The High Fane." Do you know it?
This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same.
A rival collector has an item which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers.
She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge.
I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Are you interested?
As I said, I believe I have something that will interest you. More in your usual line of work. And, of course, your reward will be generous.
Have you reconsidered? Will you help me reach the Throne Room of Nenalata?
You have proven yourself more than a simple grave robber. I believe you can handle a more complicated assignment. Are you interested?
Defend yourselves! Here they come!
You have exceeded my fondest hopes, my friend. The Ten Ancestors are reunited at last! This is truly an historic day!
As I promised when we first met, here is your reward for completing the set. Take it with my sincere thanks. It is well-deserved.
You are doing very well in your treasure hunt, my friend. Only one more statue remains to be discovered!
You are very close to earning the reward for completing the set of ten. I urge you to redouble your efforts!
I had never thought to see eight of the Ancestors together again in my lifetime. Well done!
I am impressed. Only three more statues to complete the set. Keep up the good work, my friend.
Beautiful. Exquisite. You have proven yourself to be quite resourceful. I have another task which should interest someone of your particular talents.
Ah, a second Ancestor. Excellent. I had wondered whether the first was just luck, but I see now that you have some skill at this work.
By good fortune, my research has uncovered some new information that may help you in your search for the remaining statues.
Well done! Here is your payment as promised.
Wonderful! Remember, I will be happy to give you the same price for any others that you find.
And I'll double your payment if you manage to recover the complete set of ten. I look forward to a long and mutually profitable relationship.
Well then, you have work to do. I will continue to search the archives for any clues to the statues' locations.
Well then, you have work to do. You'd best be on your way.
You know it as White Gold Tower -- the center of the ancient Ayleid capital of Nibenay.
It was brutally sacked thousands of years ago by humans led by Alessia. The Imperial City is built over the ruins of that ancient city.
You were more resourceful than I had hoped. I esteem you greatly for your success in bringing the Ten Ancestors together again after all these years.
I am looking for the complete set of ten for my collection. They were once part of the Temple of the Ancestors in the ancient Ayleid capital.
Through my research, I have learned that they were removed from the temple before its sack by Men.
I believe they were hidden in various Ayleid settlements across Cyrodiil, although I do not know the exact location of any of them.
Why, have you already found another statue for me?
Are you ready to part with your statue now?
Yes? Have you found another statue for me?
Ah, the treasure hunter. Please, have a seat.
I have found the names of a number of Ayleid cities where the statues may have been taken for safekeeping during the siege of White Gold Tower.
The only modern sites that still bear their ancient names are Moranda, Mackamentain, Wenyandawik, Ninendava, and Fanacas.
There is no guarantee that my sources are correct, of course, but these should at least provide a starting point for your search.
Indeed? I am at your service.
Very good. Please follow me.
I am in Nine Divines....I wish I had quests to give...sigh...
I am in the Dark Brotherhood.
Have you not heard of the Dark Brotherhood? Of the remorseless guild of paid assassins and homicidal cutthroats?
Join us, and you'll find the Dark Brotherhood to be all that, and so much more. We are, more than anything, a union of like-minded individuals.
We kill for profit, for enjoyment, and for the glory of the Dread Father, Sithis. We are family, with bonds forged in blood and death.
What? Brother? You misunderstand. I don't have a brother. Maybe I misunderstand ... another bottle of wine will help.
The reigning Grand Champion is Agronak Gro-Malog. His fighting name is "The Gray Prince." He's an Orc... well, Half-Orc, actually, or so they say.
The important thing is he's been Grand Champion for nearly a decade. Why? Because nobody's had the guts to face him. The Gray Prince is unbeatable.
At least, that's what the people of Cyrodiil have come to believe. Maybe it's time someone stepped into that Arena and proved them wrong...
Don't say anything to her. I don't want to embarrass her further. Once this is all taken care of, I'll speak to her privately.
She hasn't been focused on her work recently. It's annoying, frankly.
I don't feel comfortable talking about her with you anymore.
I've never laid a hand on her. Either in anger or... I've never hurt her, okay?
I don't know what to say.
All I want is for her to care about me, to feel the same way as I do about her. But she doesn't.
I try and I try, and it just doesn't matter. It makes me furious sometimes!
Yes, I sort of know her. Well, I mean I don't really know her, but I've talked to her some.
Oh, her. I've seen her around town, but I don't really know her.
Who? Oh, her.
Can't help you. I don't really know her.
The girl hasn't seemed herself lately. I have no idea what's wrong, but something's really bothering her.
Very well. We're anxious to return to Weatherleah, so be sure to let me know as soon as you're ready.
Guilbert and Reynald know nothing of their father's past deeds. If you want to tell them about it, suit yourself.
It was kind of you to escort the Jemanes back to Weatherleah. However, the original owner of Weatherleah left them an even greater legacy.
In fact, there's quite a bit more to their family history than meets the eye. Want to hear about it?
You have decided you have time to listen to my tale after all? It is a good one. I promise you won't be disappointed.
One of the Gray Fox's top bosses, they say. Spends all day drinking at the Oak and Crosier, but he's been asking questions about the Jemanes.
He's Captain of the Chorrol Guard. During the day, you can usually find him on patrol with us around the city.
Did you say something to Bittneld? That was very sweet of you. Now he stops by here every day.
Bittneld -- captain of the castle guard? -- he seems like such a nice fellow. Too bad I don't see him in here very much.
Are you sure? Well, all right. I can't give you a better offer.
I'll just take the money from you then. And here's your staff. Now, since our business is concluded, you must excuse me. Good day.
I'll just take the money from you then... what, you don't have it?
I don't see how we can do business if you don't have the gold for it.
You've got it. I'll have the three Minotaur Lords brought out to the Arena. Now get up there and give the people what they paid for!
You've got it. I'll have the two Minotaur Lords brought out to the Arena. Now get up there and give the people what they paid for!

You've got it. I'll have the Boar brought out to the Arena. Now get up there and give the people what they paid for!
I have seen your name, Traveler, and heard it whispered in twilight. I ask a service, which holds promise of fame and reward.
Many years ago, five followers slew the vampire Dratik and its kin, but all were infected by the foul creature.
Knowing their fate, they sealed themselves up in the vampire's lair. Their suffering weighs heavily on me.
Travel to the Gutted Mine. The door will open to you. Bring the peace of death to my followers, and you shall earn my gratitude.
Thank you, mortal. Their spirits are free, and henceforth, above my shrine, five bright candles shall burn forever in memory of their sacrifice.
For your service, take this token, that your deeds might be entered in the Book of Fate.
The Staff of Indarys it is. Again, I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal, and I especially thank you as an elated father.
Farewell, and may Arkay guide you.
The Thornblade it is. Again, I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal, and I especially thank you as an elated father.
Then it's a sad day in Cheydinhal. The Knights were boastful louts, but they didn't deserve to be killed.
I'll stay here and do a final sweep of the area. You're to report to the Count directly, as he wishes to speak with you.
Are you mad? A Knight of the Thorn never returns home until the mission is done. It's our way.
Now, in my father's name as Count Indarys of Cheydinhal, I order you to lead me to that sigil stone!
I suggest we use the Reman Sweep Formation. You'll assault and we'll guard the rear flank. Onward and upward! Huzzah!
It's tolerated because Farwil is the Count's son. Plain and simple. He has the power and the coin to put it all together.
Most of the time, they lounge around the tavern drinking and making up stories of epic battles with impossible odds that they won.
It's all garbage. They never patrol, they never help fight off the ocassional bandit that slips into the city. Ah well. I've said too much already.
There may be only three of us left, but we still can match blades with the best of them.
As a Knight of the Thorn, you are now expected to carry this symbol of your knighthood. Carry it proudly and wear it well.
We are Knights sworn to uphold the laws of Cheydinhal. We fear no being, and we strike fast and true as lightning.
Many wish to join our ranks, as we are of the highest echelon. Only a select few may join the finest force ever to grace the lands of Cyrodiil.
Until now, we numbered only seven, but attacked like a regiment. Our enemies quake at our approach, and falter at our charge. Huzzah!
There are no quests for you right now, sir knight. Don't fret, though. The Knights will rise to the occasion once again! Huzzah!
I'm saddened by the loss of those brave souls. May Arkay guide all of them to their final rest.
I think if you'd had the chance to speak to any of the knights, they were happy to follow Farwil into battle.
I'll be having a very long talk with my impetuous son. I don't blame him directly for their deaths, but he must learn to do things the proper way.
He must realize he'll be ruling Cheydinhal one day. That's a responsibility I aim to make him ready for.
It's a shame so many of the Knights fell. I suppose their intentions were good, even if they were a bit self-serving.
There are seven of them including Farwil. Even though they're a nuisance, I still hope they haven't been hurt... or worse.
New to these parts, eh?
The Knights of the Thorn are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. Farwil formed the group around two years ago.
They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are. The real work goes to us, the City Guard.
I hate to speak ill of them, as something horrible may have happened, but their own bravado got them into this mess.
Yes, I am a member of the Knights of the Thorn. Or what's left of them anyway.
If you want to hear the tale, I suggest you talk to Farwil, our commander.
Suit yourself. Maric may be cheating S'razirr, but at least this one knows what to expect.
But this one is taking all of the risk! What do you have to lose? One fourth, that's S'razirr's final offer.
You won't regret it. This one will keep his eyes open, and wait for an opportunity to help you.
Don't screw this one, though. After the dust settles, look for S'razirr in the Tiber Septim Inn in the Imperial City. Full payment is expected.
We wait and see how this plays out. If and when there's an opportunity, S'razirr will help you against Maric.
If we succeed in recovering the treasure, you give this one half of what you're getting paid.
Are you sure? I truly have no wish to harm you. It is the carving I want. Just business.
Hand it over, and some day we will both laugh about this over drinks at the Tiber Septim. I will give you one last chance.
As you wish. Too bad, I was just getting to like you. Kill him.
You've got it. Good. I'll use it to prove it was we, not the Blackwood Company, who killed him. Good work on this.
Now, get out of here. I'm going to head back to Chorrol. When there's more to do, I'll let you know.
Get the ring for me. We'll need it as proof.
We find Blackheart and get that weapon. We'll finish this contract and let all of Cyrodiil know what happened here.
Blackheart has a fascination with these Ayleid ruins. There's one northeast of here, Atatar. My bet is that he moved his base there. I'll lead.
Come back when you're ready. Don't delay.
Good. Let's go.
Get back to me when you change your mind.
I'm sorry to hear that. Sooner or later, the contracts are going to dry up. Maybe then you'll reconsider.
We leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there.
They weren't always a threat. Small scale mercenary band, until Ri'Zakar took over. Then came the fat Imperial contracts.
After a mission in Black Marsh, they set up shop in Leyawiin. More ruthless than ever. It needs investigating. First, though, you need advancement.
Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are.
I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.
I snooped around. Apparently, they completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job.
There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out.
Vilena's gotten tentative since the Blackheart mission. She's worried about getting us killed. But we're just getting killed a little bit at a time.
Good question. I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained.
All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.
Alright. Please, come back soon. I'll wait for you here.
Please, use the extra bed here. If you sleep too far from Henantier, it may not work. I'll watch over you both to make sure you're safe.
Oh my! I almost forgot!
Henantier once told me that if he's killed in his dreams, anyone that's in there with him will die as well. So, do be careful.
I fear that anyone he knows won't be able to help him in there. Since I'm in his memories, he may dismiss me as a figment of his dreams.
The only chance is for a total stranger to enter his dreams.
When you're ready to do this, I'll give you the amulet. Only I know the secret way it can be removed from his neck.
True, but this is different. When you enter your dreams with the amulet, you're in full command of a dream-like replica of yourself.
All your thoughts, your skills and your talents travel there with you. Think of it as exploring a new land, but a land within your own mind.
Henantier created the amulet to see if he could use his dreams as a training ground to help better himself.
I don't know all of the details, but the amulet is a conduit to get to that training ground.
It's been three days, and he's been stuck in his dreams. I've watched him all that time, and he hasn't been up at all.
The only way to save him is to put on the Dreamworld Amulet and go to sleep. Only then can you hopefully find out what's happened in there.
I wish to never speak of the Dreamworld again. Henantier's free of its grip, and I can't bear a reminder he was ever a prisoner in that dark place.
You'll have to be very careful in there. If Henantier intended it as a training ground, there's no telling what you may encounter.
I told him that trying to travel into one's own dreams is risky. But as usual, he didn't listen to me. Always has to do things his way.
Henantier constructed a magical device he called the Dreamworld Amulet. With this device, one can enter his own mind and experience dreams.
But... how? What you say must be the truth... I feel strange...
I can see now what you were saying was no story at all, but the truth, and I'm a fool. I had no idea that the amulet could hold such power over me.
I set out to create a way to conquer my failings, but it seems the tables had turned, and they conquered me.
I don't know how you did it, but I thank you. Now, we must wake from this dream and take our places in the real world again. Farewell.
Elements? Inside a dream? Bah! That's the most foolish thing I've ever heard! Get away from me... you're clearly insane!
This place is so strange. Dreamworld, you say? It's more like a nightmare. I don't like this place at all. I feel like I shouldn't be here.
There must be an exit around here somewhere. I'd explore this place, but I'm afraid I just don't have the courage to do so.
How could I be so careless? What's the matter with me?
I know I've lost something. Yes, that's it. I've lost many things in this strange place. Would you please help me?
Henantier isn't a prisoner in any physical sense. He's a prisoner of his own mind. He's trapped in his Dreamworld.
You must learn to broaden your thoughts and hold your tongue! Allow me to explain before jumping to conclusions!
Report us? Oh, no. Why, we might never get work from the guild again! And that would be different how, exactly?
A brilliant idea! Oreyn only sends his best these days. Tell you what. You go find us some paying work, and we'll happily go about it.
Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Protector. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.
Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Swordsman. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.
Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Journeyman. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.
Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Apprentice. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.
Oh? We must? Well, last I saw, you didn't outrank me, Associate. I suggest you mind your manners... and your own business.
You are no better than that renrij Maric. S'razirr should have known better than to trust you. Get out of this one's sight.
That is not the right answer. S'razirr knows you have been paid by Umbacano. Oh yes, this one has listened much since we met at Malada.
S'razirr will not be cheated again. The question is asked again: will you pay what was promised?
You are honorable. Unlike that renrij Maric, may the moons never shine upon his path. This one will not forget.
I'm sorry to hear that. Especially since Maric has not delivered the carving either.
Let me be clear: whoever delivers the carving will receive the reward. All I care about is the carving.
You know what? I will help you, although it is liable to get you killed. The High Fane is now known as Malada, up in the Valus Mountains.
But I do not advise you to go there. Read "The Cleansing of the Fane" first. Then decide. As I said, a very bad place.
What would be the sport in me just telling you? I'm not that drunk yet! No, you must earn your pay.
Read "The Cleansing of the Fane." You may be less eager to seek the High Fane then.
Found him, did you? Well, I suppose that's good.
You'll have to forgive me... I seem to have misplaced something. Hmm. Yes, well, let's nevermind that.
You've fulfilled your end of the bargain, though, so I'll fulfill mine. Raminus will have my recommendation.
And don't you forget about me once you've finished your training! I'm sure we can help each other out!
You've fulfilled your end of the bargain, so now I'll fulfill mine. Raminus will have my recommendation.
Let's just keep this incident between us, okay? It might make... a bad impression.
He's disappeared.
I mean he's really disappeared. No one here has seen him in days. Volanaro thinks maybe a spell backfired.
If someone from the Council were to stop by, and find him gone, it'd look bad for me. I can't have that.
Talk to the mages here, and see what you can find out. If you can make J'skar re-appear, you'll have your recommendation.
He was the only one left?
This is worse than I thought.
From what he's told you, Mannimarco -- the King of Worms -- is here in Cyrodiil, and preying on our Guild. This is something I'd never have dreamed.
We'll need a few days to digest this new information. Should J'skar arrive here, we'll see to it that he's well taken care of. Thank you.
Yes, yes. You're quite the sleuth, finding him all by yourself. Jeanne will be so proud, I'm sure.
Our little transaction has been concluded. You may return victorious to Jeanne. Lucky you.
Just watch. You'll see.
Just wait. He'll be here shortly.
Bring me Jeanne's Manual of Spellcraft, and then we'll talk about helping you find J'skar.
You want to find J'skar?
All right, I think I can help with that. But you have to agree to do something for me, first.
And whatever you do, you can't tell Jeanne about it. All right?
I've already told you, I'm not helping unless you agree to do something for me. Do we have a deal, or not?
Oh, I might know where he is, I suppose.
I'm afraid I don't trust you enough to talk about it, though. You are working for Jeanne, after all.
Hmm? Oh, Jeanne has you looking for him, does she?
I'm afraid you're not going to find him easily. I think a, uh, spell backfired. That's probably it.
Look, I don't know you very well. Why would I help you?
He's invisible, and you've about as much luck finding him as Jeanne does. Excuse me.
Look, I like you and all, but I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
If Volanaro and J'skar want to have their fun, fine. I'm not going to participate, and I'm not saying another word about it. Take it up with them.
I haven't seen him in days. Volanaro said something about a spell backfiring, making him permanently invisible.
Maybe you should go see him about it. I don't feel like talking about it with you.
The guild's been attacked? Did you find anyone alive?
Get back there at once! We need to know if anyone survived!
Make sure she's all right, will you? It's not like her to avoid contact with the University for so long.
She won't figure this out for weeks!
Ah, it's times like this I enjoy what I do.
With all due respect to our wonderful leader...
She couldn't cast her way out of a paper sack. It's insulting that we're here, working for her, when she knows nothing.
She's managed to butter up the right people just enough to keep her position, and there's little we can do about it.
But we have our ways of coping with the situation.
I suppose I like her well enough.
It's a shame she doesn't know more about her craft, though.
Still, I don't quite think she deserves the hard time the others give her.
Finding ways to confuse her just never gets old for me. It's good practice of our skills too. But it's mostly just funny.
I'm sorry, but I don't think so. The guild doesn't accept wanted criminals. Get rid of that bounty on your head, and perhaps I'll reconsider.
Well, then. It's no small matter; membership in the guild is quite an honor, but also a responsibility. Do you wish to join the guild?
You're a wanted criminal. The guild doesn't accept criminals. Understand? Clear things up, and then come back.
Well, no bounty on your head, and you look able enough. Very well; are you sure you want to join the guild?
Looks to me like you're in trouble with the law. Clear that matter up, and then perhaps we'll discuss the guild.
The guild is always accepting new members. You seem capable enough; are you sure you want to join?
You're a wanted criminal, hardly the sort of person that has a place in the guild. Clean up that record of yours, and maybe you'll be considered.
You're interested in joining? Great things will be expected of you. Are you sure you're ready for it?
I'm sorry, but the guild doesn't accept criminals as members. Get rid of that bounty on your head, and we'll talk.
As long as you're not a wanted criminal, there's a place for you in the guild. Are you interested?
Is this a joke? Do I look like I associate with common criminals, let alone grant them access to the guild? Begone.
Are you sure you're up to it? You seem a little... slow.
Oh, no. You can't join the guild with that bounty on your head. Get that taken care of, and then come see me again.
The guild is accepting new members, but it may require some hard work on your part. Are you sure you wish to join?
Very well. You are now an Associate of the Mages Guild. The full guild hall is now available for your use.
You'll need a recommendation from each local guild hall in order to advance further. Until then, the Arcane University will be closed to you.
Welcome to the guild, and good luck to you.
Then I declare you to now be an Associate of the Mages Guild. Welcome to the ranks.
You'll need to acquire recommendations from all the local guild hall leaders to advance further in the guild.
If they're smart, they'll take the opportunity to have you perform a small service for them. One good turn deserves another, after all.
We have a responsibility to look after one another, don't we? I dare say we do, no matter what the costs.
Very good! You are now an Associate of the Mages Guild. What a wonderful opportunity for you!
Now, please keep in mind that you'll need recommendations from every local guild hall in Cyrodiil before you may enter the Arcane University.
I dare say my opinion might carry more weight than others, if you take my meaning. Still, all are necessary to proceed. Good luck to you!
Then you are now an Associate of the Mages Guild.
You must receive a recommendation from every local guild hall in Cyrodiil before you may advance through the ranks of the guild.
In the meantime, as a member of the guild, you now have full access to the guild halls around Cyrodiil. Only the Arcane University is closed to you.
All right, then. You're now an Associate of the Mages Guild.
You'll need to receive a recommendation from each local guild hall in Cyrodiil to advance in the guild, and be given any sort of responsibility.
They can be done in any order, but they all must be sent in to the Council before you can enter the Arcane University.
I expect this will end in disaster, but nonetheless, I will grant your request.
Very well... you are now an Associate of the Mages Guild.
To advance in the guild, you'll need recommendations from each local guild hall in Cyrodiil. A feat which I'm sure will elude you completely.
If you manage to actually receive the recommendations, you'll be eligible for entrance to the Arcane University. I shall be quite surprised, as well.
Now unless you wish to attempt to impress me with your no doubt staggering intellect, I have actual work to attend to.
Welcome, child, to the Guild of Mages. You shall be called Associate by all.
Recommendations you need, from all guild halls in Cyrodiil. None will be easy to acquire. Too many motives, too much noise.
May luck be with you, and may your wisdom guide you well. The Arcane University will need your help someday. I have seen it.
No? Very well. Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
No? Joining the guild is a good idea for anyone who wishes to become a powerful mage, you know.
I see. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm sure I could be helpful.
Well then. If you re-think your decision, I'll be around.
Hmm. Well, that's your choice.
Hrmph. Not much of a loss, if you ask me.
As you say. Perhaps fate will return you to us, someday?
Get your men out of here!
All of you! Out! Now!
Nothing more for you, Imperial! Get out!
You're paying for all of this!
Leave here now, Redguard!
You scare off my customers. Go away!
I'll never let an Orc drink here again!
Dirty Orc! Get out!
Filthy Orc! I smell you from here!
Stop these maniacs!
You make them leave!
Get them out of here!
You've never worked an honest day in your life, you stupid orc!
Go root in the mud, pig man!
If it weren't for me, you'd be mucking stables in Orsinium!
You've always been too smart for your own good.
I'm tired of working with you anyway. And you're a lousy swordsman, Rellian!
When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.
How about you send over a few more drinks, sweetheart?
Barkeep! A refill!
Hurry it up, swamprot! I'm thirsty over here.
Get outta here! We don't need you around.
Mind your damn business, stranger.
You need to find us work. You're supposed to be boss!
You don't find something soon, I'm gonna lose my temper.
I'm tired of wasting time with you!
Never liked you, Redguard. Never will.
I'll snap you in half, little man.
I'll show you where you can put that fancy sword!
More beer, sweetcakes!
Send over a drink. And make it quick!
Settle down, pondscum.
You don't belong here. Get out!
Stay outta my business!
We wouldn't be here if you'd done your job!
I should have stayed in Hammerfell.
You're not half the man your father was.
You? You wouldn't know a good sword if it stabbed you in the throat!
Go back to your sty, pig man.
I've ridden horses with better sense than you.
Don't get your tail in a knot.
Send me a drink, barkeep. And make it quick.
What are you looking at? Keep pouring drinks!
Keep walking, stranger.
Thank you for returning Henantier to me. I don't know what I would have done without him.
My poor Henantier. I shudder to think what's happened to him in there.
We aren't going far, so no need to prepare for a long journey. In fact, he's still in town. More I can't say aloud without risk of others hearing.
I miss him so. We were study-mates at the Arcane University and we've come to grow fond of each other over the years.
He's always getting himself into jams with the careless ways he performs his experiments, and well, I'm afraid he's done it again.
I'm going to level with you, as you seem like you wish to help.
Henantier isn't missing. On the contrary, I know exactly where he is. The problem is he's trapped and there's no way I can free him.
I'll miss him dearly. Don't feel upset, I know you did the best you could to bring him home.
Even though he may be a bit misguided, I'm still proud to call him my son.
Cheydinhal will mourn his loss.
Perhaps this journey with you has tought him a lesson. Only time will tell.
Farwil is a Dunmer, and he's wearing steel plate armor. His shield should bear the crest of the Knights. Nothing but the best for the Count's son.
About two days ago, Count Indarys's son, Farwil, entered the Oblivion Gate with six other men. We haven't heard from them since then.
The Count fears the worst, and has posted guards here so we can watch and see if anyone comes back out. So far, nothing.
At this point, Count Indarys is offering a reward for the recovery of his son from inside the gate... or confirmed news of his demise.
If you find him or the rest of the Knights of the Thorn, get them out of there. I'm sure that the Count would also be pleased if the gate was closed.
It's a shame Farwil is gone. Although he was boastful and aloof, at least he treated me as an equal. I shall miss him.
Perhaps in the future, Farwil will learn patience and careful planning before dragging us into a situation like that again.
There isn't much more to say. He'll be missed. We'll have to inform the Count... if we get home.
Don't judge Farwil too harshly. Most of what he says is... fabricated. But he's young, and therefore quite brash and inexperienced.
All he wants to do is please his father. I've known him since he was a lad, and fighting to defend Cheydinhal is in his heart.
I just wish his heart was bigger than his hubris.
It's ashame Farwil is gone. Although he was boastful and aloof, at least he treated me as an equal. I shall miss him.
He should be around somewhere. If he's not in the lodge, I'd try looking for him in Cheydinhal.
I'll always remember what you've done for us. From the bottom of my heart I thank you.
Yes, I'm the one looking for my friend. His name is Henantier. If you find him, I'll be glad to offer you a sizeable reward.
Kud-Ei is a member of Bravil's Mages Guild. She put the word out that a good friend of hers went missing.
She's offered a reward, but as far as I know, nobody's taken her up on the offer. Not sure who's missing either, she's keeping quiet about it.
I suppose if you're interested, you could head over there and ask Kud-Ei yourself.
Kud-Ei has always watched over me, and it's good to know she cared enough to seek help when I was in trouble.
Well, not much to say really. These gates to... other places... ummm, well... it's very hard to explain. I'm not sure I even understand it.
I hear tell that the daedra make their way through these and invade our lands. It's sort of a door to the world where they live.
Haven't seen it myself, and don't intend to. Being this close to one makes me nervous. The good news is nothing's come out since Farwil entered.
Well then, you know what they're capable of producing. Although, nothing has come through ever since Farwil entered.
If the guards don't do something about the Oblivion Gate soon, I'm leaving town. It's not safe here!
I don't know where it came from, but a mysterious gate appeared outside the walls of our city. The way the guards are reacting, it must be a threat.
They're massing as if bracing for an attack. The portal is just outside the city walls through the west gates if you want to see for yourself.
Be careful, some say the gate leads to the realm of Oblivion itself!
I'm just glad we escaped with our lives. Oh, don't tell Farwil I said that...
Not long ago, one of those foul gates manifested itself just outside the West Gates of our city. Nothing's come out of it yet, but we fear the worst.
My son, Farwil, has taken some knights and entered the gate bravely in hopes of meeting the enemy head-on.
If you want to help, and we can use all the help we can get, head over to the gate and lend a hand to the guards.
No more will the gate threaten the good people of Cheydinhal. The Knights of the Thorn have triumphed once more!
The sigil stone for this Oblivion Gate is the key. As soon as we have it, we shall rid Cheydinhal of its existence.
I set out with the rest of the Knights to dispatch this blemish on the face of our fine world. When we arrived, we were overwhelmed.
I myself was able to kill perhaps two score of them, but they just kept coming. Only Bremman and I remain alive.
However, with you here now, we can take the sigil stone from that citadel and complete our quest for the good of all Cheydinhal! Huzzah!
Yes, the Oblivion Gate. No match for the Knights of the Thorn!
When the foul portal cursed Cheydinhal with its presence, we bravely entered to do battle with the vermin within.
We killed scores... nay, hundreds of evil daedra! The ground ran thick with their dark blood.
Then, with a mighty blow, I struck the very ground itself. My true strike sundered the magic of Oblivion and destroyed the gate.
Cheydinhal is safe once again thanks to the Knights of the Thorn! Huzzah!
The gate has been closed. Finally, thanks to you, the Knights have a real victory on their hands.
I'm sure you wish to hear the real story rather than Farwil's version.
Not long after the gate opened, Farwil decided an assault was in order. We charged inside, and promptly met resistance.
Three of us were cut down in the first wave. We pressed on, at Farwil's behest. At the base of the citadel, we met a larger second wave of foes.
We lost two more in that skirmish, as well as Farwil and I being wounded badly. It was at this point we considered retreat.
We found the way back blocked by more daedra. So we were stuck here until rescued by you. It's just like Farwil to leap before he looks.
Had we brought a City Watch contingent, we might have taken the sigil stone with minimal losses. Instead, Farwil wanted to prove his point.
The City Watch and the Knights of the Thorn are always at odds. They think we don't have what it takes, and Farwil wanted to show them.
Perhaps we're all to blame. But that's not important right now. We must complete our journey and get that stone. Please help us.
It's a great relief that the gate is gone. Now the people of Cheydinhal can breathe easier.
We will remain out here until the gate is either closed, or something emerges from inside. We need to warn Cheydinhal of impending attacks.
There's only one way to remove that gate. Venture inside, find the gate's sigil stone and take it. Once you have it, the gate should be closed.
From what I hear, you'll appear back where you entered, safe and sound.
Haven't you heard about these gates to Oblivion opening up all over Tamriel?
Strangest thing. One minute we're inside Oblivion, and the next thing I know we're back here and the gate falls apart. How odd.
I haven't seen him in quite some time. But then, this isn't the first time he's been away, so I wasn't really that concerned.
You said he was at Bleak Flats Cave. Haven't you looked there for him?
He's... well, he's an interesting fellow. Sulinus Vassinus can tell you more about him, if you wish to know.
Sulinus should be around here somewhere. Talk to him if you'd like to know more about Erthor.
Rescued him yourself, did you? Well, good for you.
He's back to his normal routine now, all safe and sound. Enjoy taking credit for the work.
A nice enough guy, I suppose, but there was that awful scamp incident last year. That's when Adrienne told him he needed to practice somewhere else.
Somewhere else meaning somewhere far away.
So he settled down in Bleak Flats cave. Did all of his work there, and came back to town twice a week to check in. Hasn't been around lately, though.
He hasn't shown up here in a while. I assumed he was still out at Bleak Flats Cave, where he usually stays.
It's just northwest of Skingrad. Here, see it on the map?
That's where Erthor wound up, after Adrienne told him he couldn't practice in the guild hall anymore. She probably doesn't even remember that.
You might want to make sure she remembers. Especially the part about it being her idea.
Oh, I do remember telling him to go there... hmm. Well, we'll just have to do something about that, won't we?
By we, I mean you, of course. I have something that may help - it's a basic fireball spell, in case you need to defend yourself.
I'll be here when you get back. Good luck!
Oh, dear. I just can't seem to remember where that is. What a shame.
I don't remember where it is, honestly. I know it's west of Skingrad... Druja could probably tell you. She has a better memory than I do.
Very well. Come see me when you're ready, and we'll get started.
Excellent. I just don't have the time to search for him again, but I do need to consult him about some notes he borrowed.
You might want to ask around, and see if anyone can be of some help. Let me know when he's back, and you'll have your recommendation.
Oh. Are you sure? Well, think about it, and if you change your mind, let me know. I really do need some money, you see.
Okay then. I'll just take this gold from you, and I'll head out there right now. No one should even know I'm gone.
In three days or so, Erthor should be back here, safe and sound. I'll fill him in - you just tell Adrienne that you did the work, and you'll be set.
Pleasure doing business with you, friend!
That's all. For now. Good job, though. You got Viranus home safe, and I think it'll do him good. I'll pay him for the contract, and this for you.
Nothing we need to talk about now. I'll pay Viranus for his contract. This is for you. Who knows. I might be able to make soldiers out of you both.
Let me see that. Interesting. The symbols on it are familiar to me. I'll be looking into this.
I suppose that's it, then. Odd that there weren't creatures around the body, though, and that it hadn't been eaten.
I'll pay Donton for his contract, and I've got this for you. Good work getting him back in one piece. I might make a real soldier of you yet.
Could be that. But you said the corpse was intact. Nothing had dined on the gem-hunter. Something doesn't sit right with me about this.
But, she's the Guildmaster. Certainly, she'd.... No. You're right. If the order came from Oreyn, it's a valid one. We should be off immediately.
I'm sorry. It's just that I haven't been given many contracts since my brother... since the accident. Let's go.
Oh. I'm prepared, of course. I'm sure there's no need to speak to Mother at all. Let's go.
Dead? Damn! What got him?
We got the contract from his aunt. Was in Nonwyll looking for gems of some sort. Never heard from again. You and Viranus go find him.
Dead. I can't believe it. So much death.
He's got to be in here somewhere.
He must be in Nonwyll somewhere. Let's get there quickly.
A mission? Well... of course! I'm sure we can do this. You say this came from Oreyn himself? Well. Perhaps I should speak with Mother first....
Vilena Donton's eldest son. Good man. We lost him on a botched mission recently. You've probably seen the other wounded around.
If you're smart, you'll steer clear of the subject around the Guildmaster. Perhaps you and I will have time to discuss it more later.
Yes, my older brother. He was lost on a mission. Vitellus died valiantly, as we all knew he would. He was the best of us.
I'm sure our mother is very proud of him.
The youngest Donton? Probably at home. I hear his mother doesn't let him do too much.
You're to accompany him, and make sure he succeeds. He needs some time in the field, to get his confidence up, or he'll never become a good warrior.
Vilena coddles the boy too much. Doesn't want him in the line of fire. Suppose it's no surprise after Vitellus.
A journal? Let me see that... Blackwood Company! Bastards! Rank amateurs!
I don't like to think how Vilena is going to take this news. He was my responsibility. I'll be the one to tell her.
I want you to lay low for a while. Talk to Azzan or gro-Khash. Let me deal with Vilena. You've still got a career ahead of you.
Dead? Dead! What happened? A journal? Let me see that... Blackwood Company! Bastards! Rank amateurs!
Best not to speak of him now. Go on about your business.
A journal? Sounds like he fought bravely. I should have known the Blackheart Company was involved. Reckless amateurs!
Dead? It can't be!  What happened? You didn't think to find some evidence? Get back there. Find out what went wrong, dammit!
I sent him on a mission to Forsaken Mine. He and some others were supposed to clear the place of trolls. Haven't heard back from them in days.
I want you to go check it out. I don't need to tell you how sensitive a matter this is. Get moving, and report back to me as soon as possible.
My son? He's at home, I would imagine.
I'm Viranus Donton. What can I do for you?
His mother's been holding him back, protecting him. You'll go to Nonwyll Cavern with him. Galtus Previa was lost there, and you're to find him.
And not a word of this to the Guildmaster! Go find him. He'll be in the Donton house, most likely. And bring him back in one piece!
Lord Dagon is the Enemy. He is the Prince of Destruction, and the Daedra are his servants.
The Chapel is cast down, and the faithful... my friends... all dead.
The Enemy has won, and we are destroyed.
The Imperial line is dead, and the gods have forsaken us.
Where is our blessing? Where is our protection?
Where are our gods? The Enemy triumphs, and we die alone.
Against all hope, you returned from Camoran's Paradise with the Amulet of Kings! We now have a chance to turn back Dagon's invasion.
I must go to the Temple of the One and perform the ceremony to relight the Dragonfires.
But we must hurry! The barriers between our world and Oblivion weaken with every Gate that is opened.
If Mehrunes Dagon is able to cross over into our world, even relighting the Dragonfires will not be able to send him back.
The only way to close all the Oblivion Gates forever is for me to relight the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One.
Our only hope is to recover the Amulet of Kings from Mankar Camoran.
It is now clear to me that the only way to stop the Oblivion invasion is to relight the Dragonfires.
Emperor, Amulet, and Dragonfire--with these divine gifts, the daedra of Oblivion have been kept at bay for thousands of years.
While the Dragonfires burned, the divine barriers kept the daedra from making more than fleeting visits to our world.
But the Dragonfires can only be relit by an heir of the Septim blood wielding the Amulet of Kings.
This was the essence of Mankar Camoran's plot. He was undone only by the merest... chance... but his complete victory remains perilously close.
We must recover the Amulet of Kings and relight the Dragonfires, before it is too late to stem Dagon's invasion.
Something has changed to make these stable portals to Oblivion possible.
Jauffre believes that the death of the Emperor and the darkening of the Dragonfires is the key.
They are stable portals between our world and Oblivion. They violate the most basic principles of daedric magic. They should be impossible.
Something fundamental must have changed to make them possible.
Some kind of portal to Oblivion. The enemy used them to attack the city -- they appeared outside the walls and daedra poured out!
They've opened one right in front of the city gates. Until that Gate is closed, the best I can do is try to hold these barricades.
You did it! You closed that damned Gate! Now we have a chance to take the enemy by surprise.
You don't need to understand. Just tell Adrienne that the new Associate is the one who saved you. Or else. Are we clear?
Right, okay. Listen, when you go back to Skingrad, don't tell Adrienne I was the one who saved you, okay?
All right, Erthor. You're safe now.
Y-yes. I understand. I'll head there right now, okay?
What? I don't understand...
Oh, Sulinus! Thank you for coming to get me! I was afraid I'd be trapped here forever!
Oh, spare me. You're lucky I bothered to send someone after you at all. In the future, would you please be more careful?
So it would seem. You are unharmed, I presume?
Erm, well... yes. I'll just pack up my supplies and be on my way, then. Thank you for sending someone to help me.
Well, my pride is a little wounded...
Adrienne, I'm back! I was rescued!
At times, they served her well. She gained something of a reputation in the guild, and was highly valued by the Council.
As she aged, the visions became less coherent. Rather than cast her aside, the Council gave her a position here.
Some resent her, and wish she'd disappear. I do not. I am proud to help her with her daily tasks.
Too many voices, too loud in my head. How can I hear when all are shouting?
Agata is the first person I go to when I need something. Maybe I should talk to Dagail instead, but I just don't feel comfortable doing that.
She's been a great help to all of us in the guild. Without her, I think Dagail would be lost at times.
She's the one you want to talk to if you actually need something to get done around here. I don't even know why Dagail is still around.
She may be young, but her heart is old and wise. It guides her well through these troubled times.
She was a very powerful mage once, from what I understand. Hard to imagine that, honestly.
A nice lady, but strange. Talks to herself far more often than one should, in my opinion.
Sometimes I wonder why she hasn't just retired, and gone someplace to rest.
I heard she was put in charge of the Leyawiin guild hall as a favor, not because she deserved it. That doesn't seem right, does it?
She's led such a troubled life. I just do what I can to make it easier on her.
I think he's around here somewhere.
Maglir? I think I've seen him. Try in the Lonely Suitor Lodge.
I can't believe we lost another to that bunch. Well done taking care of the contract, though. We can't afford to lose any of them, these days.
Here's your payment for completion of the contract. I think it's time for us to discuss the Blackwood Company a bit.
Take care of his contract. We'll discuss him later.
The little bastard! We took him in when no one else would. This is how he repays us? Talk to Aryarie in Bravil. She's our client. Do the job.
That's right. The little vermin has defaulted on another contract. I need you to go babysit him again.
Ah... you've got it. Looks fresh, too! I realize that you'll be paid by your superior, but take this as well. It might come in handy in your work.
Doesn't look like you have it yet. Let me know when you do.
I need imp gall for my studies. Ten portions of it, in fact. Since I hired the Fighters Guild, I expect you to get it done. And carefully, please.
You might check Robbers Glen Cave for the imp gall. That place has been known to contain the imps.
Oh, just drop it anywhere. I don't think he really cared about it. I think it was some sort of sick joke on his part.
It's not a normal ring, you see. You may find it slightly difficult to carry. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Just as I suspected. If you ever believe yourself to be ready, perhaps we'll have reason to speak.
Hrmph. Very well. We shall see how prepared you actually are.
There was a particular ring of Burden I was testing some time ago. Another stupid Associate somehow got his hands on it, and managed to misplace it.
If I didn't know better, I'd say he purposely tossed it down the well behind the guild hall. Why he would do such a thing is beyond me.
You will retrieve this ring for me. Should you manage to do so, I shall consider sending a recommendation to the University.
The well is locked, so you'll need the key. Deetsan should have a copy of it. Now get moving.
It's such a shame. He didn't deserve to die like that.
He's dead?
Oh, I knew it. I just knew something like this had happened!
Falcar must have known, and yet he said nothing. How could he allow this to happen?
Thank you for letting me know. I'm sorry that you had to be a part of all of this.
He was an Associate, just like yourself. Perhaps not the brightest, but very eager. He was given his assignment from Falcar, and disappeared.
It's like he dropped out of existence! No one knows what happened, and Falcar won't say a word about it.
I heard what happened to him. I wonder if the Mages Council will do anything?
Run into him, have you? As I said, he was incompetent. Couldn't pass a simple lesson.
You needn't concern yourself with him. He was unfit to be a guild member, and it's better that he's no longer part of it.
What a way to go. Awful news, just awful.
Are you sure? I will pay very well. And the matter is urgent. If you decline, I will find someone else.
Very good. I hope you will succeed where I have so far failed.
Very little is known of him, not even his name.
He ruled the last Ayleid city in Cyrodiil during the First Era, three centuries after the Fall of White Gold Tower.
The king of Nenalata is the last Ayleid King known to history, true.
He appears to have ruled for centuries past the fall of all the other Ayleid kingdoms, if the ancient chronicles are to be believed.
But there never was a single King of the Ayleids. Each city-state had its king, and their power waxed and waned over the years.
The king of Nenalata was the "last" simply because all the other kings had been destroyed or driven out of Cyrodiil.
Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district.
She fancies herself a student of the Ayleids, although she sadly lacks any aesthetic instinct whatsover.
Be that as it may. She has come into possession of an ancient relic known as the Crown of the Ayleids. Your job is to acquire it for me.
Here is more than enough gold to buy it at any reasonable price. You may keep whatever you do not use as your fee.
I hoped you would agree. I think you will be perfect for the task at hand.
Very well. I seem to have misjudged you.
Have you brought me the Crown of the Ayleids?
Reputedly the crown worn by the last king of the Ayleids. It deserves to be part of my collection.
It's gone. I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know anything about that. Suit yourself. I know Umbacano is the one who had it stolen.
I fear for what Umbacano may unleash using that Crown. He is blind to the true nature of the Ayleids.
If it isn't already too late, we would all be better off if you found a different Ayleid Crown for him.
You want to buy my Ayleid Crown? It isn't for sale, at any price. I would think Umbacano would know that by now.
I hope you'll make the right choice. Umbacano must not have the Crown of Nenalata.
Disappointing. Well, let me know when you are ready.
Then allow me to explain the task. The Council of Mages has entrusted me with resolving a situation along the Gold Road.
Several traveling merchants have been found dead along the Gold Road recently, with even more missing. The Council has asked that I put a stop to it.
You are going to help me do so.
It's a sad thing, to think that a mage would kill helpless merchants for the wares they carry.
All found dead along the same stretch of road. The only trait shared amongst them is that each had previously stayed at the Brina Cross Inn nearby.
Normally, this would be a matter for the local law enforcement. Due to certain circumstances, however, the Council has become involved.
We believe these deaths to be the actions of a rogue Mage.
A she, you say? And she's dead? Well, Arielle and Roliand did what needed to be done. No more innocent deaths. At least, for now.
You have done well enough for yourself. I'll pass along my recommendation to Raminus.
Though I must say, I doubt it will do you much good in the end. You'd be surprised how easily they forget about the little people.
The scrolls I have given you should protect you from the magic the mage seems to use most frequently, but do not let your guard down.
He may have more tricks up his sleeve.
Some mages do not abide by the principles of the guild, and operate outside its boundaries. Many hold little value for the lives of others.
The frost burns found on the victims in this case indicate a mage was responsible for their deaths. Likely nothing more than simple robbery.
These scrolls should provide sufficient resistance to frost magic, when and if you do encounter this rogue mage. Use them wisely.
Very good. Let us hurry to the Gray Mare!
Very well. I will wait here until you return. You... you will return, won't you?
There's no more to say about him. He will not be missed.
It's good we've killed him. I'll need his ring as proof that we did the job.
Dead, finally. Good work. Did you retrieve his ring? I want that as proof that the Blackwood Company didn't defeat him.
He's here. I know it. Lead the way.
The bastards! There was no battle. Azani must have made a deal with the Blackwood Company. My guess is that they paid him off.
They get the weapon for Argoth, collect the payment, and tell Azani where the mage is. Easy for Blackheart to retrieve the weapon and collect on it.
We need to find out what happened with him. It's all suspicious to me.
This is his stronghold. Where the Blackwood Company supposedly defeated him. Something's not right here. Come on.
That mission was the start of it. That was when Vitellus was killed. We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Blackheart.
I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat.
Honor, huh? I prefer feeding my family. I figure I owe you one for covering for me, so I'll let you leave. Get moving, before I forget myself.
That means a lot, coming from you. You think I didn't hear about you ratting me out to Oreyn? Now get out of here before my friend and I get angry.
Oh? I know you're the one who ratted me out to Oreyn about that other contract. Go back to Oreyn. Give him my regards. We're done talking.
Look, I know that you covered for me before, so I'll give you this one. Talk to Aryarie at the Mages Guild for the job. After this, we're done.
No? Well, then please excuse me.
I'm afraid I haven't had time to prepare anything conventional. I'm very preoccupied with this situation concerning Ardaline.
Perhaps you can help with that, however. I can't directly get involved, for fear of embarrassing the poor girl.
I'll need you to have a little chat with Varon Vamori, and you can learn something about the power of Illusion in the process.
He sold it, eh? Well, this just keeps getting worse.
Very well. I presume he gave you some indication of where the staff is now located? Take these, and go resolve the situation.
And, of course, please keep this just between us.
You have what you need to help him talk. I admit, it's not standard guild procedure, but I'd do anything for one of my girls.
I don't understand it. Some ridiculous male thing, I suppose. He's been bothering Ardaline every day for a while now.
He even stole her Mages' Staff!
Perhaps he thinks it's amusing; I don't know. But it needs to stop. It's making her miserable.
What? I... I don't know anything about him. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
He lives in the Talos Plaza district of the Imperial City. He's the one who has Ardaline's staff now.
Ah, wonderful! I shall be most pleased to return this to its rightful owner. Thank you.
You needn't tell me the details of what was involved in getting it; it's perhaps better that I know nothing about it.
Your actions for the guild more than merit a recommendation. I shall send it to the University promptly.
And, to thank you more personally, I shall teach you this spell. You may find it useful in certain circumstances.
No staff yet? Well, keep at it. Those charm scrolls should do most of the work for you, if you put them to good use.
Varon Vamori should give it to you once you've persuaded him, if you understand me.
It's more symbolic than practical, but each carries great significance to its owner. You're going to get Ardaline's staff back.
Take this charm scroll. With it, you should find Varon more receptive to questioning. Don't come back without that staff.
You've already purchased the staff, friend. There really isn't much more to say on the subject, is there?
I made you an offer already. Two hundred gold, in exchange for the staff.
Are you prepared to accept it now?
Look, I can't just give it to you. I paid good money for it, after all.
I'll tell you what. You give me at least a portion of what I paid for it, say two hundred gold, and I'll give you the staff.
That's a good deal, right? I wouldn't offer it to anyone else, just you. So what do you say?
As much as I like you, friend, I'm just not willing to part with that staff. It's nothing personal.
Yes, I have the staff Varon sold me. I'm afraid I'm not willing to part with it. I paid good money for it, after all. You understand, of course.
What of it? Varon hasn't sent you, has he? I've told him several times now that I simply can't just give it back to him.
Run along and let him know I haven't changed my mind, will you?
If I still had it, I'd gladly give it back. You'll have to talk to Soris Arenim if you want it.
All right, I admit it. I took it from her. I... I don't know what I was thinking, honestly.
I was trying to tell her how I feel.... again... and she wouldn't even stop to talk to me. I just got so angry!
I was a little ashamed afterwards, but didn't know how to apologize or give it back. I wish I could...
I'm afraid I don't have it anymore, you see. I... I sold it. To a friend of mine, Soris Arenim.
That thing? Soris keeps it locked in a chest, down in the basement. I don't see why he's so careful with it.
It's not like anyone determined enough couldn't get their hands on it; the key is in his desk, after all.
Delmar handles all staff enchantments. You'll need to speak to him about it.
You'll need wood for the staff before Delmar can assist you.
Now that you have the wood, speak with Delmar at the Chironasium.
Wellspring Cave lies to the northeast of the Imperial City. The mages there can assist you.
The wood used for staves comes from a grove to the northeast of the Imperial City, near Wellspring Cave.
Several mages tend to the grove, and should be able to assist you. Speak with either Zahrasha or Elette when you arrive. And choose wisely.
Yes, it's all finished. It's in a cupboard, back at the Chironasium. I hope it serves you well!
Yes, it's all finished. It's in that cupboard, back in the corner. I hope it serves you well!
Come see me when I'm at the Chironasium, and we'll take care of that for you.
I'm working on it. It'll be done soon.
I'm afraid there's little I can do to assist you, unless you have the wood we need to start. Bring me some wood, and we can get to work.
Ah, yes! This is a big step for you, friend. Whether you know it or not.
Now, you'll need to decide what sort of staff you're looking for. Something that fits you, and your abilities. Shall we begin?
Motierre! I am here to exact payment, in blood! You will... eh? Who is this?
The Dark Brotherhood? Oh, you have been a naughty boy, Motierre, haven't you? Stand aside, assassin! Motierre is mine! My employers demand it!
We'll see who gets to cut you, Motierre! Let me show you how a real killer operates, you Dark Brotherhood mongrel! Defend yourself!
Oh no! What am I to do! An underworld enforcer and a Dark Brotherhood assassin, both here to kill poor Francois!
*Gasp* What's this? Oh, Dark Brotherhood assassin, please don't cut me with that wicked blade! It looks like this is the end of poor Francois!
Well, for instance, you could give it to any other goblin tribe.
They'd boast about it just as if they won it in a war, and pretty soon the Cracked Wood tribe would launch a war against THEM.
I'm not sure if the Cropsford settlers would be all too pleased about you stirring up a new goblin war, though.
As you wish. Don't worry, the contract will be available whenever you're ready.
I knew you wouldn't be able to resist. Your target is a High Elf named Faelian. He lives somewhere in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks.
Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.
This contract will require a bit of detective work. I suggest you speak to your fellow Brothers and Sisters and see if they can offer any advice.
Ah yes, there is one more thing. The Imperial City is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named Adamus Phillida. Do you know who that is?
We'd been contracted to clear the place of trolls. It was a tough job, but I felt the men I sent were up to it. I want to know what happened.
Some contracts are straightforward. Find the target, eliminate them, then return to the Sanctuary. No time limits or complications.
However, many of our clients request that their contracts be carried out in a specific manner. A certain place, a certain method of elimination.
We try to honor these requests whenever possible. After all, the Dark Brotherhood's reputation has been built on providing... good service.
Any Brother or Sister who can complete a contract while following a specific request will receive a valuable bonus, oftentimes a powerful magic item.
The Black Hand is the Dark Brotherhood's ruling council. That hand consists of four Speakers and one Listener. Four fingers and a thumb, as it were.
This you already know. What is not commonly known among our family members is that the Black Hand employs a few... additional numbers.
As every hand has fingers, does not every finger have a nail? A claw? A talon? Every finger of the hand, every Speaker, has such a nail.
These are the Silencers. Each Speaker employs his or her own private assassin, to extend their reach and strike forth as necessary.
My previous Silencer perished while fulfilling a contract. That emptiness has now been filled by you. It is an honor without equal.
The Dark Brotherhood is an ancient organization. We have survived for millenia. Sometimes, to ensure that survival, drastic measures are required.
The Purification is one of the most extreme measures we are forced to carry out. Indeed, it has only been carried out twice. Before now, that is.
The Five Tenets are the laws that guide and protect us. But, sometimes, even they must be broken to protect the sanctity of our beliefs.
With a Purification, we cleanse the Dark Brotherhood of mistrust and treachery. Those who are slain are offered to Sithis as a symbol of fealty.
And, hopefully, we kill the traitor in the process. Until the Purification is complete, no given Sanctuary will ever be considered secure.
Oh... okay. Well... You get me some skooma, and then we'll... be good friends. Okay? Okay... Nordinor.. In Bravil... He sells it... Late at night...
You have skooma! Ha ha ha ha! Oh... Oh my friend! Yeah... You're my friend now! Thank you... Thank you!
Hey... Now that we're... we're friends... You want to come with me? To my... my special place? It's not... you know... very far...
If you want... come to... to Lorkmir's house. I go there every day. Every day. From 11:00 in the morning 'til 5:00 at night. I just go and... relax.
Lorkmir ain't... he ain't around no more. He he he... I use his house. Here's a key! For... for you! You come whenever you... you want! Okay then...
Oh... yeah... his house is in the... um... Elven Gardens District. So yeah... maybe I'll see you there... my new friend! He he. Goodbye... my friend!
Wait... You... You lied! Ohh... That's mean! Nordinor.. In Bravil... He sells skooma! Late at night... Go get me some... Okay?
Skooma! Oh! Oh, yeah... You want to... want to be my friend? I'll... I'll tell you what. Skooma's the only thing... the only thing I want...
You get me some... now listen up... sk...skooma. You know what that is? Get me some skooma and... and... we'll be good, good friends. Okay?
Do you ha... have any skooma now? Cause... I can be your friend ri... right now...
Oh! Oh... No... Not here! Not in the hotel! My lady friend... Atraena. She'll get mad! Wait 'til I'm away from... here. Outside the hotel... Yeah...
Skooma? Oh, yeah... Hey! You gave me some skooma! You are so... nice. Oh, yeah... You're such a good... friend.
The Inn lies north of Anvil. Speak with Arielle Jurard when you arrive. She will give you further instructions.
Do not let your guard down. We do not know whether the Inn's staff is involved somehow.
As you are new to the guild, and to the area, you are less likely to be recognized on your trip from Anvil to Kvatch.
You will pose as a traveling merchant, and will spend a night at the Inn, which is north of Anvil. After that, continue east along the road.
Speak with Arielle Jurard when you arrive. She will be, let's say, "assisting" you with your task.
You will find her company most welcome, I believe.
Faelian, you say? Why yes, I know who he is. Rather distasteful fellow, actually. I believe he lives right here, at the Tiber Septim Hotel.
Talk to the Publican, Augusta Calidia. I'm sure she can tell you more about him.
Faelian, you say? Why yes, I know who he is. Rather distasteful fellow, actually. I believe he lives at the Tiber Septim Hotel.
I do believe that establishment is right here in the Talos Plaza District. I'd ask around there, if I were you.
That's in the Talos Plaza District, here in the Imperial City. I'd ask around there, if I were you.
Faelian? Yes, I know who he is. But I'm really not in the habit of discussing such things with strangers...
Who? Faelian? I don't see how that's any business of yours at all. Really, the gall of some people!
Oh, just get away from me! My relationship with Faelian is none of your business!
Faelian? He... he's my sweet. My true love. But I don't know why I'm telling this to you. I mean, we hardly know each other and all...
Please, I... I don't mean to get emotional but... I feel I can trust you. I just don't know what to do about Faelian!
All he thinks about, all he cares about, is skooma! He was a fine young man once. But he's lost everything. His looks, his money... his self-respect.
I followed him a few times, to see where he goes. He walks around the city looking for skooma, and then goes to Lorkmir's house for several hours.
It's in the Elven Gardens District. I think the house is deserted. That's why he goes there. So he can escape from life and do his skooma!
Thank you for listening. You're a good friend. I just hope my sweet Faelian can clean himself up, or that awful skooma will be the death of him!
Faelian? Hey, that's my name! Yeah. I'm Faelian.
I might know him. I might not. I don't see how it's any of your business.
Yes, I know who Faelian is. Know quite a bit about him, actually. But... I probably shouldn't gossip. I mean, we hardly know each other...
Faelian? Oh, I know him all right! A waste of life, that one. He lives here you know, with his sweetheart, Atraena.
What that poor girl sees in him I'll never know. Atraena pays for their room, their food, everything. She's quite wealthy, I believe.
Faelian used to have money... used to be quite a gentleman, too. But that was before he took a fancy to the... you know. The skooma.
Now Faelian's hardly ever here. He's off using skooma, or wandering the city looking for some, I imagine.
He comes back every night to be with Atraena, but only for a few hours. I swear, that High Elf is going to wind up dead if he keeps living like this.
Really? I find being invisible quite refreshing.
But, if it will get everyone to leave me alone, fine. I did work out a counter-spell last week... if I can just put my hand to it... ah!
[Ancotar hands you a scroll.] Here. Stand in the center of town, to make sure you get everyone. Oh, and make sure... never mind. Should be fine.
Well... in a year or two. Maybe a bit more. There's no way to be absolutely sure. That's the exciting thing about basic research!
Oh... Really? Everyone in town?
That must have been what all the shouting was about a few weeks ago. I'm afraid I was engrossed in an experiment that required my full attention.
You see, in order to increase the efficacy of the spell, the radius was likely to approach the... never mind. I don't mean to bore you.
Yes, I have been working on a new invisibility spell. As you can see, it works quite well. Why?
I take no responsibility for your stupidity.
I am sorry about that. Just use the Reverse Invisibility scroll I gave you.
I'm glad to hear that the villagers aren't invisible anymore. It will make it easier for me to avoid them.
It's just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the ruins!
I say live and let live. It was an unfortunate accident, and he helped make it right.
Others in the village are not so forgiving, though. I don't blame him for keeping to himself.
We're pretty sure he's still hiding out in Fort Caractacus, although he never answers when we've tried to find him.
We haven't seen him since that whole invisibility mess. I hope it stays that way!
Typical Altmer. Thinks the whole world is made for his convenience.
If I had my way, we'd go down there and burn him out. Let him find some other place for his little "experiments."
If he's smart, he'll keep out of my way. High elf and a mage to boot, the worst kind of arrogance.
Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are elves. But self-important jerks like Ancotar give them all a bad name.
He's a wizard who took up residence in the ruins of Fort Caractacus a couple of years ago.
He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this.
We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder.
If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt.
Everyone in Aleswell suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now.
You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it.
So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience.
We're sure it was Ancotar's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.
I'm glad you were able to help them. I would have done it myself, but I like being invisible.
Besides, I don't know if they'd have been happy to see me.
It's your own fault. You had two chances to help them. I'm sure they'll get used to being invisible eventually.
A small settlement to the northwest of here, on the other side of the Silver Road to Bruma.
We've had travellers through recently that say it's turned into a ghost town. Everyone vanished without a trace.
Very well. Return to me when you are ready, and the contract is yours.
Excellent. Now listen closely. Nestled in the mountains to the west lies Fort Sutch. It is the home of the warlord Roderick and his mercenaries.
Roderick has recently taken ill. He now lies in eternal slumber, kept alive only by the daily administration of a powerful medicine.
You must infiltrate Fort Sutch, find Roderick's medicine, and replace it with a poisoned bottle I will provide. But you must remain undetected!
Whomever arranged this contract wants it to look like Roderick died from his illness, so discretion is essential. Attack no one! Be seen by no one!
If you are detected, the poisoning will fail, and Roderick must be killed in some other manner. That will, of course, forfeit your bonus.
Very well. If there's anything else I can do for you, let me know.
Right then. The bed is just upstairs, at the back of the inn. Sleep well.
I'm afraid that I can't rent you the room if you can't afford it. Sorry.
Of course. It's none of my business, is it?
I merely ask out of concern. If you're a merchant, you should be wary. There have been... problems recently.
Ah, yes. Thought so. We get many of them traveling through here. Well, we used to.
Haven't seen as many lately, what with the... well, you know. The murders.
I don't like to talk about it much, as it's bad for business. At any rate, would you care for a bed for the night?
Ah! How brave of you, to walk the roads with all of the recent trouble!
I myself have been here for some time, hoping to find out what's going on. No luck yet, though.
Well, you watch out for yourself, and be careful!
You've already rented a room. I'm sure there are no problems.
You want to stay here for a night, eh? Just for sleeping... you keep to yourself, mind your business, and stay away from my wife.
The room is 20 gold for the night. You want to stay or not?
The room's already yours for the night.
There's a bed for you if you need it. A mere 10 gold for the night.
I hope it's comfortable enough for you.
Are you interested? It's only 10 gold for the night.
Let me guess, traveling on business? You don't look like you're out for a stroll.
You've got the best room I can offer. If you start feeling ill for any reason, please consider shortening your stay.
Sleepy, are you? Be careful, you might be ill. Or dying. You never know...
If you insist on sleeping, there's a bed for 20 gold a night.
I hope you find the room to your liking.
There's never any charge for you, friend. Upstairs, first door on the left.
But you've already rented a room for the night.
I do have a bed available, for 10 gold a night. Would you like to rent it?
You've already got the use of the only beds I have. What more do you want?
It's not the nicest bed in Cyrodiil, but it's cheap. 10 gold, and it's yours for the night.
The room at the end of the hall upstairs is yours for the night. Dream well.
There's a fresh bed available to anyone who's got the 10 gold. Would you like it?
You've already got the room. It's down below deck.
There's a room, all right. And a fine room it is -- yours for the night for only 10 gold!
I hope you enjoy your stay.
There's a room free, all right. Best you'll find in Bravil, if I do say so. 20 gold, and it's yours for the night.
You've already rented the room.... Not much more to say, is there?
I do have a bed available, for 20 gold a night. Would you like to rent it?
You're already staying in one room, and I don't rent multiple rooms to a single customer.
Why, yes. I do have a lovely room available for a mere 40 gold a night. Are you interested?
I hope you sleep well.
If you've got 10 gold, I've got a room for the night. Deal?
I trust the room is satisfactory.
Need a place to rest? I have a room available, if you'd care to rent it for a night.
I have a lovely room on the corner, if you're interested. It's 20 gold for a night.
It's a wonderful room, isn't it?
I guess we've got a room available. 30 gold per night. Take it or leave it.
I don't give refunds.
Sure, friend, I've got a bed you can rent. It's upstairs at the end of the hall, last door on your right. Just 20 Gold. Sound good?
Did you find the room? Remember, upstairs at the end of the hallway. Last room on your right.
You have rented the only room I have for you.
A bed you seek? There is one here for you, if you have the 10 gold to rent it.
I have just the thing for you. A lovely suite on the second floor, for only 40 gold a night. Quite a steal. Interested?
You've already got the room for the night. There's nothing more I can offer.
There's a room, if you need it. 10 gold for the night.
There's one available for the night, if you're interested. It'll be 10 gold. What do you say?
I hope the accomodations are satisfactory.
You've already got a room. Nothin' more I can get for you.
There's a bed, of a sort. It ain't much, but it gets the job done. 10 gold a night if you're interested.
The bed is quite luxurious, is it not?
There's a most comfortable bed just downstairs. A wonderful room, and nicely priced at 25 gold a night, if you're interested.
Hope it suits you.
I've got a room, and a cheap one at that. You looking for one?
I have a room ready, if you need it for the night. It'll be 10 gold. Interested?
A bed? Well of course! Of course! I've got a small room available right upstairs, first door on the left. Only 10 gold. What do you say?
You find the room okay? Right at the top of the stairs. First one on the left. You really can't miss it.
You've got what 10 gold will buy you. I never said it'd be a palace.
Yeah, I've got a room. 10 gold for the night. You sure you want it?
You need someplace to rest? I can rent you a room for the night for 10 gold.
The bed's comfortable, right?
I hope the room meets your needs.
Yes, there's a room available. It'll cost 15 gold for the night. Are you interested?
I presume you're satisfied with the room.
There's a wonderful room available. It's the best I have, and you can use it for the night for a mere 25 gold. Interested?
The room at the end of the hall upstairs is yours for the night, just like we agreed.
Aye, there's a bed free if you need it. It'll be 10 gold for the night. What do you say?
I think I may have figured out the hidden message in Mankar Camoran's books! Do you have the third and fourth volumes with you?
I turned up copies of the first two volumes from my colleagues, and I spent a little time rereading them.
Mankar Camoran certainly is a fascinating writer. Undoubtedly insane, but fascinating.
Ah, but more to the point, it appears to me that the first words of each paragraph may be significant. A message may be hidden there.
I'll continue to study the problem. Come by tomorrow if you like. I may think of something else.
To find their secret shrine to Mehrunes Dagon, you'll need to study the four volumes of Mankar Camoran's "Commentaries."
It is a fairly common practice of these kinds of esoteric cults to put hidden messages within their sacred writings.
In effect, simply by finding their way to the shrine, prospective members have already passed the first test on the road to "enlightenment."
You've piqued my curiousity about this puzzle. I will think on it myself and let you know if I have any ideas.
Check back with me tomorrow after I've given this matter some thought.
You know of them? One of the most secretive of all the daedric cults. Not much is known about them.
They follow the teachings of Mankar Camoran, whom they call the Master. A shadowy figure in his own right.
They worship the daedra lord Mehrunes Dagon, according to the teachings of their leader, Mankar Camoran.
No one knows how widespread the cult is, or where their shrine to Mehrunes Dagon is located.
Is that who they were? All I know is that they intended to sacrifice me to their dark god. If only I could erase the memory of that hellish place.
A secretive cult devoted to the Daedra Lord Mehrunes Dagon, the Prince of Destruction.
They follow the teachings of Mankar Camoran, who calls for the return of the Mythic Age when Oblivion and the mortal world were not separate.
The usual daedric claptrap of the purifying power of Destruction. They hope to bring Mehrunes Dagon back to Tamriel and give us all a good Cleansing.
You should keep working on getting a hold of those other Mythic Dawn books. That's our best lead right now.
They'll pay for the murder of the Emperor. Now that we know who they are, it's only a matter of time.
I'm glad it was you that put them down. My only regret is that I wasn't there with you.
Ancotar gave you a scroll to get rid of the invisibility? Fantastic! What are you waiting for?
Yes, just read the scroll in the middle of town. It should work... although...
Just in case, it might be best if you wore this ring while you were casting the spell. I make them myself. Very useful for this kind of research.
Not that I think anything will go wrong. Serious side effects are highly unlikely.
Don't forget to wear that ring I gave you when you cast the spell. Not that there's anything to worry about.
What do you mean you need another one? I believe the instructions were very clear: stand in the middle of Aleswell and read the scroll.
Hard to believe that anyone could find that too complicated. Lucky for you, I made a backup scroll. Here. But I don't want to see you again.
You wasted it again, didn't you? It is truly pathetic that the fools in Aleswell actually trusted you to save them.
Now get out of my sight before I make you sorry you meddled in my affairs.
I've already given you the scroll. Stand in the middle of town, read it, poof! It is exactly like magic.
You can tell them not to worry, the effect is not actually permanent. It should wear off eventually.
Ah, a fellow mage! Please excuse my rudeness earlier. I find most people extremely tedious. Completely ignorant of the arcane.
I came out here to get some privacy for my research. Instead, I was constantly bothered by the local peasantry!
The explosions are scaring the sheep or "A plague of rats ate all our crops." Every day another complaint!
No understanding of the pitfalls of experimental magic! Finally, I decided that permanent invisibility was the only way to get some peace and quiet.
I know! You're about to quote Vanto's Third Law... don't worry! I have not actually found a way to violate the Conservation of Perception!
The invisibility is not actually permanent. You can tell the villagers not to worry, it will wear off eventually.
Oh, I'm sorry. Perhaps I heard incorrectly. Excuse me.
Don't you worry, what with the recent killings and all? I'd be ever so scared, if it were me. I haven't left the Inn in days, just in case!
Well, you take care of yourself. I'd hate to hear about another senseless death. Good luck to you!
Fine. Your loss though, isn't it? Can't get that recommendation you need.
That's the spirit!
You help me pull off a little prank, and I'll help you find J'skar.
Why doesn't the Elder Council send the Legion to help us? There's no telling when another Oblivion Gate will open!
Leyawiin stands alone. That's what Count Caro says. Only our brave Guardsmen to keep the hordes of Oblivion at bay.
So much dirt, and so little time... pause but a moment, and you'll be drowned in the tide... Trash! Mud! Dust!
We all love Count Marius, and his father before him... Arkay bless his soul... such a fine young man...
... And now, his new wife, so beautiful, so fine. And wise? Oh, yes! The new Lady Leyawiin is daughter to Countess Arriana Valga, County Chorrol...
... and so she knows just how the county should be run.  Lady Alessia tells Count Marius exactly what to do... and he does as she says...
... But listen to me! Cawing and chattering like an old fishcrow...
I make all the weapons and armor for the guard. Damn good stuff. Pop you open like a ripe melon.
Leyawiin has always been a melting pot of races and cultures. Of course, racial and cultural conflicts produce inefficiencies and confusion...
I fear Lady Leyawiin and Hlidara Mothril plan to push the minorities aside and establish a bland, Imperial-dominated culture here in Leyawiin.
Want to hear a Khajiit joke?
My duties are primarily... administrative. They keep me busy here in the Leyawiin barracks.
Here I train our skirmishing specialists. You know, perhaps, that Argonians may be gifted spellcasters.
We, of course, have no use for the specialized skills of assassination. It is my task, instead, to train our agents in various aspects of stealth.
Gods are my witness! I give that man the simplest list of things to do, and somehow he forgets half of it and gets the rest wrong.
There are things I like to do. Does this never occur to her? Does she think I live each minute to run her errands for her?
She wonders why she cannot find me? Doesn't it occur to her? That I am hiding from her?
Have you SEEN all the rats around here? It's making me CRAZY. First, this guy decides he's gonna make a million, opens a fancy restaurant.
Rats in a Cream Sauce. Rat Flambe. Rat Necrom, with Bone Meal Gravy. Deep Fried Rat. Lemon Rat and Wild Rice. Rat Ragu, with Powdered Deer Penis!
Of course, when the Guard found out, they ran his sorry butt right out of town. But they left the rats! RATS!!!
Maybe Weebam-Na told you how we got all the rats here in Leyawiin? It's not so bad. He's been killing them for months.
Okay, okay! I'll tell you! It is so great! I sneak into people's houses, take things off their tables and shelves, and put them into barrels!
Hahaha! Isn't that rich? They think the things are stolen, but no! They are right there! They just don't know!
We are from Leyawiin.
I used to be a priest of the Tribunal Temple in Kragenmoor. After the collapse, I drifted for a while, until I joined the Chapel.
The beggars and the wicked Thieves Guild still trouble me. I wish the Nine Divines offered charity and comfort to the poor like the Temple did.
The Leyawiin chapter is just drifting along. Dagail isn't much of a mentor or leader. She isn't even coherent most of the time.
My neighbors grumble a lot, but what can they do? No law against practicing my skills.
Thinking about sticking your paw in my pocket? Go ahead. I'll blow you to cream corn, and the Law will love me for it.
Leyawiin is in a state of transition. It has long been a respected county making moderate cultural and economic contributions to the Empire.
However, Leyawiin must move towards the mainstream of Imperial culture, both in trade and in political affairs.
Our only hope to weather this Oblivion invasion is to defend our walls and be damned to what happens outside them.
Guard stays inside the city walls for the duration of the crisis. Count Caro's orders. We're not going to risk another Kvatch here.
Weebam-Na and Bejeen have been bragging about some big score they made recently. They claim it's a valuable jewel. Who knows with those two.
You can speak to the Count near the throne weekdays between eight in the morning and four in the afternoon.
Orc named Mazoga says she's a knight. I doubt it. The Count wants it looked into. Why don't you talk to him?
The Count appears for audiences in the County Hall near the throne weekdays between 8 AM and 4 PM.
May you find healing here for your wounds, and for your troubled spirit. There's a peace here in the Chapel for all who seek it.
I believe in the transforming power of honest work. I honor your vocation as adventurer. By your labors and their fruits, you praise Zenithar.
I am proud of my family's tradition of service to Leyawiin and its people. We face many challenges, but Gods willing, we shall prevail.
In these difficult times, we must count on persons such as you to secure our borders from bandits and rabble-rousers.
We all profit by your lawful pursuit of the unlawful, and we encourage you to attack, burn, loot, and destroy them wherever you can.
I came to Leyawiin after a tour in the Legions. Poor Mother. She hoped I'd choose the chapel or civil service, or perhaps even marry well.
I've lived in Leyawiin all my life, and I must say, the Count has found himself a pretty little bride...and a smart one, too.
We need some law-and-order... bring in the Legions. 'Leyawiin for the Imperials,' I say. No sense coddling those Renrijra Krin bandits.
Well, I don't know much about politics, but I think Lady Alessia's right. We've got to put a stop to all these bandits and rabble in the Trans-Niben.
I know the Khajiit are all upset that the Council took away their land and gave it to us, but they just have to get over it! It's our land, now.
Well, stranger, anyone ever tell you the story of Torval the Pilot, the High Elf who discovered the Niben? The patron saint of Leyawiin?
I'm the Count's man's-man in all occasions... have been for donkey's years. I run the Count's errands and do whatever's required.
Januarius and I have been in service to three generations of Caros. We're very proud of Count Marius and his lovely new bride.
Everyone in town knows about my hobby... collecting unusual examples of the arcane crafts. My husband left me quite comfortable, bless his cinders.
What will I do with my collection of curiosities when I go? Donate them to the Castle, of course.
Did you hear about the Blackwood Company? They were all mad murderers hopped up on hist? And crooked, thieving frauds?
They're gone now. Fighters Guild took care of them. And about time the Guild showed some sand. They are 'fighters', aren't they?
People are beginning to have second thoughts about the Blackwood Company after the Azani Blackheart hoax.
Sounds like they were in it with Blackheart. As folks learn more about the Blackwood Company's methods, they aren't so eager to hire them.
Blackwood Company is putting the Fighters Guild to shame. They're a new mercenary company, competing with the guild.
Beast people and other savages. Work cheap and fast. "No job too tough." Not fussy, either. Fighters Guild better watch out...
It's a pretty town, and everyone is really friendly, except maybe some Khajiit and Argonians who are upset about the Trans-Niben.
I think it's a shame how they took that land from Elsweyr, and Argonians are afraid it could happen to them, too.
I cook here. And live here. With Shuravi and Shamada. We're sisters. Three. Shuravi - one. Shamada - two. And me - three.
I have been happy enough in the Count's service. But I am not so happy about his lovely wife, and her Nibenean advisor.
Lady Alessia is uncomfortable with Khajiit ways. And Argonian ways. And Dunmer ways. She is only comfortable with pure white-bread Nibeneans.
I am the best alchemist in Leyawiin. But if you need Advanced Training, you'll need Brotch Calus in Bruma or Ardaline in Bravil.
Some clown keeps tossing meat out in my backyard, and it attracts dogs from Necrom to Daggerfall.
The Blackwood Company is proud of our beastfolk heritage, and we are solely owned and operated by Khajiit and Argonians.
We speak West-fashion for the comfort of our Western clients, but we invest the fierce pride of our ancient races in each of our mercenary contracts.
'Blackwood' refers in part to Blackwood Forest, but it also carries a reference to the 'thoghatt', of 'charcoal warriors' of Khajiit tradition.
So many greenskins here... they smell, do they not? Ahdarji won't drink the water, no. The Argonians SWIM in it.
You will not stay in Leyawiin. You just visit. Of course. Too many Argonians here. Already. People here don't like Argonians. Too many already.
I take care of what little administrative work there is. Dagail isn't interested. I do it because it has to be done, and no one else wants to do it.
I'm sure there's an abundance of exotic ingredients to be gathered nearby. In Blackwood, for example, or along the Niben.
I think it's a disgrace that Argonians can swagger around Leyawiin, boasting how they whupped this Khajitt silly, and beat that Khajjit to a pulp.
I think it's a disgrace that Khajjit can swagger around Leyawiin, boasting how they whupped this Argonian silly, and beat that Argonian to a pulp.
I like Leyawiin. That Count got you to help me. Damn nice. Both of you. Think I'll stick around. Maybe do some good deeds here.
I am SICK of Orcs coming in here and giving me the business. 'Ooh. Bugak got a book store. Ooh. Bugak's a sissy scroll-scribbler!'
If you need a blade, go see Tun-Zeeus at the Dividing Line. Does repairs, too. He does go on and on, sometimes. But he's the Genuine Orc in Leyawiin.
Best prices? Right here at Gundalas' Best Goods and Guarantees! Never an unhappy customer! Huge discounts... to qualifying patrons!
Blackwood Company's a problem. Not for me. I mostly do training. But we don't see many contracts in Leyawiin guildhall. Blackwood gets them all.
Well, you sorted out the Blackwood boys, all right. Nice work. Now maybe we'll see a little more guild contract work here in Leyawiin.
Let me see your hand. I see the City in the Hand, and the Hand in the Stars.
The Tower guards the Gate, but the Gate holds the Key.
The King is the Key, and the Hand guards the King.
There's crime everywhere! I'm always on the lookout... ehr... WE're always on the lookout. No crime shall go undetected! That's our motto.
Very well. Take your time.
Oh my. I feel terrible that I even suspected anyone within my court. I was hoping to recover the painting, so I might look upon it again.
I suppose you did the best you could, so you should not go unrewarded. Take this gold, and leave me in peace.
I am shocked to hear of Chanel's crime, as she has always been such a nice member of our court, but I see that your evidence is without question.
She shall be banished from Castle Chorrol and stripped of her duties. However, I am not without pity, and therefore she shall not be jailed.
But she is never to set foot in Chorrol again. I am a bit dismayed that you incorrectly accused Orgnolf, who was clearly innocent.
I therefore can only reward you with this gold, and hopefully you will learn to be more careful with your accusations in the future.
But she is never to set foot in Chorrol again. Congratulations on a job well done.
As a reward, please accept this bounty of gold and gems. You've earned it.
Chanel? I find that very hard to believe. Until you obtain a full confession from her, I cannot accept your accusation.
Very well. Then I must find someone else who can. I will do nothing else until that painting is recovered.
Very well, I suggest you begin to gather clues. And I warn you: do not accuse the wrong person, or I shall be quite cross with you.
Here are some keys. They should allow you access to many of the restricted areas in Castle Chorrol.
You seem the trusting type. Perhaps you can assist me?
It seems someone has taken away an heirloom that is quite dear to me. I want you to help me recover a stolen painting.
The painting was of my lost love, the Count Valga, and it has been stolen from my bedchamber.
If you find the painting, and bring the culprit to justice, you shall be justly rewarded. What say you?
Please help me recover the painting of the Count. It would mean so very much to me.
I'm sorry, but the investigation is a secret, and I don't trust you enough to discuss it with you.
So, the Countess hired you to find the painting, eh? Well, you'll not find it by gawking at me.
You have your "criminal." Congratulations.
Yes, I have heard that the painting of the Count was taken. I was unaware she hired an outsider to conduct the investigation. May luck be with you.
Your best bet is to speak to residents of the castle. Once you have found out all you can, search for physical clues.
I was elsewhere at the time of the robbery, and the chamber was locked.
The only other people who had access to the chamber and were unaccounted for are the court mage, Chanel and the porter Orgnolf.
Don't forget to check with Bittneld, the Captain of the Guard, my Steward, Orok gro-Ghoth and my herald, Laythe Wavrick.
My duties rely on watching no more than the throne and attending to visitors.
But confidentially, I will say that Orgnolf has been acting a bit unusal. His abuse of drink has gotten worse lately.
He has taken to asking for money from others to purchase spirits. A porter's wage does not befit his habit.
I was with the Countess all evening. Didn't see a thing.
The night of the theft, I was in the Great Hall, having an argument with a delivery boy from Bravil.
It seems his horse lost its footing in the heavy rain we had that night and the shipment of port that it was carrying slipped to the ground.
The fall broke most of the bottles. He didn't want to claim responsibility, but I gave him what for and sent him away.
After that, I spent the rest of the night in my quarters... reading.
Who do you think you are questioning me? I'd just assume ask a goblin maiden to a dance then to answer your stupid questions.
I'm sorry, I wasn't in that evening. I was making my rounds of Chorrol.
The only odd occurrence lately was with Chanel. I have seen her spending a lot of time in the West Tower.
When I asked her about it, she said it involved her spell research. I suppose at the time it sounded good enough for me.
Hmmmm. I don't remember seeing Chanel or Orgnolf that entire evening.
But then again, I stayed in my quarters most of the night. There was no point in going on my usual walk with all of the rain falling.
As far as Chanel and Orgnolf go, they seem fine to me. I only had a minor scrape with Orgnolf recently.
I caught him drinking in the West Tower on the upper level. I told him if he didn't stop, I would tell the Countess. He just grumbled and agreed.
He hasn't bothered me since.
I don't trust you enough to reveal details about the castle to you.
I was careless to leave my art supplies around the castle like I did. I suppose I was easy to discover.
The night that the painting was stolen, I was in the courtyard of the castle taking star readings.
After a while, I decided to go into the dining area just off the Great Hall.
I poured myself some wine and studied the charts I had made until it was time to sleep.
From there, I went directly to my chamber and slept the rest of the night.
I am sorry. I don't really feel comfortable talking with you about that night. I barely know you.
When you find enough evidence, confront the person whom you believe to be the villain, and see if they will confess.
I do not wish them harmed, as I want the thief to face justice.
Have you taken leave of your senses? We already covered this! Now go away!
Look me in the eye when you answer this. You dare accuse me?
We have already been through this, and I admitted my guilt.
Are you accusing me of taking the painting?
The painting of the Count once again sits in its rightful place.
The painting is all I have left that reminds me of the Count.
I spend many a lonely night wishing that the words I speak to it will be heard and not just fall upon the lifeless pigments and canvas.
Well, I suppose I should congratulate you on returning the painting to the Countess. I won't.
Aye, it was a fine portrait of a fine man.
The painting will reside with me for the rest of my days as a reminder of the man I once loved.
I am ashamed that I took the painting, but my love for the Count was greater than you could imagine.
The stolen painting was of Count Valga. Whoever painted it could not do the man justice.
He was kind and noble, which is difficult to convey on canvas. I am afraid other than that, I cannot offer much more information.
I do. I did. And I won't say it again. But, that's enough about that. You're the ruler of Mania! Just look at you. You're positively beaming!
You now have the power to summon Golden Saints. They've always served the Duke of Mania. I think it's the bright colors. They just love 'em.
She's a wilderness guide we hired to lead our expedition to Cropsford. Saved our lives when the goblins attacked.
My father hired her as a guide at an inn south of here. Good thing, too. She saved our lives, and led us safely back here after the goblin attack.
We plan to call it Cropsford. My daugher Callia, her husband Aloys, and I, came all the way from High Rock to start a new life here.
We have a charter from the county, everything done official and by the book.
I'm sure now that they knew all along that the land was in goblin territory. But no matter, who cares if a few settlers get themselves killed?
I won't forget your service to our new settlement. Who knows? One day Cropsford may be a thriving town, and all because of you.
We're almost ready to start planting crops. Cropsford is really starting to feel like home.
I'm happy with our progress so far. I feel better knowing that Callia and Aloys have a home again.
Come back in a few weeks. You may be surprised at what we can accomplish.
Our little farm is thriving. We couldn't have done it without your help. Come back and visit us anytime.
What do you think about our new home? It's smaller than our old house back in High Rock, but we built it with our own hands.
I can't thank you enough for your help! You gave us another chance at a new life.
It's northwest of here along the Yellow Road. You'll see some of our supplies near the road where we left them when the goblins attacked.
It was my father's dream, for us all to start a new life there. He spent everything he had to buy the land. Now it all seems to be ruined.
I like it here. I really didn't think I would, but Cropsford feels like home now. Thanks for making this possible, my friend.
I'm starting to think this is going to work. Maybe Barthel wasn't crazy to bring us here after all.
I guess we won't be going back to High Rock after all. Cropsford is going to be our home now, for better or worse.
If you ask Barthel, it's the garden spot of Tamriel. See for yourself. It's just northwest of here. But watch out for the goblins.
Follow the Yellow Road northwest from here. You'll see the supplies they had to abandon when the goblins attacked.
Oh. That's a shame. I don't see how three farmers can fight a whole tribe of goblins, but I'm sure we'll figure something out.
I had a good feeling about you, friend. You should talk to Mirisa about the goblins. She's our guide and knows what needs to be done.
Watch out for them if you're heading north. We ran into goblin war parties northwest of here, while starting to build a new settlement.
My family and I are still trying to figure out what to do. We spent everything we had to buy the land and supplies, so we can hardly go back.
Say, do you think you could help us? We need to get the goblins off our land so we can start building our new settlement.
Yep, we're in a real predicament. Do you think you might be able to help us by getting rid of the goblins on our land?
Have you made any progress? Is it safe for us to go to Cropsford yet?
Everything was going well. We had set up camp at Cropsford, and it looked like a beautiful spot. Then the goblins attacked.
Thank Y'ffre that Mirisa was there! Without her, the goblins would have surely killed us all.
We had just set up at Cropsford when Mirisa came running in. Said goblins were heading our way. We barely escaped with our lives!
You've agreed to help them clear the goblins from Cropsford? That's great news!
I've done some scouting around while we've been camped here, and it looks like Cropsford is right in the middle of a goblin war.
The caves around here are infested with goblins. Normally goblins stay close to their lairs, and wouldn't be a huge problem.
But two tribes are at war, and their war parties are crossing right through Cropsford. What you'll need to do is stop the war somehow.
That's right! They managed to close the castle gates just before we were forced in here.
I'm afraid you're in for a tough time, friend. The city's in bad shape, and it will be difficult to make it to the Guard House by yourself.
I'd better go with you. We'll have to go through the Chapel Undercroft, and then through what's left of the city.
If.... If I don't make it, take the key and carry on without me. You need to reach the tower at the north wall of the city.
Hrmph. You do the guard one little favor, and suddenly you think you're Matius' best friend?
You probably couldn't find it on your own. I'm coming with you. If we make it, I'll open the door for you.
I've still got some fight left in me.
Yes, I have it. Why?
Someone has to get inside that gatehouse, and raise the gate. We'll never make it into the castle otherwise.
I need to stay with the guards. They won't do well without a strong leader. And I can't trust any of them to make it through the city on their own.
I guess that leaves you, doesn't it?
Go back to the Chapel, and talk to Berich Inian. Ask him for the key to the North Tower, and he'll tell you what you need to do.
If you make it, we'll be waiting right outside the gate for you.
I go to my grave. A tongue shriller than all the music calls me.
You shall follow me yet for a while, then we must part.
No trophies of my triumphs precede me. But I have lived well, and my ghost shall rest easy.
Men are but flesh and blood. They know their doom, but not the hour.
In this I am blessed to see the hour of my death...
... To face my apportioned fate, then fall.
My dreams grant me no opinions of success. Their compass ventures not beyond the doors of death.
But in your face, I behold the sun's companion. The dawn of Akatosh's bright glory may banish the coming darkness.
With such hope, and with the promise of your aid, my heart must be satisfied.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Mage shall light your way on the paths of glory.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Apprentice shall serve you at the forge of destiny.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Atronach shall aid you with your appointed burden.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Ritual shall speed you on your star-patterned path.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Warrior shall prove a stalwart companion when fortune fades.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Steed shall speed your progress on the road to destiny.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Lady shall fortify you in your quest for glory.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Lord shall prove a faithful patron in your quest for glory.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Thief shall guide your steps on the road to destiny.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Lover shall sweeten your journey as you confront your fate.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Shadow shall hide you from destiny's cunning hounds.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Tower shall prove a stout refuge in time of need.
Your stars are not mine. Today the Serpent shall sting the foes who seek your blood.
I've served the Nine all my days, and I chart my course by the cycles of the heavens.
The skies are marked with numberless sparks, each a fire, and every one a sign.
I know these stars well, and I wonder... which sign marked your birth?
Then go. Take with you my blessings and the hope of the empire.
Remember me, and remember my words. This burden is now yours alone. You hold our future in your hands.
Stand true, my friend. May your heart be your guide and the gods grant you strength.
For me, it ends here. You are our only hope to stem the blood tide. Give me your hand.
The Amulet of Kings. It is the Empire's sacred emblem of rulership.
It must pass to the last of the Dragon's Blood. Keep it safe from the pawns of the Destroyer.
This is where my journey ends. For you though, the road is long and dangerous. Now, give me your hand.
Hey, lizard! It must break your heart, huh? Being so close to the water, knowing you'll never get to swim again...
You know, sometimes, when they let us in the yard, you can hear the sounds from the lake. The boats, the gulls. So close...
No, you'll never get to swim again, Argonian. But don't worry, you'll be dead soon enough. That's right. You're going to die in here!
Hey, you hear that? The guards are coming... for you!  He he he he he.
Wake up, kitty kitty. That's it. There's a rat in my cell, Khajiit. A fat, tasty rat. Does the kitty want it? Is the kitty hungry?
You'd better take whatever you can get in here, Khajiit. They don't feed the new prisoners. Didn't you know that?
First they starve you. Then they beat you. Then, if you're lucky, they kill you. That's right. You're going to die in here!
My, my, you're a big one. A Nord, I'd guess, right? So strong... But you can't bend steel, can you boy? You can't do anything to get out of here.
And those big muscles? They're going to waste away. When the end comes, you won't even have the strength to cry for your mother.
That's right. You're going to die in here. You hear me, Nord? You're going to die in here!
Oooh, aren't you a fair lass. Your skin is so pale, so pure. And your body is so... strong. Let me guess. A Nord, right?
I bet you think you're pretty tough, huh? I bet you can swing a sword and everything. Well, it doesn't matter! Not in here. It does no good to fight.
But don't worry. The guards always treat the pretty ones nice. Right 'til the end. Oh, that's right. You're going to die in here, Nord!
Wake up, Redguard! Ah, there you are. How do you like your cell, huh? Roomy enough for you?
Wake up, pretty Redguard! Ah, there you are. How do you like your cell, huh? Roomy enough for you?
I can't even imagine what it's like for you. No more sunshine, no more open seas. Just a box and a dirty beam of light for the rest of your life.
Bet you're glad it won't last long, huh? Oh, didn't you know? No one ever leaves this prison alive! You're going to die in here, Redguard! Die!
Oh, look, an Imperial in the Imperial Prison. I guess they don't play favorites, huh? Your own kinsmen think you're a piece of human trash. How sad.
I bet the guards give you "special" treatment before the end. Oh, that's right. You're going to die in here, Imperial! You're going to die!
Imperial criminal scum like you give the Empire a bad name, you see. You're an embarrassment. Best if you just... disappeared.
Pale skin, snotty expression. You're a Breton! The masters of magicka, right? Hmph. Nothing but a bunch of stuck-up snobs with cheap parlor tricks.
Pale skin, snotty expression. You're a Breton! The masters of magicka, right? Hmph. You're nothing but a stuck-up harlot with cheap parlor tricks.
Go ahead, try your magicka in here. Let's see you make those bars disappear. No? What's the matter? Not so powerful now, are you Breton?
You're not leaving this prison 'til they throw your body in the lake. Oh, that's right. You're going to die in here, Breton! You're going to die!
Hey, there! You! Kinsman! I haven't seen another Dunmer in here in I don't know how long. Where you from, huh? Vvardenfell?
You got a wife back home? Tell you what. I'm getting out of here in a couple of weeks. When I get back to Morrowind I'll look her up.
She must be so lonely. Don't you worry, eh? I'll take care of her long after you're dead. Oh, that's right. You're going to die in here!
I must surely be dead, and in the halls of Azura to look upon such a vision. You are so beautiful, my dear Dunmer maiden...
One of the guards owes me a favor, you know. I could get us put in the same cell. Would you like that? You should have some fun before the end.
Yeah, you heard me. No matter what the law says. No matter what they told you. You're going to die in here! You're going to die!
Hey! Wood Elf! You're a little far from the forest, huh? Looks like your days of woodland frolicking have come to a tragic end.
Well now, a pretty little Wood Elf. You're a little far from the forest, huh? Looks like your days of woodland frolicking have come to a tragic end.
To go from the gladed realm of Valenwood to a rat-infested hole like this... how very sad. Those walls must feel like they're closing in on you.
Pretty soon you'll go mad, and the guards will cut your throat just to stop the ranting. That's right. You're going to die in here, Wood Elf! Die!
Well, well, look at the high and mighty Altmer. Where's your dignity now, huh? Where's that famous High Elf poise and bearing?
Well, well, look at the elegant Altmer maiden. Where's your dignity now, huh? Where's that famous High Elf poise and bearing?
You know, my time's almost up. Pretty soon I'll be free, and you'll still be stuck in this rat hole, waiting for your execution.
That's right. I heard some of the guards talking. You're going to die in here, "High" Elf! You hear me? You're going to die in here!
By the Nine Divines, you're an ugly one. But then, all Orcs are ugly. The most repulsive race in all of Tamriel, really.
By the Nine Divines, you're an ugly one. And female, no less. But then, all Orcs are ugly. The most repulsive race in all of Tamriel, really.
At least you've got that brutish strength, huh? Must be nice to just rip someone apart like some kind of monster.
At least you've got that brutish strength, huh? Who needs pretty when you can just rip someone apart like some kind of monster.
Oh, but you must be the one Orc weakling, huh? Captured by Imperials. How pathetic. You're going to die in here, Orc! Like an animal in a cage!
Baurus! Lock that door behind us!
We don't know that, Sire. The messenger only said they were attacked.
My job right now is to get you to safety.
Yes, your Majesty. Beneath the Legion Compound. We're headed for a secret passage known only to the Blades. No one can follow us through here.
What's this prisoner doing here? This cell is supposed to be off-limits.
Never mind. Get that gate open.
Stand back, prisoner. We won't hesitate to kill you if you get in our way.
Good. Let's go. We're not out of this yet.
Please, sire, we must keep moving.
Better not close this one. There's no way to open it from the other side.
Stranger, you chose a bad day to take up with the cause of the Septims.
The Amulet of Kings will be mine.
You thought your secrets could be hidden from the Lord of Destruction?
You thought the last Septim heir was safe from us?
With this blade I have severed the Septim line forever.
You may slay me, but we have already won.
The proof of your defeat lies there bleeding on the floor.
The age of the Septims is over, fool. A new age is dawning!
When my Lord walks the earth, you shall know that our victory is complete.
My sons ... they're dead, aren't they?
No, they're dead. I know it.
I know this place ... the prison?
Usual mixup with the Watch, I ...
How could they be waiting for us here?
They won't be the first to underestimate the Blades.
I'll take point. Let's move.
We should find a defensible spot and protect the Emperor until help arrives.
Have you seen the prisoner?
I know he did.
I know she did.
Sire, we have to go now.
Your Majesty, we need to keep moving.
Please, sire. We can't stay here. We have to go.
Not yet. Let me rest a moment longer.
Dammit, it's that prisoner again! Kill him, he might be working with the assassins.
Dammit, it's that prisoner again! Kill her, she might be working with the assassins.
No. He is not one of them.
No. She is not one of them.
He can help us. He must help us.
She can help us. She must help us.
As you wish, sire.
Come closer. I'd prefer not to have to shout.
I need your help. Please come with us.
Don't be afraid. My guardians will not harm you.
Dammit! The gate is barred from the other side. A trap!
Worth a try. Let's go!
I don't know. I don't see any good options here.
They're behind us! Wait here, sire.
Yessir.
No sign of pursuit, sir.
Don't know. But it's too late to go back now.
Don't worry, sire, we will get you out of here.
Help? What makes you think help will get here before more of those bastards? We need to get the Emperor out of here.
I think that was all of them. Let me take a look around.
Do you think he followed us? How could he?
Do you think she followed us? How could she?
What about that side passage back there?
It's a dead end. What's your call, sir?
Wait here with the Emperor. Guard him with your life.
Listen well, child. No longer will you receive orders directly. Instead, you will visit dead drop locations scattered throughout Cyrodiil.
Your next contract can be found at the dead drop on Hero Hill, southeast of here. A hollow in the moss-covered rock contains all you need to know.
When you leave here, we will not speak again, unless I deem it necessary. Ah yes, there is one last thing. I have for you a very special gift.
Waiting just outside is a magnificent steed named Shadowmere. She has served me well. I present her now to you, as a token of my trust and love.
Now go, and may Sithis guide you in this new stage of your life's dark journey.
It is quite simple, really. No longer will you receive orders directly. Instead, you will visit dead drop locations scattered throughout Cyrodiil.
Hail Sithis indeed, my child! Now listen closely. No longer will you receive your orders directly. Instead, you will visit secret dead drops.
Listen well, child of Sithis. You have been chosen to perform the ancient rite known as Purification. Everyone inside the Sanctuary must die!
You must break one of the Tenets you have sworn to uphold. I know this is an unexpected turn of events, but drastic measures must be taken.
Ocheeva, Vicente Valtieri, Antoinetta Marie, Gogron gro-Bolmog, Telaendril, M'raaj-Dar and Teinaava. All of these family members must die!
From this point forward, you are no longer bound by the Five Tenets! Sithis will forgive any murder, any theft, so long as you serve the Black Hand!
When the rite of Purification has been completed, return to me here at Fort Farragut, and we will discuss your future.
Now, take these special gifts. They will help you greatly. One is a poisoned apple. The other, a unique scroll of summoning. Good luck... Silencer.
Oh, but I do. You have been selected by the Black Hand to perform the ancient rite known as Purification. Everyone inside the Sanctuary must die!
And that, dear child, is why the Black Hand has chosen you to perform the ancient rite known as Purification. Everyone inside the Sanctuary must die!
Listen well, my child! The Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is an enchanted arrow that will kill Phillida... instantly!
As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted.
Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis!
Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message!
Once Phillida is dead, sever his finger, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring!
Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Yes! Yes! The Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is an enchanted arrow that will kill Phillida... instantly!
The Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida.
Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring!
Go and see for yourself! Kvatch is a smoking ruin! We're all that's left, do you understand me? Everyone else is dead!
Gods' blood, you don't know, do you?
Daedra overran Kvatch last night! There were glowing portals outside the walls! Gates to Oblivion itself!
There was a huge creature... something out of a nightmare... came right over the walls... blasting fire. They swarmed around it... killing...
What little we know makes no sense in a larger context.
For example, why was Falcar -- who we know now to be part of this cult of Necromancers -- in possession of Black Soul Gems?
The Arch-Mage has other reports of these gems being associated with Necromancers, but we do not know why. We don't even know what they do.
We have overlooked these questions because we are so focused on rooting out the Necromancers as quickly as possible.
I'd like you to speak with Tar-Meena at the Mystic Archives. She is our specialist on magicka arcana, and has been helping gather information.
I believe we have been asking her the wrong questions, taxing her too much with vague attempts to make sense of all that we know.
Speak with her specifically about these Black Soul Gems. If she knows anything about their powers or creation.
An insight into their origins may lead us to those who are responsible for them.
I don't know why Denel is even trying. This is doomed to fail.
But fine. If he wants it, he can have it. It's just one more thing I'll get blamed for in the end.
Now that I have the book, I can try and translate what's on the walls here. You just read the inscriptions, and let me know what they say.
You got the book, eh? Good for you. I've given up trying to deal with her for now.
I'll tell you what. I'll take the book, and then if you can read me the inscriptions, I'll see if I can find translations for them.
I don't know. Anything that might help explain these inscriptions in the ruins. They're like nothing we've seen to date.
Fine. Let's move.
Hey, if you say so. You do all the work.
That's unfortunate, but I understand how difficult it must have been in that place.
Again, I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal. May Arkay guide you.
Thank you. You are truly worthy of all the praise being given to you. I salute you. I'll keep the ring as a reminder of... hmmm...
On second thought, you keep it. You were the last to travel with him, and I feel you deserve it as a memento of your achievement.
I won't take no for an answer. I want you to keep it.
I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Cheydinhal. May Arkay guide you.
I thank you for your sympathy. You're truly a noble individual. Were you able to retrieve anything from him before Oblivion took him?
Keep looking boys. Armand Christophe has to be here somewhere.
Hmm. Now that is a bit more specific. Finally, something I can respond to!
Let me think for a moment...
Oh yes! There's one obscure text that references these gems. I believe it's still around here someplace, unless Falcar never returned it.
The name of the book is "Necromancer's Moon." I'm unclear on the origins of the text, but it does involve these gems you're interested in.
I'm afraid you'll have to find it yourself. I'm so out of sorts with all these requests, I've lost track of most everything. It's very distressing.
Help?
No offense, but I don't see how you can do that. Unless you'd like to take some of this work off my shoulders, I'm beyond helping.
But I do appreciate the sentiment. If there's anything specific you need, that may be more reasonable then just asking me about Necromancers.
Oh, of course you were!
No doubt the Council is trying to get you to bother me further. I ran Caranya out of here just a short while ago, and told them to leave me alone!
I keep telling them, I can't produce results if I'm not given any time! I'm not used to working under conditions like this!
Why? Why? Oh, no real reason.
It's just that the entire Council of Mages has been in here at one time or another recently, all wanting information on Necromancers.
Necromancy, of all things!
All I heard was that it was important to Dagail, and it was missing. Kalthar didn't tell me anything more than that.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about it. I heard it was missing, though.
Kalthar was talking about it recently. He seemed very agitated about it. Almost... happy. Strange, isn't that?
You've found it! Oh, how wonderful! Finally, things can return to normal. By all means, see that it gets to her immediately.
There may be a connection to Dagail's father. Have you spoken to her about it?
So Kalthar overheard us, did he? That explains why he's been so cranky lately.
But we never said anything about Dagail's father. How would he know anything about that?
If there's some sort of connection between the seer's stone and Dagail's father, I don't know about it. Maybe if you ask her, it will jog her memory.
In the meantime, I'll keep an eye on Kalthar.
I'm surprised she discussed it with you. She wanted to keep it from the others... I should speak to her about that.
Yes, her seer's stone is missing. It's the one thing that has kept her visions at bay, and without it, they're nearly crippling. She can't function.
We haven't yet spoken to the others, for fear they would be less than accepting of her situation. Perhaps it is time, though.
I will continue to tend to Dagail. Can you speak with the other mages, and find out if any of them have seen the stone?
What? Haven't I said enough already? Just let it go. Once someone finally realizes what's going on here, maybe things will change.
Well, well. Word is finally spreading, is it? They won't be able to keep up this facade much longer!
Yeah, I know all about it. I overheard Agata and Dagail talking. And you know what? I'm glad it's gone!
Why should we be forced to work under someone who's only kept sane by a magical trinket? Haven't we sacrificed enough already?
She shouldn't even be here anymore. Hell, the only reason her father ever fit in anywhere is because he kept a low profile. And look what it got him!
Years of service to the Empire, and not even a tombstone over his head! Hrmph. At least he was able to maintain the illusion of sanity.
I know, I get way too fired up over this. It just annoys me that she's in charge of the guild, when she's clearly not fit. That's all.
Found it, have you? Silenced the hands that betrayed, and took what was mine? Then let me have the stone, so that the voices can be shut out.
A most fascinating contraption. Bothiel is one of the few who understands how it worked, and kept it running.
Our Order works to spread the teachings and worship of the divine Talos.
Surely you have heard of us? If not, I invite you to spend some time in our fine library. All are welcome here.
It isn't widely known, but many brothers of the Order of Talos are also members of the Blades.
Chapterhouses of the Order, like Weynon Priory, provide safehouses for travelling Blades as well as our more public religious functions.
Blades who are too old for active service often join the Order as lay brothers.
We are honored to have Grandmaster Jauffre, or Brother Jauffre as he prefers, as a resident here.
We are a monastic order devoted to divine Talos, who was the mortal Tiber Septim, the founder of the empire.
Your timing is excellent! I'll take the one on the right!
Hail, Dragon Born! Hail, Martin Septim! Hail!
Barthel Gernand is my father. I'm worried about him. I think it will break his heart if we can't build Cropsford.
Barthel Gernand. He talked us into selling our comfortable house in High Rock to start a new settlement here in Cyrodiil.
He read something about cheap land being offered by the government. Of course nobody said anything about the swarming goblins.
I don't know much about that ghost, but some say he died in a horrible shipwreck. I would stay away from him if I were you... bad omen.
Each night, he wanders the shore of Niben Bay. Then he stops and looks mournfully out to sea.
If you're interested, you may want to see Gilgondorin at Silverhome-on-the-Water. When it comes to local legends, he's the best source in town.
Never heard the name Grantham Blakeley before. Means nothing to me, sorry.
The Watchman looks like he may have been a sailor. No one knows where he came from, or why he looks so sad.
I don't like talking about the dead like they're some kind of tourist attraction, but that spirit has been making his ghostly journey for years now.
We've learned to just accept that he's there. Every night, sure as clockwork, he appears at Bawnwatch Camp at 8 on the shore of Niben Bay.
He's never harmed anyone, but most people give him a wide berth. You seem curious enough, so I'll be glad to pinpoint where he appears on your map.
The shores near Bravil are no longer haunted. Seems the ghost hasn't been sighted there any longer.
Kill them, run them out of town - do what you will. I simply want them gone.
Of course, should you be caught murdering them in the streets, the guards will respond accordingly.
I cannot arouse further suspicion by offering leniency to you, should you find yourself on the wrong side of the law.
This I cannot say. I have refrained from expressing too much interest, lest their attention be turned towards the castle.
The citizens will likely know more. I imagine many have noticed their presence here.
There are at least three of them. I know only one by name: a wood elf called Eridor. He's rather good, from what I understand.
I could handle them myself. But it would be... unwise to display my prowess in public. That is the folly of the young and proud.
Of course, should you be caught murdering them in the streets, the guards will respond accordingly. I can't be connected with this, remember?
I assure you, I am not responsible for them. I would never be so careless. Where there are mindless animals, predators are never far behind.
This is not the first time such a thing has happened, however.
On some level, they're aware of my presence. Whether they covet all that I have, or simply wish to see it destroyed, I do not know.
They have given in to their instincts, and are little more than animals. They need to be exterminated, one way or another.
The cavern is a short distance east of the castle. Far enough from town that few residents have reason to pass by it, thankfully.
It is a minor situation, to be sure, but neither I nor my guards can become directly involved.
A nest of vampires has sprung up in Bloodcrust Cavern, southeast of the town. They are a threat to the town, and must be eliminated.
Their presence has drawn a group of vampire hunters to town, following rumors of "vampires in Skingrad."
While I do not believe my identity has been compromised, I do not wish to take any chances, and so cannot act on either matter.
You, however, can act with impunity, and so will take care of this for me. Then I will tell you what I know.
And miss the opportunity to take advantage of your help? I think not. I assure you, the information I have will be worth your time.
Once Martin uses the Amulet of Kings to light the Dragonfires, the barriers between Oblivion and Tamriel will be restored.
The Oblivion Gates will close, and Mehrunes Dagon's invasion will have failed.
The coronation of each new Emperor is sealed when he uses the Amulet of Kings to light the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One.
The Dragonfires of Akatosh remain lit until the death of the Emperor. His successor then lights them anew upon ascending to the throne.
With Emperor Uriel dead and no successor crowned, the Temple of the One will be dark for the first time in centuries.
I believe that Martin's sacrifice sealed the gates of Oblivion forever. Tamriel no longer needs the protection of the Dragonfires.
Well, I should return to my duties. Till next time, then.
Ah, well, I'd love to continue chatting, but I have to prepare for my next contract. You know... that Mages Guild matter. You understand.
Right. Well, my contracts await. Maybe we can talk some more later.
Right, then. We should probably get back to our duties, eh?
[Sigh.] Well, I suppose I should get going. So many contracts, so little time.
Ah, all right then. I guess I should get back to my duties. I should be around later. We'll talk.
You are truly an asset to this Sanctuary. Here's hoping all of our contracts work out that well!
Sister, you are truly an asset to this Sanctuary. Here's hoping all of our contracts work out that well!
I'm just glad to know you came out of it all unscathed. Not that I doubted your abilities, but you know me. I worry.
Yes, well, if there's one thing you know how to do, it's get yourself out of an unwinnable situation! He he he he.
He he. Remember, Dear Brother, I can't always be there to get you out of trouble!
He he. Remember, Dear Sister, I can't always be there to get you out of trouble!
Sometimes I wonder how you survive at all without me being there to watch your back! He he he.
Oh! You must mean the orphanage contract! Well, it's true. The children actually tried to defend themselves. Poor dears. He he he he he.
So you heard? Yes, yes, it was quite the debacle. The head just wouldn't sever! Cut, saw, hack... By Sithis, I swear her tendons were made of steel!
Ah, yes, that was quite a situation I got myself into. But I have to admit, I had quite a bit of fun cleaning up my own mess! He he he he.
Heard about that, did you? Ha ha ha! All right, so things got a bit out of control. Nothing I couldn't handle though, as you can plainly see.
By Sithis, what a night that was! Reminded me of the time you and I raided that traveling carnival! Ah, now that takes me back...
Word certainly gets around fast, doesn't it? Don't tell me -- Antoinetta has been running her mouth off again. Anyway, nothing I couldn't handle.
All right, so I may have gotten a bit careless. But the contract was fulfilled, wasn't it? In the end, that's all that matters.
I've been meaning to ask you about your last contract. I heard there were some... complications.
I heard about your most recent contract. I just wanted to congratulate you on a job well done. You had quite the time of it, or so I hear!
Is it true what I've heard about your most recent contract? You were forced to eliminate everyone? Even the... non-essentials?
Everyone's talking about your latest exploits. Not only did you eliminate the target, but his six Imperial Legion escorts as well! Most impressive.
So is it true about your latest contract? The girl's nanny was actually a Fighters Guild bodyguard?
But of course. What troubles you?
Of course. What is it?
Have faith, Aloys. I'm sure my father will think of something.
I'm sure you're right. You saved our lives back there. I'm just not ready to give up on our dream...
Your father was the one that got us into this mess! I'm tired of you always defending him.
You know what I think. We should go home before the goblins find us and kill us all.
I wouldn't recommend it, sir. You don't want to put yourselves in the middle of a goblin war.
What is it you want to know?
I've got my men scattered all over town.
Shamar's up by the statue, Vontus is out in the High Pasture, and Carsten has the town exit near the Castle covered.
Then what do you want with me? I'm a busy man. I don't have time to stand around and chat.
You have my assurance that my men and I will do everything in our power to keep the people of... Skingrad safe. We're here to help.
If you have seen anything unusual, particularly anything implying the presence of the undead here in town, please report it at once.
All I care about is where the vampires are hiding. I know they're here somewhere... You know where they're holed up?
So word hasn't gotten around to all the townspeople. Interesting. They must be very good at keeping a low profile.
We heard tell that vampires have infiltrated the town. Came here to root them out.
Well, that's not really any of your concern, now is it?
You mind your business, and we'll mind ours.
I'm a vampire hunter. I came here with a few others to get rid of the vampires in Skingrad.
Oh, that's right. We've heard all about it.
Now, we just need to find them...
You'll have to forgive me if I don't answer. I don't trust you, frankly.
If you say so.
Here's some money.
The investigator the Countess hired failed to find the thief. I almost feel bad for her.
Things seem back to normal now. Glad the painting was recovered.
Countess Valga is up in arms about the painting being stolen. We're supposed to keep an eye on things until it's found.
I hate when the Countess gets angry. No liquor rations for us.
I suppose it can wait for a while. Let me know if you change your mind.
Good. Find out where he's keeping the taxes and bring them to me. I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it.
Sadly, you must demonstrate more skill before I can allow a commission job.
Sell more stolen treasures to the fences. They will let me know when you have proven skillful enough.
I have a special request from the widow of a former fence in Leyawiin. As your new Doyen, I am asking you to help her.
A street scavenger made off with a ring that the widow Ahdarji values highly. She is offering a reward.
The guild frowns on freelance thieves. Are you willing to go to Leyawiin, find the ring, and get it back to Ahdarji?
I don't want that ring! It's too hot to sell. You are supposed to take it to Ahdarji. I swear, the new recruits are getting worse.
You must do more to fill the guild's treasury before I can assign you commission jobs.
Seek more loot. Keep the fences busy with your profits. Then we can talk.
I have need of a very special book, the Lost Histories of Tamriel. The cat burglar Theranis was sent hunting in Skingrad for this book.
However, Theranis has not been seen since. The Gray Fox himself hunts for this book. I need you to find Theranis.
Help Theranis bring back this book. If Theranis is unwilling or unable, bring back the book yourself. Are you agreeable?
Doesn't the hunter have prey to follow?
You are unproven, or at least insufficiently proven for the tasks this one has available.
Gold is the blood of the Thieves Guild. Keep the fences busy and rich. Then come to see me.
I have a small problem that you may be able to help with. The guild will even pay a reward.
That buffoon, Hieronymus Lex, has invaded the Imperial City Waterfront. Imperial Watch guards from all over the city prowl the streets.
You are skillful, but not skillful enough. Prove your worth to me. Provide the guild fences with the bounty of your work, then return.
Hieronymus Lex must be eliminated once and for all. The Gray Fox has asked that you do this personally. It is a most delicate matter.
I have no more jobs for a thief of your skill. You have no need of the Doyen to provide you work.
However, there are rumors that the Gray Fox himself may call on you soon. Wait for contact from him. Keep the guild fences busy.
I only provide work for less skillful thieves. If you take their jobs, what will they do for a living?
The Gray Fox himself may call on you soon, though. Wait for contact from him. Keep the guild fences busy. You can find your own work.
You have to find your own jobs now. Just keep selling stuff to the fences.
The Gray Fox is watching your career carefully. He may contact you soon with a special job.
You need more experience before I can use you on a commission job. Ongar tells me that you haven't turned in much loot yet.
When you've contributed enough to the guild coffers by selling stolen items to Ongar, I might have something for you. Come back then.
The Gray Fox has asked me to take care of a problem, and I'm putting you on it.
Hieronymus Lex actually collected taxes from everyone living here on the Waterfront! Your job is to recover those taxes. Are you up for it?
Maybe I wasn't clear before. You only talk business with me in the Garden of Dareloth around midnight.
I do have need of a skilled operative. Perhaps if you were to get more experience I could use you.
The fences report to me how much loot you have turned over to them. When you've added more to the guild coffers, come back and see me.
The guild has received a 'request' to obtain a unique statuette. It is a bust of Llathasa Indarys, the recently slain Countess of Cheydinhal.
You will be paid a modest sum. Do you want this job?
You know better than to contact me here. Meet me at the usual place. Dareloth's Garden, at midnight.
Sadly, I don't have anything for you. I only work with the less experienced guild members. You should go see S'krivva in Bravil from now on.
You can find her at the Lonely Suitor lodge. I wouldn't recommend bothering her at home, unless the door is unlocked.
Do you realize what you're saying? Do you fully understand the honor you are rejecting? For your own sake, return to me when you're ready.
Adamus Phillida has spent his entire career investigating the Dark Brotherhood, interrupting our contracts, killing our family members!
We tried to eliminate Phillida, of course, but failed on three separate occassions. He's a powerful man, and was surrounded by powerful associates.
Now the Legion pig's years of service have come to an end. He has retired. Phillida must not be allowed such a victory! His destiny is... darker.
Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.
Let me know when you have the money and the tax records
It seems you got carried away and killed someone. We do not condone murder in the Thieves Guild.
You are no longer a Thieves Guild member until you pay the blood price. Guild tradition holds that you must pay it for each person slain.
Ah! The Gray Fox will be very pleased. We will make sure this gets back to the people.
Can you believe that fool even bothered to collect this paltry sum? You can keep it. I merely wanted the Watch to know they went too far.
I think its time to promote you to Footpad. Congratulations on your new guild rank.
I don't believe you, but I'll have to check it out anyway. If you are right, there will be hell to pay. You will have to come along.
Then you are wasting my time.
Your credibility is suspect. You'll have to do better than that to persuade me.
Are you sure? That can't be right. She's my... I mean she doesn't seem to be the type.
He's in hiding. I hear Methredhel is looking for you, though.
He is in hiding. Armand is accused of stealing the bust of Llathasa Indarys from Cheyhindal. They say Count Indarys himself filed the charges.
That's unfortunate. Let me know if you change your mind.
Excellent. Bring it back to me once you have it.
Please pay a visit to Count Hassildor in Skingrad. If his information is as vital as he claims, we need it as soon as possible.
Are you prepared to begin?
Nenyond Twyll awaits you. Return with Mucianus as quickly as possible, so I may settle the Council's fears.
There is only one task with which you should be concerned. Intercept that soul gem before it reaches Mannimarco's hands.
Word has been sent that the Necromancers have been quite busy, creating black soul gems for their master.
In particular, a unique Black Soul Gem has been crafted in the south of Cyrodiil, in the ruins of Silorn.
This gem needs to be confiscated and brought here, before it can be delivered to the King of Worms and used against us.
Are you truly prepared for this task? I cannot be certain what awaits you, but I am sure we will not speak again after you begin.
Before you begin, we must first discuss your advancement within the guild.
Your tasks now come directly from Arch-Mage Traven. Please speak with him if you're unsure what you should be doing.
You have your task. Acquire wood for a staff from the grove outside Wellspring Cave.
Before you can begin work for the guild, you'll need to do something for yourself.
Every mage carries a staff. It is crafted and enchanted by the guild, and is a symbol of status. You need such a staff.
The Council is investigating what happened at Wellspring Cave. Many of our resources are devoted to the task, leaving our ranks spread thin.
There is a related book that needs to be recovered. It was recently loaned to Janus Hassildor, the Count of Skingrad. I'd like you to retrieve it.
I understand this may not seem the most important of tasks, but still... it needs doing, and you are one of the few available to do it.
A note of caution: Skingrad is an... unusual place. Be prepared for the unexpected.
Speak with Irlav Jarol. He can give you the details you need.
Are you ready for it? If not, I understand. You've been through quite a bit lately.
Are you prepared to begin your next task for the guild?
Seek out Arch-Mage Traven. He has personally requested that you see him for your next assignment.
I can truly consider you an equal, and so grant you the rank of Master-Wizard. There is no higher rank which I can bestow upon you.
You have my congratulations, and my thanks.
Truly, you are an asset to the guild. I reward you with the rank of Wizard, and teach you a most powerful spell.
Your role within the guild becomes ever more essential. You have now attained the rank of Warlock, and are freely able to access the Council Chamber.
You are Conjurer no more. Guild members shall now address you as Magician. Congratulations.
You become more valuable to the guild with each passing day. The guild wishes to reward that, and so you are raised to the rank of Conjurer.
Accept these robes, and wear them with pride.
Your services to the guild have not gone unnoticed. As of this moment, you have gained the rank of Evoker.
Along with your new rank, please take this amulet. May it help keep you safe in times of danger.
In accordance with guild rules, you now qualify for the rank of Journeyman. May you wear your rank well.
You do not yet qualify for further advancement in the guild.
Courage, soldier. We have an Emperor again.
No. If we let ourselves get besieged in the Palace we're doomed. We must get to the Temple of the One immediately.
Fool! You've just exposed me to the Thieves Guild. That "citizen" is actually the guild member that was hired to do the theft!
But I've been loyal to you! I've reported everything that Armand has done. You can't just toss me aside like a soiled cloth!
Regrettably I've no further use for you. If what I heard is true, you're the thief. If what you say is true, the Gray Fox knows you are my informant.
Either way, it's over. You didn't really think I'd trust the likes of you for very long?
Ha! I expected as much from a Dark Brotherhood lapdog! I may not survive this fight, but I'll not make it easy for you!
You show unexpected mercy. For that I am thankful. My treasure is hidden in a hollowed-out rock near my campfire. It's yours.
Oh yes, I suppose Teinaava wants proof that I'm dead, eh? Let me guess -- my heart? I suggest you take the heart of the dead Argonian Agent.
His body is around here somewhere. Present the Agent's heart to Teinaava as proof, and he'll be none the wiser.
When Ocheeva and I trained with the Dark Brotherhood as children, we befriended another initiate, a Shadowscale by the name of Scar-Tail.
The three of us were inseperable. When our training was completed, we reluctantly parted ways. But now... Now, the unthinkable has happened!
Scar-Tail has fled Black Marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin! This is an act of treason! This treachery must be punished!
Just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member, a Shadowscale is forbidden from slaying another Shadowscale.
That is why you must go to Bogwater and eliminate that treacherous snake! Please kill Scar-Tail, so Ocheeva and I can put this matter behind us.
Scar-Tail is a traitor to Argonia, and a blight upon Tamriel! Kill him, as my brother requests, and we will be forever in your debt.
Scar-Tail now lies with the worms of Bogwater, thanks to you. I am forever indebted to you, Brother.
Scar-Tail now lies with the worms of Bogwater, thanks to you. I am forever indebted to you, Sister.
Scar-Tail was once as a brother to me and Ocheeva. But his act of treason destroyed any vestige of that relationship. His death was well-deserved!
Very well. Speak to me later if you change your mind. I fear the issue will remain unresolved unless you can help.
I find your decision most agreeable! Now, the details. Far south of here, on the southern end of Cyrodiil, lies a swamp called Bogwater.
Hiding in that swamp you will find an Argonian Shadowscale named Scar-Tail. Kill this renegade, and bring me his heart as proof of the deed.
Hrmph. Why all the fuss now?
I thought it would've died down by now, what with the ban on the practice of Necromancy in the guild being in place for as long as it has.
And yet suddenly everyone shows up on my doorstep, needing information immediately. Nevermind that I might have things of my own to work on.
Eletta and Zahrasha dead? I can't believe it!
They've never been so bold before now. Always hiding in the shadows, staying away from the guild. What could have prompted this?
I'll need to speak to the council about this. Thank you for relaying the information. Now, tend to your staff, and your wounds, if necessary.
Delmar at the Chironasium can help you with the staff. You still need wood from the grove before he can create your staff. Get it immediately.
Delmar at the Chironasium can help you with the staff. See him right away.
So, you saw them? The altars must be infused with some kind of power to change over the soul gems.
I shall pass the news on to the Council. Most troubling, indeed, to know that these are not merely myths.
I also fear their numbers may be greater than we believed.
You have again performed admirably. You have my thanks, and that of the Council as well.
I've heard things, to be sure, but I don't really know anything about them.
Is it true that some of our guildmates were killed? Oh, how horrible!
Stop following me! I'll beat both of you... if I can just figure out where Amantius Allectus lives.
You don't have the diary. Stop wasting my time!
Methredhel has delivered the diary to me. She has earned her place in the guild. You did not do so well.
Since we rarely get three potential recuits at the same time, I'll give you one more shot. Amusei is a bungler and won't get this offer.
The first one to bring back Rohssan's sword will become a member. But, this is the last chance. The loser gets nothing. Do you accept?
Congratulations! You have returned with the diary. You have earned the right to join the Thieves Guild.
You now owe your loyalty to our guildmaster, the Gray Fox. He has three rules you must follow.
Congratulations! You have returned with the diary.
Unfortunately, you were stupid enough to kill Amantius Allectus in the process!
Now you must pay his blood price to enter the guild. However, because you are not yet a member, it is only half of what it would normally be.
It took two tries, but you finally made it. You have earned the right to join the Thieves Guild.
Well, you finally returned with Rohssan's sword.
Unfortunately, you were stupid enough to kill Rohssan in the process!
Now you must pay her blood price to enter the guild. However, because you are not yet a member, it is only half of what it would normally be.
You should drop out now. You know I'm going to win.
You walk a dangerous path. Keep the secret of the guild... or else. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Good. Remember, you may not kill anyone while doing this. If you need any lock picks, I can sell you some.
I am in the Thieves Guild.
This staff will allow you to nullify magic protecting your enemies. If you'd prefer another enchantment, we can start over.
The staff will allow you to manipulate objects normally out of your reach. A handy, and often amusing, spell. Is this what you'd like?
This staff will allow you to trap the souls of enemies you defeat, if you can do so before the effect wears off. Is this acceptable?
With this staff, you'll render others incapable of using magic against you. If you'd prefer something else, we can start over.
You'll be able to freeze opponents in their tracks for a short time with this staff. I can begin work now, or we can start over.
With this, you can manipulate people's opinions of you. Is this what you want? If not, we can start over.
Right. I'll get to work. You come see me tomorrow, and I'll have your staff ready.
Your staff will let you wield the power of lightning. If you want something else instead, we can start over.
Your staff will give you power over ice. Is that what you want? If not, we can start over.
You'll have a staff capable of creating fireballs. If that's what you want, I'll get started right away. Otherwise, we can start over.
Oh, all right then.
Your choices are Destruction, Illusion, or Mysticism. Which will it be?
There are three things I can enchant the staff with: Soul Trap, Telekinesis, and Dispel.
There are three options for Illusion magic. They are Charm, Paralyze, and Silence. Which would you like?
Very well. You have three choices for what type of damage you'd like it to do: Fire, Frost, or Shock.
Very well. I'll be here when you're ready.
Enchanting staves can be a tricky business. Only certain spells will be truly useful to you, so I'll narrow it down some.
Let's start with the school. Which appeals most to you - Destruction, Illusion, or Mysticism?
Bust? What bust? I didn't overhear any conversation about a bust.
You know where the bust is hidden?
Sure. I've heard about it. What's it worth to ya?
It's not safe for me to handle the bust. I shouldn't even be talking to you. Go find Methredel. She has your instructions.
Hey, I don't read them. I just deliver them.
Not here. Not now. Garden of Dareloth. Waterfront District. Midnight.
Ah, yes. Another scoundrel who served time in an imperial jail. The Gray Fox is offering you a chance to join the Thieves Guild.
Very well. I confess to the crime. But please understand I only did it out of the great love I had in my heart for Count Valga.
It was I that painted that portrait. When the Count was lost, the Countess spent so much time with it that I became jealous.
I had to have the painting back, so I decided to steal it then hide it behind the painting in my quarters.
I am ashamed of my crime, but ready to face what fate has in store for me.
You have strong evidence, but I do not trust you enough to speak true my motivations.
How dare you accuse me without enough evidence to back up your story!
Then get away from me and get back to your duties, so I can do mine.
I don't care what you have found. I am telling you, I am not the one you are looking for! And I will speak to the Countess of your accusations!
Now off with you!
You ever hear the expression, 'fools rush in where Daedra fear to tread'? Well, accusing anyone without evidence is mighty foolish.
Hah! You are too late. I have the diary!
He's the person to talk to about an audience with the Count.
He's not available right now. You can either wait here for him, or come back later.
He's the person to talk to about an audience with the Count. You'll find him in the County Hall.
I'm afraid that's not my arena. You'll have to speak to Mercator about seeing the Count.
I am unsure as to why he has requested that you, of all people, should be the one to visit him. I have no wish to put you in harm's way.
Saved you, did he? Well, that's a good sign.
I must apologize. It was never the Council's intention to put you in harm's way.
All appointments to see the Count must go through Mercator Hosidus.
The Count is a reclusive man, and sometimes difficult to see. Hopefully, your status as a representative of the Guild will aid you.
Speak with the castle steward when you arrive.
I understand he specifically asked that you be the one to see him. Rather unlike him...
All appointments to see the Count must be made through Hal-Luirz
I can't thank you enough for returning it, friend.
Ah, you've got it! Thank the gods! Finally, my mead will stay cold and won't taste like goblin piss. Take these, and my thanks.
Took my flagon, they did! Passed down to me from my father Rulf, and from his father Torbalt. It's a wondrous cup. Keeps ale cold and sweet.
Been drinking from a lousy wooden tankard since. It's just not the same. If you can find it, you'd have the gratitude of Newheim the Portly!
Can't say I know anything myself, but I heard that Newheim the Portly had some things stolen, and he's been asking around about it. Ask him.
Hmmm. I don't think I know you well enough to tell you that.
Aye. I know about those scum. Rotten bastards robbed me blind, they did. Stole a family heirloom. Bunch of Bosmer, if you can believe that!
No offense to you or your friend, of course. Last I heard, they were holed up in Hrota Cave, not too far from here.
Aye. I know about those scum. Rotten bastards robbed me blind, they did. Stole a family heirloom. Bunch of Bosmer, if you can believe it!
No offense to your friend, of course. Last I heard, they were holed up in Hrota Cave, not too far from here.
Cleared them out, did you? Good work, you two. I see big things for you with the Guild. Here's your payment.
There have been a number of thefts in the area, and witnesses believe the thieves are holed up nearby. Check around, and see what you can learn.
I'm not sure the numbers you'll be dealing with, so I'm sending you with another new recruit. Maglir. I believe you two have already met.
Let's get rid of these guys, so we can get paid.
Sounds like we'll find the bandits in Hrota Cave.
Let's find this Fat Newheim guy. Whatever his name is. He apparently knows where these bandits are.
Sounds like we need to ask around Anvil for any clues. Figures we'd get a mission without any real direction. I'll follow you.
Hrota Cave? I believe it's a bit north of here. Shouldn't be too hard to find.
You'll find it north of Anvil. Good luck, and give it to those bastards good.
I am Newheim the Portly. What can I do for you?
You've gotten them? Wonderful! But... their names are familiar to me. All of those men have worked for me! Amazing.
I even trusted them to open up the shop in the mornings. I can't imagine what turned them to a life of crime. Sad. Well, here's your payment.
As I said, I'll need you to stop these thieves from breaking into my store. It only seems to happen at night.
I've lost a great deal of merchandise over the last few months. I keep replacing it, but they keep stealing it, new locks on the doors be damned!
They always come at night, after I've gone to bed. Maybe a mage transports them inside! You can just stay in the shop overnight. Good luck!
I'm going to wait at the Flowing Bowl until this mess is settled. I know I can trust you to keep the place safe.
He runs Lelles' Quality "Mercandise." Ha! Not a bad sort. You can usually find him in his store.
I am Norbert Lelles. How may I help you?
Sounds like everything is taken care of there. Good work.
So... you took care of the thieves. Excellent. You'll want to talk to Lelles to close out the contract. And get paid, of course.
Sounds like he wants your help stopping the theft at his store. What are you doing here talking to me?
He runs Lelles' Quality Merchandise here in Anvil. He's been having problems with break-ins, though, and he's hired us to put a stop to it.
That's right. Rats. In my basement. And something has been killing them! It's horrible. My poor babies! You must do something!
I don't know what I'd do without them. Their little pink noses, their scaly little tails. Please, get to the basement and find out what's happening.
Yes, rats. I'm sure she can explain it to you better than I. She lives here in Anvil. Go and talk to her. Good luck!
Me? Pah! I was just getting used to being retired. You can see how good my painting is getting. I'm an old man. I've done my time.
Then again... someone has to keep you in line. Make sure you don't bring the Guild down around our ears.
I'll do it... Guildmaster. Just come to me when you want to assign duties to the Guild. I'll make sure they get done.
You would violate a direct order? I should expel you now! But... this does not all fall on your shoulders. Much of the fault is mine.
I love this Guild, and all its members, perhaps to a fault. My concern for them has made me blind to what's been happening around me.
Now, we must speak about what you've done, and how it will affect any further advancement in the Guild.
With Oreyn? He was dismissed! I should expel you now! But... no. It isn't Oreyn who is to blame. I fear it is I.
I love the Fighters Guild, and all its members, perhaps to a fault. I fear my concern for them has made me blind to what's been happening around me.
If it were not for you, and Oreyn... I dare not think it. Now, we must speak about what you've done, and how it will affect any further advancement.
Your accomplishments are impressive. Because of this, I bestow upon you the rank of Warder of the Fighters Guild.
Your service to the guild has not gone unnoticed. Henceforth, you will carry the rank of Defender. Bear the title proudly.
You're due for advancement. I hereby name you Protector of the Fighters Guild.
You've done well. Because of your efforts, you have achieved the rank of Swordsman of the Fighters Guild.
Looks like it is time for a promotion. Due to your performance, I name you Journeyman of the Fighters Guild.
You have done well so far. I hereby promote you to Apprentice. Good luck.
You will advance through the ranks of the Fighters Guild when you have proven your merit.
As you complete contracts and fulfill your duties, you'll be promoted to the next station, accepting the associated duties and responsibilities.
Be aware, though, that your rank can be stripped for failure to uphold the tenets of the guild, or at the sole discretion of the guildmaster.
I'm sorry. You're not yet ready for a promotion. Keep completing contracts, and take care of any assigned duties.
Ha! Made you Guildmaster? Amazing. You earned it, though you'll likely muck it all up. So, what are you going to do with your newfound rank?
Be aware, though, that your rank can be stripped for failure to uphold the tenets of the guild, or at my discretion.
Because of your actions, I am hereby stripping you of your rank of Champion. You were reckless, foolhardy, and dangerous to yourself and the Guild.
They were also brave, and necessary. Because of this, I am hereby naming you Master of the Fighters Guild, effective immediately.
The Guild has passed me by. You are its future. Take your responsibilty seriously. I wish you luck. You still have many duties to perform.
You've cleared every contract we've got on the books. That's some good work. You're now promoted to Champion of the Fighters Guild.
You outrank me, now, so there's certainly no more I can do for you. You might check with an old friend of yours, though.
Rumor has it that Oreyn's looking for you. You didn't hear it from me, though. Good work, and good luck.
You've done good work, and you deserve better than your current rank. I'm restoring your previous rank of Guardian. Congratulations.
Look, I can't promote you. Not now. You'll need to get some contracts completed, and then I can do it.
You've been doing a good job, and under a lot of scrutiny. I've been authorized to promote you to the rank of Guardian. Good work.
There's really no more I can promote you. After all, you do outrank me.
It belonged to an ancestor, Oreyn Bearclaw, but was lost for centuries. It was found only when Malacath wrongly believed my family line ended.
It was returned to me by a stranger from my homeland, Morrowind. Wear it proudly. Perhaps you can help restore the glory of my family's name.
No. The entire town... I realize you must be disgusted with yourself. I'm sorry for that. It was the Hist Sap, though, not you.
We now know the threat this group poses. Perhaps better than they themselves know it. We must take decisive action now.
I'm worried about those people. The Blackwood Company can't be trusted with their lives and homes. Get there and look into it.
Don't be stupid. We have returned with the Hist itself. One beautiful Hist, who gives her gifts to all the Company.
The clever mages made it possible. Magic and iron. But this is not the time to talk. You drink your gift and go with your new brothers.
This? Why, it is a gift from the swamps of Argonia. Sap of the Hist. A present from my homeland. The Hist are generous to us. So generous.
No jobs? Ha! There is much work to be done here in Cyrodiil! The Blackwood Company is more than willing to do it.
You don't look strong enough to me, though. A bit inexperienced, perhaps. Still, maybe we will find work for you. You may join. For now.
Since you seem eager to get started, follow me to the training area. We've got a mission you might want a piece of.
You wish to join the Blackwood Company, do you? Hmm...I think I've heard of you, though.
Fighters Guild, aren't you? Done many jobs for them recently. Yes. What makes you want to join us?
You want to join us? Hmm... another guild rat leaving the ship. Very well. Speak with Jeetum-Ze. He handles recruitment here.
We are over one hundred strong now. We grow by the day!
Fine, fine. I'll come with you. My guards are dead. You win, for now.
Come with you? Not likely. I know some of my men are still alive. Guards! Attack!
He's a warrior, a battle-hardened mercenary who's spent time all over Tamriel. He'll keep his prize tree locked away. You'll need to find his key.
Well done! With that tree gone, the Blackwood Company is just another band of mercenaries. Cyrodiil is a safer place for what you've done.
I want you to take this. May it serve you well. Now, you should tell Vilena Donton what has happened.
Perhaps she will understand what it is we have done. I believe our work is now finished. You are a fine soldier, my friend. You've made me proud.
This tree is the source of our problems. It is an abomination of nature, and it must be destroyed.
As long as the Blackwood Company has access to the sap, we are all in danger. I fear they no longer know what they do.
You must find a way to destroy the Hist, though I can imagine Ri'Zakar will have it well guarded. Expect an unfriendly welcome at their hall.
Amazing. And insane. I'll look into it further.
They're using Hist Sap? And they claim to have brought a tree into Cyrodiil? Amazing. I can't imagine what the sap might do to non-Argonians.
I'm a bit surprised it affected you the way it did, given your heritage. Perhaps something's tainted it. I'm concerned about Water's Edge.
I want you to go back there. Make sure the Company hasn't ousted the residents. Lay low. I don't want them finding you there.
I'm not surprised you were found the way you were. I imagine those men have built up a tolerance to the stuff.
I'm concerned about Water's Edge. I want you to go back there. Make sure the Company hasn't ousted the residents. Lay low.
We have been contracted by the town of Water's Edge to rid their town of goblins. They've been raiding for days, and appear to be in large numbers.
The four of you here will go. I believe it should suffice, given our record of success. Take this. It will help you in battle.
A simple mission, nothing more. You should be fine. Please, head downstairs, and I'll brief you further.
I want you to get to Leyawiin and join the Blackwood Company. Find the secret of their success.
You'll be on your own. Steer clear of me and all of your Fighters Guild brothers. It'll be rough going, but you can do it.
You got some information out of him, which is good. We can use it. Here, take this. It might help you some time.
You've brought him back. Good. I want to know the size of their forces, and who is leading them. I also want to know the source of their strength.
Do what you must to make him talk. If you can smooth talk him, fine. If you need to rough him up, so be it. But don't kill him. We need him to talk.
Now, go tell him to sit down. If he tries to get up, I'll kill him myself.
He's the one in charge of this expansion. I know he's a high-ranking member of the group. An Argonian mage, from what I hear.
Very well. I can see you're familiar with Mankar Camoran's "Commentaries."
I know that daedric cults are not quite the thing socially, but that's just foolish prejudice and superstition.
For the adventurous, open-minded thinker, daedric worship holds many rewards.
What makes you think that I know how to get it? And why would I tell you even if I did know?
Outrageous! And you have the nerve to brag about it to my face? I have half a mind to call the guards and have you arrested!
What? Phintias sold you my copy? This is outrageous! I must speak to Phintias at once. That book is mine!
You want me to publically accuse Audens Avidius of corruption? I'd sooner swim naked in a pool filled with slaughterfish and mudcrabs!
Testify against a Watch Captain and accuse him of corruption? I don't think I'm willing to risk doing that.
This may be the stupidest thing I've ever done, but I'll testify against Audens Avidius. I suppose someone has to stand up to him.
I'll find Itius Hayn first thing in the morning.
You want me to testify against Audens Avidius? You're crazy. Exactly how do you intend to persuade me to do that?
You've convinced me. If I don't stand up to him, who will? I just hope I'm not committing suicide.
I do it first thing in the morning.
I don't know what you're talking about. Get out of my shop.
Ruslan and Luronk. Those idiots don't know when to stay quiet. Look, I'm not telling you anything, stranger. I don't trust you.
He's shaken down most of the shopkeepers in the Market District. They're all too afraid of him to do anything. Jensine wouldn't even talk about it.
Someone ought to do something about him.
I don't have time for this now. The Gray Fox is on the loose. Take this problem to Itius Hayn. He's also a Captain of the Imperial Watch.
I've only recently been promoted. I'm not going to cause trouble by filing charges against one of the other Watch Captains.
You could try taking your problem to Itius Hayn. Maybe he'll be willing to risk his career by arresting Audens.
These are very serious charges. If you can get two witnesses to testify against Audens Avidius, I'll arrest him. Otherwise I can't help you.
Why should I trust your word? You'll have to do better than this to persuade me to take action against one of the other Watch Captains.
I have two witnesses willing to testify against Audens Avidius. I'll get a warrant and arrest him.
You must be stupid to accuse me of corruption to my face.
In fact, I'm pretty sure you just attacked me. I think I need to arrest you for assaulting a member of the Imperial Watch.
If you've got a complaint, tell it to the Watch Captain. I've got better things to do than listen to you whine.
Who told you that?
I guess I can trust you. It's that bastard Audens Avidius. He's in here every month taking my wares without paying for them.
What can I do? He's a Captain of the Imperial Watch. Only another Watch Captain can arrest him. Fat chance of that happening.
The bastard took every coin I had with me. I don't know his name, but I know his face.
Ruslan and I were shopping at Jensine's when he accused us of stealing. We turned out our pockets to prove we were innocent, but he didn't care.
We had to pay the "fine" or he was going to march us off to jail.
I don't know his name, but I'd recognize him if I saw him again.
Luronk and I were shopping at Jensine's when he accused us of stealing. Even Jensine said we were innocent, but he didn't care.
We had to pay his "fine" or go to jail.
I don't get paid until tomorrow. I guess I'll just have to wait to eat 'til then.
Blessings of Akatosh upon you!
I'm short on skilled thieves of your rank just now. If you change your mind, come back and see me.
This is good. Go to Leyawiin. Speak with Ahdarji and help her find her ring.
All Thieves Guild members have sworn loyalty to him. If there is such a thing as a guildmaster, he's it.
He's been around forever. It must be 300 years or more since he took charge. I'm not sure he's even human.
He's been around for hundreds of years. I've heard tell that he is immortal. I don't know about that, but he sure ain't normal.
He's kind of like a guildmaster for the Thieves Guild. All I know is that the Doyen and other senior guild members do his bidding like trained dogs.
We don't talk about him in public. The Thieves Guild follows the Gray Fox. However, we make sure that most folks think he is just a myth.
Are you looking for him?
Of course it's all just made up to give them an excuse to keep us down.
Ohh! He's that wanted criminal. Isn't he a master thief? I hear he's dangerous, too. I've heard that the beggars spy for him.
Blasted thief. I hope they string him up when they catch him. He's a slippery one, though. The beggars are his eyes and ears.
Don't pay attention to those rumors. There is no such thing as a Thieves Guild. The Gray Fox is just a thief the Watch hasn't caught yet.
I'm offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of the Gray Fox. Until he is turned over to me, the Waterfront is closed for 'business.'
I don't answer questions about myself. Particularly when they come from a Shadowfoot.
Everyone wants to know about the Gray Fox. Gray Fox this, Gray Fox that. He's just a man, not a Daedric lord.
I've heard it all. They say he's immortal because he's led the Thieves Guild for over 300 years.
No-one has ever seen his face because he always wears that gray cowl.
Oh, and speaking of the Gray Cowl, did you know he stole it from Nocturnal herself?
You'd think he was Saint Nerevar the way they talk about him.
The Gray Fox and I are closer than brothers. We share a desire to remain unknown.
He's a most mysterious fellow. In many ways I admire him. Most of the time I just feel sorry for him.
He's just a thief. He's supposed to be the head of the Thieves Guild. What a joke! Can you imagine a bunch of thieves trying to form a guild?
The nobility hate him, but the peasants and the beggars love him, especially in the Waterfront.
He's that thief that the Imperial Watch are always going on about. He likes to steal from rich folk.
Nobody really knows who he is. He's always hiding under that weird cowl. Kinda spooky if you ask me.
He is the greatest of all thieves. I have heard it said that he stole his gray cowl from Nocturnal herself.
He's just a name on a wanted poster. I don't trust you enough to say more than that.
Quiet, you fool. The Garden of Dareloth, on the Waterfront. Midnight. Be there.
You say a beggar told you seek me out? Good enough for me then. The beggars are the eyes and ears of the Gray Fox.
He is the King of Thieves in Cyrodiil. You could think of him as our guildmaster, although he would deny that title.
This is neither the time nor the place.
I didn't think much about him when I first joined the Thieves Guild. Lately I've been hearing odd things though.
That Gray Cowl he wears was stolen from Nocturnal herself. Can you imagine having the nerve to steal from a Daedric Lord?
Yes, well... I'm a very busy man. Enjoying my retirement, don't you know. So why don't you just... go away.
Oh, Sithis needs my soul does he? Well, you can tell your Dread Father that he can kiss my wrinkled arse! Defend yourself, Dark Brotherhood dog!
Ah, one of you again, eh? You Dark Brotherhood types are all the same. All sneak and no swing! You'll meet the same fate as the others! En garde!
I might know that, for a price.
Yeah, we got him here. Argonians aren't allowed visitors though. Countess Alessia's orders. She has a thing about the lizard folk.
We arrested that miscreant. The stupid lizard tried to blackmail the Countess. I wouldn't waste much time thinking about him any more.
You made it work?
That's fantastic! Not only can I tell Irlav we're back on track, but I can happily say we did it without his help!
There must be something down there worth locking up. Would you mind taking a look, as long as you're here?
If I can send you back with something worthwhile, Irlav may forget all about our delays.
It's connected to the rest of the chamber, we know that much. We just don't know how it works.
I've given up trying to figure it out. It's just beyond us. Why Denel stays down there, I have no idea. He's just asking to get killed.
That's what we're calling it, only because we don't know what it really is. Or was.
It's magical - we know that much. Enchanted somehow. We think it's a lock of some sort, but haven't been able to figure out how it works.
All I can say for sure is that it reacts to magic. Badly, most of the time. Several mages were hurt attempting to cast spells at it.
It's at the bottom of the ruins, if you wish to try your luck. Be careful, though. It could be quite hazardous to your health.
Best to play it safe. No complex magic. Stick to basic spells with single effects. It's not worth taking unnecessary risks.
You're the one with the book. You tell me how it works!
I don't know what else to say. Until we have some sort of reference for understanding these symbols, we'll never figure this thing out.
I don't know how much Skaleel told you. We know that it reacts to magic, but every time we've tried, the thing shocks whomever cast the spell.
It hasn't been fatal for anyone yet, but we stopped trying after the first few attempts. I can tell you, it really hurts.
The only thing we haven't figured out is the markings. See them on the walls? They must relate to the pillar, but I don't know how.
If we had some sort of reference, something to compare them to, we might be able to decipher them. But we lack anything like that.
Skaleel might have a book that would be useful, but she's been sulking over the way Irlav's been treating her. Perhaps you could ask her for it?
Then I'll have to ask you to leave the way you came in. The guild is conducting official research here, and I can't have anyone interfering.
Irlav sent you, did he? Figures.
He can't be bothered to come check on his own project, so he sends someone who knows nothing about it. And this is supposed to help?
No offense to you, friend. It's not your fault. And perhaps you can help.
If you can figure out how to use the pillar, I'd be thrilled. You're welcome to try your hand at it.
As I said, I fully understand. I shall be here when you feel you are prepared.
Very well. There's a research project going on at one of the Ayleid ruin sites on the eastern side of the province.
Irlav Jarol is in charge of the project, and is apparently in need of some help.
I thought you might need a break, after the things you've been exposed to lately. You can find Irlav here in the Arch Mage's Tower.
I thought you might need a break, after the things you've been exposed to lately. You can find Irlav in the Arch Mage's Tower.
She's the mage heading up the on-site research. She can tell you more about whatever it is that's impeding their progress.
He's a good man, but Council matters have distracted him lately, and he's been neglecting his other work.
With the mystery solved, we can explore the rest of the ruins and see if there's further information we can divulge from them.
Maybe now that the project has had some positive results, we can go home.
I'd give just about anything to sleep in a real bed again.
This place has been nothing but trouble, as far as I'm concerned.
Since we disposed of the creatures that had taken up residence here, it's been nothing but a fight to figure out how the place works.
The pillar has had us stumped for more than a week now, not to mention the injuries it's caused.
Good work getting that straightened out. I'm glad someone finally came along that was able to make progress with it.
I've had my fill of the place, that's for sure. And I've got the scars to prove it.
Once we figured out the pillar reacted to spells, we tried out a few. I think I was only unconscious for an hour or so, but that was enough for me.
I'm trying to help Skaleel as best I can, but I'm not going near the thing again.
You should speak to Skaleel before you do anything else. She's in charge of the project.
It's an Ayleid ruin, southwest of Cheydinhal. We suspect there are some interesting things inside, so a research project was established.
Skaleel is there now, working on investigating the ruins.
Well then. It seems you still have a job to do.
My ring! All thanks to the claws of the Clan Mother. You have recovered it.
Is that slimy Argonian dead? Did he suffer long? I hope so.
You have earned the reward. The Thieves Guild was always good to Ahdarji's dearest mate. I am grateful that the memory is still honored.
Do not worry, milady. No harm shall come to your ring if I can help it.
It's of no consequence. I'll just have to remember to remove it every night. It's your job to make sure my jewelry box is locked each night.
I'm so happy for you, milady. I'm just so sorry he damaged it. Your finger swells up so when you wear it too long.
I feel so much better now that I have my ring back.
That filthy Argonian actually had the temerity to try and ransom it to me!
Sunlit freedom! Yes, I stole that ring from Ahdarji. When I went to sell it, the fence told me I was too hot for him.
He showed me an inscription on the inside, 'To Alessia.' That had to be the Countess of Leyawiin. The damn ring was stolen property!
Well, I figured I would ransom it back to the Countess. Except she tricked me. I was arrested for theft, and she kept the ring.
The Countess rarely leaves the castle. Good luck getting it back.
I'd look in the Lonely Suitor. She takes her meals there. If you try her house, don't pick the lock to get in. She won't like that.
Uh... she left town. That's right! She... uh... went to visit her brother in Bruma. You should go there and look for her.
Are you deaf? Didn't I already tell you that she is in Bravil?
Well what are you waiting for? Go get some! I'm not tellin' you a thing until I've got one in my hand.
And what good will money do me when they come to stretch my neck? Find a way to get me out of here. Then we'll talk.
Besides, you're a thief. You'd just sell the ring and let me swing.
You'd do that for me? Maybe you guild types aren't so bad after all. Okay. It's a deal. Give me a lockpick and I'll tell you about the ring.
You mean with the Thieves Guild? Sure, that way I'll be a member in good standing when they put my head on a pole!
Are you an idiot? I want you to get me out of here! I don't want a stinking guild membership.
Why should I tell you where it is? Here I sit in Leyawiin's dungeon while you are free. What will you do for Amusei if I tell you?
Go see Servatius Quintilius. He's new and might be stupid enough to try and do something about it.
Go see Hieronymus Lex. He's a pompous fool, just like you. He might listen to your complaint.
It is very near, don't worry. We await only the Master's word before we throw open the gates to Oblivion.
When Lord Dagon Himself walks the earth, our victory will be complete. He will rule over Tamriel and the Mythic Age will be restored.
Against all hope, Martin cast him back into Oblivion! He will not trouble our world for long years to come.
The daedra Prince of Destruction. An inveterate foe of all mortal races.
He was involved with Jagar Tharn's plot against the empire years ago. It doesn't surprise me to find his hand in the current calamity.
We have been preparing for the coming of Lord Dagon for many years. You come to us at a fateful time.
The Master has promised us that the Time of Preparation is almost over! The Time of Cleansing is almost here!
It will be glorious when the smoke of the burning cities rises to blind the eyes of the false gods! Their reign over Tamriel is almost over.
He's never around when you need him. And he never attends services anymore. If he's not careful, he may find himself on the altar one day soon.
Patience. We will see Lord Dagon walk the earth with our own eyes. Nothing can stop us now.
When will the Master order the Cleansing to begin? Everything is ready. The door is unlocked. We just need to throw it open for Lord Dagon to enter.
I hear that everything is ready for the Cleansing to begin. Sister Orla has seen the gate citadels. Lord Dagon is mustering His finest troops.
I can't find Brother Jerrol. I need something out of the storeroom. Have you seen him?
Be glad to. Here, let me have your map and I'll mark the spot for you.
Sure, I know what that is. Any sailor worth his weight in sea salt could tell you.
The Mouth of the Panther is what they call the delta where the Panther River meets Niben Bay.
It got its name from the pointed rocks that jut out of the water there... sort of look like teeth. Mouth, panther, teeth... get it?
Ships are always careful to stay away from it, especially when its foggy on the Bay. The rocks would tear right through a ship's hull like parchment.
I'm surprised Itius. I didn't think even you would stoop to arresting a fellow Captain.
Thank you for coming forward, citizen.
This is the second complaint against Audens. I will personally go and arrest him.
She didn't, huh? Hmph. But, you've taken care of the problem, and I suppose that's what counts. Thanks for that. Here's your payment.
I knew it! That s'wit! Oh, I'll get her. You just wait! Must have taken some fast talking to get her to confess!
Maybe I can teach you a little bit more about how to talk to people. And, of course, here's the payment for the contract. Thank you.
You what? Well, I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. I would never go skulking about....
Fine. You've got me. I figured if I left some rotten meat outside, the nasty little things would come out, and the guards would take care of them.
A mountain lion? In my basement? But... how? That's not possible. But, it happened! What if there are more? What if it wasn't alone?
Where there's one, there will be more. Find Pinarus Inventius. He's a hunter, and knows this area inside and out. He'll know what to do.
Mountain lions! In her basement? I just wanted to lure her vermin outside! I didn't mean to hurt anyone, except the rats. Please, don't tell her!
And, if you can keep this our little secret, I can make it worth your while. There's a bit about acrobatics I can teach you. Give it some thought.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're accusing me of, but don't do it without any proof!
You think you've gotten rid of them all? You do? Well, you haven't! There's one in my basement right now! Go get it!
Mountain lions? Here? Odd. If they're around, I can find them. Come with me. A hunt will do us good, and maybe make that old nut feel better.
She's the one. She's never liked me or my sweet little pets. I know it's her. I've even seen her sneaking around in back of my house at night.
She thinks she's so smart. She and all the other women. I'll show her! I want you to keep an eye on her. Find out what she's up to.
I do not know. The catacombs of Sancre Tor were sealed by the first Grandmaster of the Blades.
The four mightiest Blades of Tiber Septim's day, Alain, Valdemar, Rielus, and Casnar, went to Sancre Tor and never returned.
Here, this is the key to Sancre Tor's outer door. I fear I am sending you to your death, but we have no other choice. You must succeed.
No. He departed long ago. But his evil will remains, preventing any from paying homage at the Shrine of Tiber Septim.
Over the uncounted years of our slavery here, we have brooded over our defeat. I believe that we can undo the Underking's evil magic.
I go now to complete my duty to my lord Tiber Septim. Free my brothers, and together we may be able to lift the Underking's curse. Farewell!
My three companions and I were sent here by the Emperor Tiber Septim to discover what evil had defiled the holy catacombs of Sancre Tor.
We did not know that the Underking, who was Zurin Arctus, had arisen to take his first revenge upon his former lord.
The Underking defeated and ensnared us in his evil enchantment, and bound us here to guard forever the defiled Shrine of Tiber Septim.
I was Alain, loyal Blade of Emperor Tiber Septim. I do not know how long I have been dead. It feels like an eternity.
I was Rielus, loyal Blade of Emperor Tiber Septim. I do not know how long I have been dead. It feels like an eternity.
I was Valdemar, loyal Blade of Emperor Tiber Septim. I do not know how long I have been dead. It feels like an eternity.
I was Casnar, loyal Blade of Emperor Tiber Septim. I do not know how long I have been dead. It feels like an eternity.
All we can do is prepare for them to come out. Once they do, it'll be our best chance to get the drop on them.
Of course, since we can't get inside, we don't know how strong their numbers are, or whether we really have a chance at this.
Traven sent word that he wanted you in charge, so you've got it. You're in command. Tell us where you want us.
If I may, I'd suggest that you put us in the best possible positions based on our abilities. But it's up to you.
What other choice did I have? We were too exposed, standing around outside the door. I lost one of my men already, and I wasn't willing to lose more.
Rolis tried to make it through the door - he's the one that realized this wasn't going to work. One of their patrols spotted us, and Rolis went down.
So we're stuck. All we can do is wait for them to come out. Then they can't hide any more than we can, and it evens the odds quite a bit.
A contingent of Battlemages has been sent to the site. I would like you to oversee their actions on my behalf.
The only thing that matters is that gem. Do you understand?
Once you have it safely in your possession, return here immediately.
Know that you have my complete confidence. I would not entrust this job to you if I did not feel you were prepared for it. Now, go.
No... I have need of it. I believe it may be instrumental in saving our guild.
I will explain once you have returned with it. Until then, discussion is useless.
I've spoken with several individuals I cannot name at this time. Count Hassildor has also provided valuable information, as you well know.
You've failed, mortal. I didn't figure you had it in you. Weakling. Pathetic piece of filth. Leave, before I make you sorry you ever came here.
But, you'll still get your prize, won't you? I think it was worth it... don't you? Keep up the good work, little mortal.
Well, it seems you've accomplished the task set out for you. Well done. Another man damned. Another ruined soul.
You will let him kill you with this: the Cursed Mace. As you are doing this for me, I'll save your miserable life. Probably. Get out of my sight.
He has sworn an oath: never to raise a weapon against another man again. I want him to break that oath, and damn himself forever.
Near Brindle Home you will find Melus Petilius. A good man. An honorable man. He disgusts me.
Another mortal come to do my bidding. I only wish suffering and death. You will bring me both. I want to see a man brought to the edge. And pushed.
Wait. Yes. The Amulet was given to mortals by Akatosh... it contains His divine power...
But how to use this power against Dagon? The Amulet was not intended as a weapon...
... I have an idea. One last hope. I must reach the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One.
I didn't really need the Amulet to tell me that. I've known it was true since you first told me back in Kvatch.
But it is one thing to talk of becoming Emperor, and quite another to actually be the Emperor.
Yes, of course. What am I waiting for?
After all, this is my destiny. No man can deny his destiny.
Belongs to me? The Amulet of Kings?
So you and Jauffre have said. If it is true, if the Emperor really was my father, then I should be able to wear it.
Only those of the Septim blood can wear the Amulet of Kings.
You did it. You defeated him. Then you have it... you have the Amulet of Kings?
Come. Your Blades are waiting to greet you.
Blades! Dark times are upon us. The Emperor and his sons were slain on our watch. The Empire is in chaos.
But there is yet hope. Here is Martin Septim, true son of Uriel Septim!
Your Highness. The Blades are at your command. You will be safe here until you can take up your throne.
Well, then. Thank you, Martin.
We'd all best get back to our duties, eh, Captain?
Ah, well, thank you! The honor is mine.
Jauffre.
All of you.
I know you all expect me to be Emperor. I'll do my best. But this is all new to me.
I'm not used to giving speeches. But I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here.
I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days. That's it. Thank you.
My lord! Welcome to Cloud Ruler Temple! We have not had the honor of an Emperor's visit in many years!
Have you reconsidered? Are you ready to join our order in service to the Dragon Blood?
The Blades are sworn to the service of the Emperor, as the mortal representative of the Dragon Blood of the divine Talos.
Very well. Many serve the Empire in their own way. But we would be honored to have you, if you change your mind.
It is my honor to welcome you into our ranks as a Knight Brother of the Blades.
It is my honor to welcome you into our ranks as a Knight Sister of the Blades.
The Iron Maiden, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
The Gray Prince is headed up to the Arena as we speak. Go up there and meet him, one Champion to the next. May the Divines have mercy on your soul.
Sir Slaughter, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
Man o' War, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
The Crimson Blade, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
The Messenger of Death, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.

The Spellslinger, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
What do you mean you disagree? That's a bold statement. What proof do you have that Gelebourne was not a vampire?
Yes, I remember Bradon mentioning that name once. He was part of the brotherhood he had created with Raynil.
Raynil will pay for both crimes. Gelebourne was likely another innocent he's slain. I'll make sure Skingrad's city watch hears of this.
What proof of your outlandish accusations have you brought me?
How'd you know about that? Agh... too many people don't know how to keep quiet about official matters. Very well.
The Skingrad city watch informed us that Gelebourne was killed by Raynil not too long ago. Gelebourne was a vampire as well, obviously.
In your absence, I dispatched a runner to Skingrad to let them know they need to clear Gelebourne's name for the record books.
Like Bradon, I think he deserves to have his name clear of wrongdoing.
Gelebourne? That's odd you should mention that name. Raynil told me that he was the last vampire he hunted.
Yes... that's right. Somewhere in Skingrad I believe. He said he tracked Gelebourne down and killed him.
That's apparently why the guards trust him so readily. They had gotten word from Skingrad's city watch about Raynil and his so-called accomplishment.
Well of course it does! It was obviously planted here. Why would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous!
And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case!
He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire?
It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him. The thing that bothers me the most is that I swear I've seen him before.
Of course he says he's never been here.
Look, there isn't much more to say. Please... help me clear my husband's name.
I came home only just a few hours ago. I found the door open, and my Bradon dead. Standing over him was a Dunmer.
I screamed and ran out into the street. Some city watch were nearby and heard me I suppose, as they arrived quickly.
I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark.
The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement.
The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.
Forgive me. I loved my husband dearly, and to lose him this way makes no sense. Anything you can do to help would be wonderful.
This is all happening so fast.
Yes, the vampire hunter. As far as I know, he just showed up recently here in Bruma. Not only that, but he already found a vampire among us.
Apparently, Bradon Lirrian was one of those vile creatures, and Raynil slew him. Kind of strange though. I never figured Bradon to be a vampire.
He seemed to be such a likeable fellow.
Please, you must avenge Bradon.
I knew I'd recognized Raynil! I think when I first met Bradon many many years ago, he introduced me to him.
They were part of some sort of brotherhood. They would roam Cyrodiil in search of legendary treasures and the like.
The only reason he stopped doing that is because we got married, and he wanted to settle down. I'm afraid thanks to Raynil, that time is lost.
I have no idea where he'd be. Just find him, and make him tell you the truth. I swear, he's a liar!
Oh... I see.
I know you meant well... and I suppose there was no need to put your life on the line for a stranger.
I'm sorry, but I have much to do right now. Please excuse me. Oh, and you should inform Carius of this if you haven't already.
I'm glad he's dead. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I think you understand.
I've provided Raynil's description to all of the Bruma soldiers and even dispatched his description to guards in other cities.
However, I'm afraid he's slipped through our fingers. If he's as crafty as he's been up to now, he's probably halfway to Vvardenfell.
You haven't gone to the cave yet? Well, what are you still doing here?
I can't wait to get my hands on Raynil. He'll become very familiar with Bruma's dungeons; or the end of my blade if he doesn't come peacefully.
I'll warn you about one thing. I understand you wanting to help Erline by checking up on Raynil.
We have it on good authority from officials in a neighboring city that Raynil is what he says he is. So I'm not sure what you're trying to prove.
I'm only allowing you to do this investigation, and I use that term very loosely, because Erline is so distraught.
I'm impressed. It only took him a day to track the vampire down. I guess that's why he does it for a living.
I suppose there's no harm in telling you what happened. Word is bound to get around Bruma anyway.
Turns out that Bradon Lirrian is a vampire. Or was. If it wasn't for Raynil Dralas, we may never have uncovered the truth. Let me explain.
In the last week or so, we've found two bodies stashed in shallow graves outside the city walls. The bodies had puncture wounds on their necks.
The bodies were those of some beggars who used to wander the streets looking for handouts. Vampire probably thought no one would miss them.
Luckily for us, Raynil arrived in town. He said he was a vampire hunter, so we asked for his help.
He tracked the vampire to this house. When he entered the place around noon, Bradon was sleeping. He was able to slay him at that point.
Luckily, Bradon's wife wasn't home. Poor thing, she didn't even know her husband was infected.
We did a follow up investigation, and it's true that no one recollects seeing Bradon out in the daylight. He's only been spotted at night.
I'm afraid there's not much more to tell you. So, you can see we really don't need any help. But thanks for the offer.
The culprit in this crime has already been dealt with. It's just a matter of wrapping up the details.
I'd tell you more, but frankly, I don't know who you are, so I'm not sure that I can trust you with that sort of information.
I'm sorry, there's been no sighting of him yet. Don't know if there ever will be...
You did what had to be done. There should be no regrets or doubts in your mind about it. Raynil was an evil Dunmer, and he deserved that fate.
No news yet, eh?
Nothing else I can tell you about him. He comes and goes and doesn't talk to people much.
Raynil is staying in the last room down the hall upstairs. Here's the key.
I always liked Bradon and Erline. They were a nice couple. I hope you get to the bottom of this, cause I don't believe he was a vampire either.
He isn't in right now, so you should be clear to check it out. Just don't tell anyone I gave the key to you.
I don't usually give out that kind of information. Especially to people I don't know.
Not sure what happened to him, but I certainly haven't seen him.
Ahhh, you mean that vampire hunter. He's staying over at Olav's Tap and Tack. It's near the city gates; you can't miss it.
Sad that Raynil slipped away like that.
I'm glad that scum got what he deserved. Good riddance.
You must avenge his unjust death.
If all you say is true, Raynil will answer for Bradon's death.
I'm sure Erline is very upset. She'll be safe though; Raynil has confirmed with us that she isn't infected.
Her accusations that Raynil is lying is not surprising. At this point, she's so upset that she'll say anything to deny what really happened.
I suppose if I found out a loved-one was something as horrid as a vampire, I'd find any excuse not to believe it either.
As far as I know, he was a good man. I never saw this coming. But vampires are masters of deception, so I guess it makes sense.
It's ashame that there will be no retribution for Bradon and Gelebourne's deaths, but such is the way of things. I know you did your best.
Although we can't go back and undo what's been done, I feel justice has been served, and Bradon's soul may rest with ease.
Poor fella.
I know I may be out of line by saying this, but I think the city guards may be wrong. It's hard to imagine Bradon was a vampire.
I could have sworn I saw him outside in the daylight before. Unless he just got that disease very recently, I'd say they were mistaken.
When I heard Raynil killed him, I didn't know what to think. But after your visit here, I'm beginning to wonder.
Yes, I suppose it is. Well, then, we've talked enough. Only one of us will walk out of here alive this day. Good luck.
Certainly not. I'm surprised Carius didn't send the entire city watch up here. But then I would have seen that coming I suppose.
I expected to lay low here for a while and then be on my way. So again, I underestimated you.
This leaves me with little choice. Either I fight you now, and have a chance at freedom, or I surrender and rot in a city dungeon.
I prefer the chance for freedom.
Then don't go around, flinging accusation and hearsay. If you dare accuse someone of a crime, you must have the proof to back it up.
Now, if you believe what you're saying is true, go get me the proof!
I... I don't know what to say. It all makes perfect sense now. Why else would Raynil have removed this journal from the crime scene in Skingrad?
I heard no mention of a key either. It must have been removed by Raynil from Bradon's body before we arrived.
To think that two innocent men were killed, and that I'm responsible for one of their deaths... I... I'm speechless.
I will rouse the guard, and begin a search for him in the city. Meet me at Olav's Tap and Tack in one hour.
Ah, well, in all honesty, no. But our wines are very good. And much cheaper than Tamika's very fine product, I assure you.
You contradict me. This conversation is tiresome. Leave me. Or draw your sword.
I'm afraid I cannot. Leave me, and I will spare you.
Try the big goblin den called 'Derelict Mine' out east along the Gold Road.
You heard of 'Goblin Jim's Cave'? It's a big one. It's a long walk due north of Skingrad, in the Imperial Reserve... a long way from civilization.
My advice is to close quick with the skirmishers... the petty spellcasters... but the shamans are real trouble.
Shamans have wicked magics... drains, paralyze... bad stuff. Stand off and shoot or spell shamans down if you can.
That's nothing compared to Morrowind. Thanks.
Let's assume 'no'.
Thanks anyway.
Oh. Nothing. I was just wondering.
The gods don't do a damn thing. Do they even exist? How could anyone tell?
Daedra Lords, sure. They exist. They do things. Bad things, mostly, but things you can see. The gods? They don't do a damn thing.
So why do we build big chapels and sit around and mumble, and ask them to save us from this and that?
It's stupid. And chapels and priests and folks groveling on their knees, they're stupid, too.
Well. Good. I really don't care, either. I just get sick of all the god-talk. Might as well pray to rocks and lamp posts.
Certainly so. Captain Dione knows her business. And no enemy has ever made it over Skingrad's walls.
Well. The guards must've been careless. But Captain Dione has the guard on full alert. We'll be safe.
My sister, Ugak gra-Mogakh, runs the Grateful Pass Stables. She's the quiet one. I'm the talker.
Thank you. I will now speak the word.
No. He always feared this day would come. He left me knowledge of that word in the event that he died and I came into possession of the keys.
If the other members of Bradon's group were still alive, and I on my deathbed, only then would I pass the knowledge onto them.
If you'd give me that amulet, I would like to show you what you've recovered.
Long ago I made a promise to Bradon. I promised to never reveal to anyone what I'm about to reveal to you now.
However, because you've avenged his unjust death, I feel that Bradon would understand why I'm breaking that pact.
Bradon told me about this amulet when they first brought it home from whatever distant land it came from.
He never really trusted anyone else in the group, and before he secured the treasure in that cave, he had a special enchantment placed upon it.
The magic masks the true identity of the item. All it takes is a simple command word, and the amulet would be restored to its true state.
Where is the amulet? I would like to see it again before I can tell you of its true nature.
I grew up here in the Imperial City, but I was born elsewhere. My mother was a servant in the employ of Lord Lovidicus, and resided at his fortress.
Lady Lovidicus was a shrew of a woman. The Lord and my mother grew close, and ultimately fell in love. I was the result of their union.
When the Lady learned of my birth she was furious, and threatened to kill both my mother and me. So we fled, leaving my claim to nobility behind.
Oh! Oh, well of course. You have your own concerns, I'm sure, and I should not have imposed. Please excuse my indiscretion.
Yes, it's what everyone calls me. I guess I'm partly to blame. I've never made it a secret that I'm actually only half Orc.
I am a Lord's son, yet I've been denied the noble privilege to which I am entitled. So I have become the Gray Prince, noble in my own right.
Still... If I could prove who I really am, and show the world that an Orc can be noble in blood as well as deed... Maybe... Yes! You could help me!
Dragonheart, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
The Tamriel Terror, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
Lady Luck, huh? I like it! Yeah, that'll do nicely. All right, it's time to see if you're crazy good or just plain crazy.
Alright. Anything I can do for you, just let me know.
God's blood! So she was the spy? It seems there's no one you can trust these days.
My mother died recently. Before she passed, she gave me this key, and told me it would "unlock the truth," at the place of my birth, Crowhaven.
Crowhaven is a ruined fort far to the west of here. I'd go myself, but my training regiment doesn't allow for the luxury of such an excursion.
My friend, you must travel to Crowhaven and use the key to unlock whatever it is that holds the proof of my birthright!
Find this proof and return it to me, and I'll share with you some of my finest combat techniques. Trust me, you can't learn these moves in a book!
Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble. Go to Crowhaven, to the west. Take this key. It unlocks... something that holds proof of my birth.
I wonder if Mephala herself knows how many lives this foul blade has taken over the years? I will be glad to give the world a respite from it.
Good work. But you must locate their base and make sure you've eliminated all of them.
We'll hold here until you're ready. Although I'd rather not sit around waiting to see what else comes out of that gate.
Alright. Give me a minute to talk to the men. Everyone's a bit jumpy right now.
As I expected. I accept your challenge! Speak to Ysabel and let her know when you're ready, and I shall make for the Arena. Shinji be with us both!
Yes. Yes... I accept your challenge. Go... Go speak with Ysabel. Tell her you're ready. Then we'll... We'll meet in the Arena. Yes, that'll do...
Oh! Oh, well... All right then. I was hoping you'd complete your journey to Crowhaven first, but it is your right to challenge me.
I accept the challenge, of course. Speak with Ysabel, tell her you're ready. Then we'll meet in the Arena and prove our mettle as warriors.
You don't? Oh... Well, all right. I'm sorry, it's just that I fully expected a challenge! It is your right. If you change your mind, I'll be ready.
You don't? Oh... Well I can only hope you'll change your mind. In the Arena... Yes, in the Arena anything could happen. Anything...
You don't? Oh! Well good! Very good indeed! Maybe after you've helped me out, eh? So please, make haste to Crowhaven! This waiting is unbearable!
I'm the reigning Grand Champion of the Arena, you see. Once you become a Champion, you'll need to challenge me for my title.
It's a fight to the death, so if you progress that far and want a shot at the Grand Championship, you'll have to try and kill me.
Well, if it was Ugak, you can be sure she had some good animals.
The sisters are hard to tell apart. It's Ugak you'll want to find if you need a mount, though.
The Two Sisters is a fine place, and the two sisters themselves are nice people, too.
I've always liked the place. Mog does a nice job, although I sometimes confuse her with Ugak.
Yes, the West Weald is a nice place. Just stay away from Erina when she's in a mood.
I like the West Weald itself, but I'd rather avoid its proprietor.
I wouldn't mind making a few bets, but I'm not sure about Graklak. He seems a bit slick to me.
I'll stay away from the topic with her.
Religion is definitely not a topic to bring up around Else. Swords, on the other hand, she'll talk about.
Colovian Traders is a good shop. Perhaps I'll visit Gunder soon.
I've bought a number of things from Gunder. I've always been satisfied.
There's just something wrong with that guy. And he has an odd smell about him.
I'd stay away from him if I were you. There's something very wrong with that man.
It's a shame such a good smith wastes her life in the bottle.
She can drink all she wants as long as she keeps doing such fine work.
Tumindil does excellent work. I always feel comfortable in his care.
It's good to know that if I'm sick, I can head to Tumindil.
No one works harder than Marie.
The world needs more folks like Marie.
You'd be better off praying for a miracle than going to see Valandrus.
I think I'd rather take my chances with a disease than have that man try to heal me.
I've heard rumors about him, but I don't believe they're true.
Maybe there's something strange going on, but Skingrad is a well-run city.
He's a tough one, that's for sure. I wouldn't want to cross him.
He's all business. That's probably good in his line of work, though.
It's a bit strange, but Castle Skingrad is an odd place.
I can't imagine it. Still, it's better than not having a butler at all.
I don't think he's that impressive. There's no telling him that, though.
I can't stand someone who's so full of himself. Someone needs to teach him a lesson.
I'm glad he's doing it. Those things are disgusting, a menace to us all.
Goblins are filth. More power to him.
That's good to know. You can never be too careful.
I've heard that about Fadus. He's quite impressive.
The more folks hunting goblins, the better. That's what I say.
If Parwen wants to spend all day hunting goblins, I think it's great. Those things are a menace.
I've got no interest in talking about some snooty mage.
That's so typical for a mage.
All that conjuring gives me the creeps. There are plenty of scary things in this world without bringing more around.
I don't want to learn how to conjure things. I want to learn how to get rid of things.
I wouldn't mind learning a bit about Mysticism. Seems like a useful skill.
Mysticism? Seems interesting, but not particularly useful.
I'll keep that in mind the next time I need something recharged. Not that it's something that happens every day, of course.
I've never used his services. I mean, how many people have enchanted things just lying around? Outside of the guild, of course.
That's just what this town needs: another reckless mage.
He should be kicked out of town before one of his experiments turns this place into a wasteland.
He's a moron. One of these days, he'll be taught a lesson.
What a fool. I hope he's happy with himself.
I can't imagine who'd want to hurt Toutius.
I'm sure it's just a rumor. I can't think of a reason why anyone would want to hurt Toutius.
Salmo's baking is fantastic. And her sweetrolls are unbeatable.
I could eat nothing but Salmo's baking for the rest of my life. That'd be fine with me.
If I could use a shield as well as Ambrose, I'd charge people for training, too.
I've heard he's the best in town with a shield. If you want to learn, go to him.
You can never be too good with a bow. I know I'm not.
I've heard that Reman is good with a bow. Apparently, he's the best in all of Skingrad.
Can't say I like tomatoes. I'm sure Undena's are good, though.
To-MAY-to. To-MAH-to. DAY-dra. DEE-dra. It's all the same to me.
No doubt about it, the man loves cheese. And sheep. Just cheese and sheep.
I like cheese. Not more than sheep, though. I'm not sure about Uuras.
She's a hard worker, and they make some fine wine.
I've heard she works long hours. It's worth it, though. That's some fine wine.
I've heard he's good with his bow, and he'll train you, for a price. I like the wine he makes, too.
With all that time in the vineyard, it's a wonder he has time to practice his marksmanship.
The Surilie Brothers wine is some of the best in Tamriel, if you ask me.
No doubt, they make a fine wine at the Surilie Vineyards.
Gaston and his brother produce quality wines. I'll have to pick up some more.
I don't know Gaston well, but I helped him drink his wine. And he always has a mighty fine wine.
He's got some issues, that's for sure. Personally, I'd just steer clear of him.
He is a bit nutty. Probably just a harmless old fool, though.
Her wines are excellent, and she's a fine person as well.
I'll have to buy a bit more of her wine. It's just excellent. A fine choice for any meal.
I don't usually take bribes, but I'll look the other way just this once. If I see you again though, I'll have to arrest you.
Very well. I'm sure someone else will want it if you don't.
Okay, it's your gold.
Very well. Let me know if you change your mind.
Fine. One less thing for me to clean up afterwards.
Then stop wasting my time.
All right, but you're missing out. It's a fine room, and to be honest, you look like you could use some rest.
Oh. All right then. Let me know if you change your mind.
I don't have much of a sense of humor, so if this is a joke, I'm not amused. Come back when you have the money.
Good. The room is on the second floor, right across from the stairs. Sleep soundly.
No money, no room. I'm running a business here.
Very well. Room number two, just near the entrance. If you need food or drink, let me know.
Trying to take advantage of a sick woman? You're horrible. Come back when you actually have the money for it.
Very well. Go through that door up the stairs, and it'll be the first door on the right. Sleep well, if you can.
I'm afraid I can't rent you the room if you can't afford it. Sorry.
All right. It's up the stairs; the last door on your right. Sleep well.
You don't have the money for the room. Perhaps some other time.
Walk just up the stairs there, and it's the door on the right. Thank you.
You don't have the money. I'm not just going to let you sleep here for free.
Very well. You can use either bed on the top floor. Oh, and do watch your step.
So be it. Head upstairs, and look for the last door on your right. That's your room for tonight. Sleep well.
You don't have the money, so I can't let you stay in the room. I'm sorry.
I don't care much for jokes. If you're serious about the room, come back with some gold on you.
A wise choice, indeed. You've never had a night's rest like this, I assure you.
The room is down below deck. It's the door on the left.
If you don't have the gold, then I don't have a room. I'm sorry.
Right! You'll have to go upstairs to the second floor. Your room is the second door on the right before the staircase. Thank you for your patronage.
You don't seem to have the money for the room. Perhaps you should look elsewhere for accomodations.
Very good. It's up the stairs there, first door on your left. Sleep well.
I'm afraid you lack the funds to rent a room. Perhaps you should consider resting somewhere else?
Excellent. The room is on the floor upstairs, at the west end of the hall. I do hope you rest well.
The room's up the stairs, and it'll be the first door on your left.
Come back when you actually have the money for it.
I'm not about to rent you a room if you can't pay for it.
Very well. Head up the stairs, and it's the last door on your right. Sleep well.
Excellent. I'm sure you'll be quite satisfied.
Go upstairs, and look for the door on the right at the end of the hall. Sleep well!
Fine. Take the stairs up to the right, the room on the left. No visitors allowed. And no pets.
This here's a respectable establishment! Come back when you've got the money.
Very good! Your room is waiting. Upstairs, last door on the right. Thanks again, and have a wonderful stay!
Look, friend, I'm not running a flophouse here. No gold, no room. No exceptions.
You do not have the money for me, so I do not have a room for you.
Up the stairs you must go, to the first door on your right. That is your room for the night.
I'm afraid that's not possible, since you don't seem to have the money for it. We'll be happy to accomodate you, when you can afford it.
Of course you will. You'd be silly not to.
It's just up the stairs there. Second floor, the east wing. All the comforts of home.
I thought it was pretty clear that you need money to rent a room. Come back when you have some.
Okay then. Room number one, right next to the entrance. Sleep well.
The room is upstairs, first door to the left. Sleep well.
I can't let you have it for free, I'm afraid. Come see me when you have some money.
You don't even have the money! Why are you wasting my time? Is this some sort of joke to you?
It's upstairs, second door on the left. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Excellent. It's just down the stairs there. The door is impossible to miss. I'm sure you'll sleep very well.
Well, I must say. You have some nerve, attempting to swindle me out of a night's stay. If you've no gold, I suggest you find alternate lodging.
Right then. Head up the stairs, and it's the first door on your right. Remember, I didn't say it was clean. I said it was cheap.
Not even 10 gold to your name? And here I thought I had it bad. Sorry, but I need you to pay before I can let you stay here.
The room's yours for the night. It's just upstairs, the first door on the left. Sleep well.
I don't run a halfway house, you know. When you have the money, then you can have the room.
All right, then. You're all set. Remember, first door on your left.
Come on, now. The room is only 10 gold. Surely you can afford that?
It's upstairs on the top floor. Only room I've got. I think both beds should be clean enough, so use whichever you prefer.
I'm not running a charity here, you know? I need the gold, so you come back when you actually have it.
Okay then. It's upstairs, the room at the west end of the hall. That's to your right when you come out the door. Enjoy.
No gold, no room. Sorry, but that's the way it goes. I don't make exceptions.
Head downstairs, and the room will be straight across from the door. Sleep well.
Unless you can pay for it, you're not staying in one of my rooms.
Excellent. It's up the stairs there, and then directly across the hallway. Center room, wonderful view of the city. Sleep well!
I'm afraid you lack the funds for the room. Perhaps someplace else would suit you better?
When you've got the money for it, then maybe I'll consider letting you have a room.
Right then. Up the stairs in the back, and it's the last door at the end of the hall, straight ahead of you after turning that corner.
Right! Okay... It is with great honor that I present to you this gold, and the esteemed Raiment of Valor, and name you the new Arena Grand Champion!
You've done it! The Gray Prince was a great Orc, rest his soul and all that... but you beat him! Ha ha!
Now go! Take some time to rest! When you're feeling up to it, come talk to me again and we'll discuss your future!
She holds public audience in the Great Hall on weekday mornings. If you need to speak to her, that's the time to do it.
Mornings she is at the town chapel. At the castle, she hosts the evening meal at eight. She retires sometime after eleven.
She travels to Chorrol on the Ides of every month. Don't even try to find her between the 15th and 17th.
I don't think I like that question. Are you planning something nefarious? Why don't you just go away.
No! Let her go!
Then go, Syl. Return to your quarters. Before I send you back in pieces.
Fool? Visionary! Change is in the air, Syl. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later.
Calm yourself, Syl. You're making my teeth itch. You still hold your office. I suggest you see to your duties.
Hold your tongue, little Duchess, or I'll tear it from your mouth.
This is not over, Madgod. I give myself to Jyggalag. As a Priest of Order, I'll be safe. Your empire will crumble before the armies of Order.
Yes! That's what I'll do. I'll go. The enemy of my enemy. Order is the key. I'll keep them close.
No. I can't do this. There has to be a way out. A way to escape.
Order stands at our door. They've taken the Fringe! Did you even know? Do you care? And you speak of "change"?
No! I see what's going on. I should have seen it before. You conspire to destroy us all! You're a fool if you think I'll allow this to happen.
Replacing Thadon with this... outsider? This is how it ends. I should have seen this coming.
Thadon... dead? You've done this. It was you all along!
We are a farming community. Nothing more. Nothing less. That is, when I can get these layabouts to actually put in a day's work.
Relan is the only one around here worth a damn. And that's only because he loves to kill his pests.
Watch yourself while you're here. Cindanwe is out for us. She cares for nothing but work, and she keeps us as slaves!
This looks like a farm, doesn't it? That's what they want you to think. Truth be told, these plants are monsters. They sleep... below the water.
They dream terrible dreams and one day soon, they will rise up, consume us and the rest of the Shivering Isles. Get out while you can!
It's nice here. Lots of pests for Relan. Lots of blood.
A fellow Argonian. How good to see. Were you anyone else, I would require a test before offering you training, but it's one I'm sure you could pass.
I am at your service. If you need Alteration training, I am here for you.
It is too late in the day to begin your test now. Return tomorrow before 1 PM, and we shall discuss it then.
Are you ready to begin your test now?
We will not speak of training here. When I have settled myself in my favorite spot in the bay, then we shall talk. Follow me there, if you wish.
Well, here we are. If you wish to learn what I know about Alteration, then you must stay here with me for a full three hours.
How you manage to do this is up to you; do not wander off, or I shall consider this test of your ability failed. Are you prepared to begin now?
Would you learn from me? Then meet me during the day, out under the waves in the bay.
You should track down Rusia Bradus in Anvil, and see if she can teach you anything more.
I can't teach you anything you don't already know. But there is someone who might be able to...
You'd never know it by looking at her, but Rusia Bradus did a lot of traveling in her younger days. She must have been in pretty good shape.
Travel to the Arcane University, and speak with Martina Floria.
Martina Floria at the Arcane University has truly mastered Illusion spells. You should speak with her about training further.
Travel to the Imperial City, and speak with Palonirya.
Palonirya is one of the wealthiest traders in Cyrodiil. Her shop in the Imperial City is so successful. If anyone can teach you more, she can.
Speak with Oleta, at the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch. She will be able to train you further.
Oleta was the most gifted healer I've ever known. If anyone can teach you more, she can.
She worked in the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch. I haven't seen her in quite some time.
We'll try again, I suppose. What does the name Hazadir mean to you?
Mighty bold of you, asking for training. What makes you think you're worth my time?
I bet you don't know the first thing about smithing. Have you read up on the history of the craft? I doubt it.
You answer a simple question, and I'll think about training you. So here it is: What does the name Hazadir mean to you?
If you want to learn more about training Destruction magic, you'll have to find Bralsa Andaren.
The only way you can learn more about Destruction magic now is to find Bralsa Andaren. She can train you better than anyone.
Good luck finding her, though. The latest I heard was that she had wandered off into the wilderness, looking for a shrine to Kynareth.
You're very skilled with Destruction magic; I just don't feel comfortable talking about this with you.
If you want to know more, there's one person I can think of to teach you, though she's a bit... odd. You'll need to find Bralsa Andaren.
Best mage I've ever seen, but a bit eccentric. Last I heard, she had camped out at a shrine to Kynareth, and was killing wildlife for fun, I think.
You certainly know your Destruction spells. I wish I could be of more help, but... I just don't feel comfortable talking about it.
I've heard word of your great deeds. It's good to meet someone else striving to be known throughout the land.
We're peas in a pod, you and I. I'd be happy to offer whatever help I can.
I've heard you mentioned in hushed tones. Quite the evil doer, are you? Well, what's infamy but another type of fame, after all.
If you need to improve your skill with a Blade, I'll happily teach you what I know. Imagine how many people will talk if we're seen together?
Until I hear your name spoken by others, don't expect any training from me. When you're known as a hero or a villain, I might change my mind.
Training? From me?
I'm sorry, friend, but I have no idea who you are. Never heard of you. I'm afraid I don't offer training to just anyone.
If you were famous, perhaps... or infamous, I suppose... that might count for something. But, alas, you're not.
Look for Andragil. You can find her living in Bravil.
You want more training? Then you'll have to find Andragil. I learned most of what I know from her.
I think she's living in Bravil these days. You should look for her there.
You've got quite a past, don't you? Left some bloody trails? You tell yourself they all deserved it, right? Ha, ha.
With a body count like that on your head, you're my kind of person. You want training? Fine by me. Be sure and put it to good use.
If you've killed fifty people, it's still not enough for my tastes, but I might reconsider at that point.
Training? From me? Ha ha, you must be joking!
You think you know what it's like to really, truly wield that kind of power? Hmm?
How many people have you killed in your lifetime, eh? Not as many as I, my little friend. When we're equals, you might interest me.
Look for Irene Metrick in the Imperial City. She can do some amazing things with a weapon in her hand.
You want to do as much damage as possible with an axe or a hammer? Find Irene Metrick, and talk to her.
The things she did.... Well, I heard she atoned for her crimes. She might be willing to train you, I suppose.
Find Olyn Seran. Look for him at a Daedric Shrine; that's where he probably is.
I've heard that there's a powerful conjurer off in the woods someplace, worshipping Molag Bal. Olyn Seran, I think his name was.
I personally wouldn't go looking for him myself, but you might keep it in mind if you ever run across him.
Speak with J'bari in Leyawiin. He can teach you all that you need to know.
Head to Leyawiin, and find J'bari. He's the one you want to talk to about Light Armor training.
Find Marana Rian in the Imperial City. She can teach you what you wish to know.
If you need more assistance with your training, seek out Marana Rian in the Imperial City. She uses the shadows like no other I've seen.
Very good.... Very good indeed. The Creators shall take notice soon enough, and then they shall have me to deal with!
You have done your part, so I shall do mine. What I know I will teach you.
You have not done that which I ask. Kill the bears and bring me their hides. Then I shall do as you ask.
You seek training? If I were to aid you, you would first have to assist me. I would strip the Creators of their works... you will help with this.
Bring me 20 bear pelts, as proof that you have helped tear nature asunder. Then we shall speak of spells and teaching.
I am impressed.
You have proven yourself worthy, and have earned my respect. What I know, I shall teach to you for a fee.
Until I see you summon a Faded Wraith here before me, you shall get no training from me.
You would seek training from me?
Well, then my request is small. Prove to me that you are capable of serving Molag Bal in your own way.
Summon a Faded Wraith right here, before me. When I have seen it with my own eyes, you shall be worthy of my teachings.
Talk to Helvius Cecia in Bruma. He's your best bet for learning more about hand to hand combat.
You should consider going to Bruma, and talking with Helvius Cecia. He can teach you more than... well, probably anyone.
You want more training? Then you'll have to go to the best. Marana Rian, here in the Imperial City. She can help you better than I.
Find Tandilwe at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. She can train you further.
Have you ever heard one of Tandilwe's sermons at the Temple of the One? Goodness, that woman knows how to orate.
You should consult her; I'm sure she can give you more training.
Go to the Leyawiin Guild hall, and speak with Dagail. She can train you further.
If you seek additional training, I cannot help. Dagail, however, knows more than anyone in Cyrodiil. You can find her in the Leyawiin Guild hall.
Look at this! How wonderful!
Simply wonderful. I'm hesitant to even open the bottles... oh, thank you for these.
Now, you were after some training? I think I can accommodate you.
Not until you've got those wines for me. I thought I made that clear.
Training? Oh, I'm afraid that's not my area of expertise. I'm very focused on wines right now, you see.
Wonderful thing, wine. It's all about the balance. The flavor, the bouquet, the consistency... just wonderful.
I'm sorry, what? Training... right. I'll make you a deal: you fetch me a bottle of each of the best wines from Skingrad, and I'll think about it.
Both vineyards, Tamika's and Surilie Brothers. Vintage 399. Oh, what a good year that was...
Sinderion in Skingrad is the elf you should speak with. He's a very talented Alchemist.
If you're looking for further training in Alchemy, I suggest you speak with Sinderion. He's quite gifted, although slightly eccentric.
I believe he's working at the West Weald Inn, over in Skingrad. I think Erina tries to keep him out of sight.
I've heard stories of a woman who traveled the world on foot before settling down somewhere in Cyrodiil... Anvil, I think it was.
I believe her name was Bradus? Runia, or Rulia... something like that. If the stories are true, she might be able to train you further.
Martina Floria at the Arcane University has a much better mastery of Illusion spells than I. You should travel there and speak with her.
Well, will you look at that. Quite a bit of gold you have there... so beautiful, isn't it?
Perhaps you are capable of being a decent trader one day. Well, with that kind of money, anyone can be, after all.
I shall be happy to impart to you the knowledge I've gained over the years... for a price, of course. I wouldn't have it any other way.
Show me that you can raise at least ten thousand gold for a business venture, and I'll help you learn how to put it to good use.
Training? Well, my dear, good business sense is just something that comes naturally to me.
You've got to have the know-how, or else I can't teach you anything at all. Do you have what it takes? Do you even know what it takes?
Gold, that's what! Septims, and lots of them! Show me that you've got the starting capital, at least ten thousand in liquid assets.
For advanced training, seek out Oleta. She serves Akatosh at his temple in Kvatch. She can teach you all you need to know.
The death of any helpless individual is tragic, and reprehensible when it could have been prevented. I hold you responsible.
You will receive no training from me. Not now, or ever!
You have seen the beggars. You have, I hope, used your powers of speech to raise their spirits.
Now I can help you to improve those powers, to help make lives better.
There are still poor souls in this world that you have not spoken with. They wait for you.
You would seek to better yourself? First, I would ask that you look to the poor and the suffering around Cyrodiil.
Travel to all of our cities, and speak with the unfortunate souls forced to beg for change. Look into their hearts, and then look into your own.
Return to me when you have spoken with all of them. Then we shall talk of training.
I've told you all I can. Seek out Alawen if you wish to train further with your bow.
You're very good with a bow. It's a shame I can't help you any more. If we were better friends, I might be able to give you one last piece of advice.
You know as much as I do about the art of being a Marksman. There is only one person I know of that is more skilled.
I'm not sure I trust you enough to reveal any more to you.
I can teach you no more. But I myself learned a few tricks from a Wood Elf Hunter; I'm sure she could teach you a few things as well.
Last time I saw Alawen, she was out in the forest east of Anvil, and south of Kvatch. If you look carefully, you might find her there.
There's only one last thing I can say about Marksman training. If you want to be the best, you have to learn from the best.
And the best I've ever seen is an Archer named Alawen. Not sure where she is now; last I heard, she had a camp east of Anvil, out in the forest.
You'll have to find Pranal if you want to learn more. That's all there is to it.
Long ago, I learned much of what I know from a man named Pranal. An excellent teacher, he was. You should consider learning from him.
I met him in Hammerfell, but I understand he moved to Cyrodiil a few years back. The Roxey Inn, I think? You should look there for him.
You're beyond what I can teach. You might think about consulting Sinderion; he knows more about Alchemy than I do.
Head to Skingrad, and visit the West Weald Inn. I believe he's currently employed there. In the wine cellar, in fact.
Well, you do get around, don't you? You've seen a good bit of what the world has to offer, which is more than can be said for most people.
All right, I'll teach you what I know about Athletics. Maybe we can swap stories about life on the road.
I think you still need to do some exploring before you're ready to learn more. Discover a few new places on your own, then come see me.
Oh dear me, are those old stories still going around?
Yes, I did quite a bit of traveling. Back before I met Silgor, and decided to settle down. It's all about pacing yourself.
You should get out there, and experience things for yourself. Discover new places, travel to lands you've never seen.
Maybe once you've done that, we can talk about how to better pace yourself.
If you want to train further, you'll have to seek out someone else. There's nothing I can teach you.
I've heard of a Daedra worshipper named Olyn Seran. Very powerful, and might be helpful, if you can find him.
I heard he had to flee Morrowind, and is now hiding out in the forests of Cyrodiil. If there are other cultists out there, he's probably with them.
Training, eh? The real question is, can you fight?
Ah, ten Welkynd Stones. Most useful for my research. Thank you. And now, I am at your service.
When you can provide me with ten Welkynd Stones, I'll provide you with training.
Hmm. A trade is in order, don't you think? My services in exchange for... oh, let's say ten Welkynd Stones. I'd say that's fair.
Let me know when you have them.
Well, there it is. Not the best job I've seen, but you did it.
All right, I'll help you hone your technique.
You don't have my coin, so you don't get any training. I haven't changed my mind.
A few too many loose lips, it seems. It's not something I want to be public knowledge, if you understand my meaning.
Very well. Simple task for you. I just dropped a favorite coin of mine into my pocket. If you can steal it from me, I'll train you.
Tandilwe has a true mastery of the spoken word. She is the one you should speak with about more training.
Seek her out at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.
You know as much about Mysticism as I do. If you wish to learn more, Dagail can teach you.
Visit her at the Leyawiin Guild hall. But be aware that she's a bit...  odd.
Search the mountains in the northeast of Cyrodiil for Aerin's Camp. Aerin can teach you all that you need to know.
I can't teach you anything you don't already know. Aerin could, though. She's a brilliant acrobat.
Last I heard, she'd set up camp in the mountains, somewhere in the northeast corner of the province. You should look for her there.
Seek out Tooth-in-the-Sea. He can train you further.
Tooth-in-the-Sea can teach you more than I. Search for him north of Bravil, along the coast of Niben Bay. Or perhaps in it, depending on his mood.
I can't teach you anything more. You'll need to train with the best, and the best I know of is Helvius Cecia. If you can get him to agree to it...
He lives in Bruma. You should look for him there.
That looks like the armor I asked for. Well done. That wasn't so hard, was it?
And now, if you need training, I'd be ever so happy to provide it.
If you want training from me, you're going to have to get something for me first.
I need a new Elven cuirass. Nothing fancy, nothing enchanted. Just a decent piece of armor. You get that for me, and I'll train you. That's the deal.
Speak with J'bari here in town. He's good with Light Armor; far better than I.
How very arrogant of you. To think that I would aid you out of the kindness of my heart?
Since you are here, and since you want something, you are useful to me. Travel to Bravil, and speak with S'Krivva. She should have a message for me.
You must find J'baana, and learn from him.
If more knowledge is what you seek, you must consult J'baana. He is wise in the way of locks.
He is a guest of the Legion, at the Legion Headquarters in Cyrodiil. Seek him there.
You came all this way for training from Aerin? You must be really disappointed that she's not here.
Well, I haven't ever seen her, so I guess you're out of luck there. But, if you want... I could train you. I'm pretty skilled myself.
And I could always use the money.
If you're looking to be the best in business, you need to learn from the best. Palonirya is one of the best, so you might try asking her.
She has a very successful shop in the Market District of the Imperial City.
If you need more training, you'd better head to Bravil and track down Andragil. She taught me a few things I didn't know.
Training? Goodness me, I'm retired! I'm afraid combat doesn't interest me any more. All that matters to me now is Malene.
The only one who can teach you anything more about Heavy Armor is Pranal. A master gladiator back in his day, he was.
I think I heard that he'd retired, and was living out his days at the old Roxey Inn here in Cyrodiil. You might try there.
I certainly can't teach you anything more. But if the rumors are true, and Alix Lencolia is passing through Cyrodiil, he might be able to teach you.
He'll be truly famous one day. Word already spreads about his skill... I think someone saw him at Faregyl Inn not too long ago. You should try there.
If you're looking to learn even more, experience is your best bet. If you want pointers, I hear that Alix Lencolia is somewhere in Cyrodiil.
Don't tell me you've never heard of him! He's famous for his skill with a blade. And at his young age.... He'll be a legend one day, mark my words.
I heard that he was on his way to one of the Southern provinces, seeking fame and fortune. Maybe try an inn along the way, like Faregyl.
I've heard tales of a woman who used a blunt weapon in horrible ways people had never seen. Irene Metrick, I think her name was.
If she's not in prison, you might try searching the Imperial City for her. Maybe you can convince her to teach you what she knows.
You have helped to save Kvatch, or what is left of it. For that, I can do nothing less than help you spread healing throughout Cyrodiil.
I shall offer you whatever skill I have.
While Daedra still roam free in Kvatch, I can think of nothing else. When my city is safe, then I will train you.
Your courage is admirable, but now is not the time. Once Kvatch is safe from these attackers, then we might speak of training.
You'll need to convince Gin-Wulm you're worth his time if you want further training.
Much as I hate to admit it, Gin-Wulm knows more about smithing than I do. Says it's in his blood.
You want to be the best? Then you'd better head over to The Best Defense and talk to him. Getting him to train you will be no small feat, though.
The only way you're going to learn anything new now is by doing it yourself, or talking to Gin-Wulm. I'd suggest doing it by yourself.
But if you're dead set on it, head to The Best Defense in the Imperial City. He's a smith there, and might be persuaded to train you.
You have the right equipment. This is good.
Now I can teach you properly.
You wish to learn? Hmm. You have potential, I see, but your equipment!
A true marksman is only as good as his bow. When you have a good, solid Elven bow, then I shall teach you what you need to know.
If you require further training, you might consider venturing into the mountains in the north of Cyrodiil. Aerin's Camp, specifically.
Aerin's a very gifted acrobat, and could teach you anything you needed to know.
If you wish to learn more about Alteration, you'd be wise to consult Tooth-in-the-Sea. If you can find him, that is.
I believe he's currently residing somewhere north of Bravil. Spends most of his time in Niben Bay, I understand. And I do mean IN Niben Bay.
You want training, from me? Well, perhaps I can accommodate you. If you're worth the time and effort, that is. I think a little test is in order.
Only one has a better mastery of locks than I. You need to speak to J'baana. You can find him imprisoned at the Imperial Legion headquarters.
You have done much to prevent the flow of Oblivion into Tamriel. The world is in your debt, and I am at your service. My knowledge is yours.
The barriers between worlds are weak. Close the doors to Oblivion, and then we shall speak of training.
Training, child? You would know more about the mystic energies of the world around us?
The barriers between planes are weak. Do more to strengthen them; seal the portals to Oblivion. Then we shall speak of training.
I am The Stranger. That is all you need to know. That, and I am no-one to be trifled with.
The Five Claws is a very clean place. Witseidutsei wouldn't have it any other way.
Witseidutsei takes great pains to keep that place clean. She doesn't tolerate people messing it up.
She really doesn't seem to like her sisters. Sad, really.
She seems to have real issues with her sisters. I can't imagine why. Shamada is lovely, and Shomara is very sweet.
He has a wonderful collection of books. I don't know why he needs to act so tough all the time.
He's an aggressive one, that's for sure. Has a good book selection, though.
I try not to talk to him. I don't have that kind of time.
All day long, stories about severed heads and lopped off limbs. I can do without it.
I've heard if you're in the Fighters Guild, you can learn a lot from him.
Knowing how to use heavy armor isn't a bad idea. Kind of odd to learn it from a Bosmer, though.
She certainly can handle a blade. A bit of a show-off, if you ask me.
She does love to show off her skill. I suppose you can learn a lot from her, though.
I've heard he knows more about Mysticism than almost anyone. Strange about the sheep, though.
I don't understand the fascination with sheep. Certainly seems to know everything about Mysticism, though.
I've heard he never leaves his laboratory. He's certainly dedicated to his craft.
He's a very hard worker. Sometimes I wonder if he ever gets out.
Vanashti is a frightening one. I've heard she likes the skooma a bit much.
I understand Vashanti has some problems with the skooma. That can't be good for her fighters.
I've eaten many meals there, and I've always been satisfied.
I like the Flowing Bowl. Maenlorn and his brother are excellent hosts.
I enjoy a good bottle of wine, and Wilbur always has a nice selection.
I've had many good meals at the Count's Arms. I've had even more good bottles of wine there.
He's a nice fellow, but he couldn't even get the sign for his store spelled right.
He's not the smartest man, but he's a nice guy. I just hope he can keep his business afloat.
I've never wanted to join up, but I understand Azzan is a good man.
I've heard Azzan is an excellent fighter. I'm not planning on joining up, but if I did, I'd like to work for him.
I understand he's good, but you have to be a member of the Fighters Guild for him to train you.
I don't really have any interest in learning how to use a blunt weapon, but I understand he's very good.
I wouldn't mind learning something, but I don't want to join the Fighters Guild to do it.
You can never know too much about how to handle a sword.
He's quite the pugilist.
I wouldn't want to mix it up with him.
A little skill with a shield can save your life. Of course, she'll only train other Fighters Guild members.
I know that skill with a shield can be invaluable. I don't think I want to join the Fighters Guild to learn, though.
I just don't trust those mages. I especially don't trust ones who can play with your mind like that.
From what I know, Carahil is a powerful mage. I suppose she should be, if she's going to be in the Mages Guild.
Learning a bit about alchemy would be handy, but you have to be in the Mages Guild for Felen to train you.
It might be nice to learn how to make better potions.
Those Destruction spells are dangerous. I hope the Mages Guild keeps a tight lid on that.
Destruction spells can cause a lot of damage. Knowing enough could make you a dangerous person.
I've heard that Mirabelle spends a lot of time with the sailors. A lot of personal time with them.
I've heard a lot of stories about the Fo'c's'le. None of them good.
He's in great shape, that's for sure. Maybe he could teach me something about his training regimen.
He's an odd one. Drinks like a fish, but runs like a rabbit.
You don't see a lot of Human-Bosmer marriages. I don't know if it's even legal in Cyrodiil.
I don't know what would possess him to do that. Marrying a Bosmer is just wrong.
Pinarus is an impressive tracker. I'd like to see if he can teach me a bit about using a bow.
You could learn a lot from Pinarus.
That woman is a bit off-kilter. I don't even want to know what she's got in her basement.
She's a nut. Whatever's going on in that house, I don't want to know about it.
She travels a lot to research her books. She's in great shape from all that travel. Maybe she'd teach me a bit about getting into shape.
She seems like a good person to talk to. I imagine she could teach me a lot.
Well, there's one man who seems to care: Garrus Darelliun, the second in command of the guard. I hear he isn't happy with Ulrich.
I don't know what you can do for us in this situation. I mean, Ulrich is the Captain after all. Perhaps you could speak to Garrus.
You can find him roaming the County Hall of the castle most of the time.
The Count? He could care less about our plight. As long as the roast suckling pig is delivered to his feast table, he's as happy as can be.
Ever since Ulrich Leland took over the Captain of the Guard post, this city's gone downhill. It's getting almost scary to walk the streets.
The guards have imposed new, ridiculously heavy fines for every infraction under the sun. They almost seem to make up laws just for charging fines.
If you can't pay the fine, they can take your property away or toss you in the castle dungeons. Nothing we can do about it really.
If you're interested, go talk to Llevana Nedaren. She seems the most outspoken against Ulrich and his new fines.
Oh, please. Don't even get me started. That madman won't be satisfied until everyone in town is dead broke... or in jail!
What in Oblivion is Ulrich doing with all that money anyway? I'm sure he's lining his pockets with the gold of the good citizens of Cheydinhal.
Take my good friend Aldos Othran for example. In the last month, he's been fined six times! SIX! All for being drunk and disorderly.
Have you ever gone past a guard barracks? When are they NOT drunk and disorderly? What kind of a stupid fine is that?
Well, Aldos couldn't pay the last two fines, so they seized his home and threw him into the street until he could pay it! Bastards!
I'll go nowhere with you, fetcher! Nowhere!
You s'wit! How dare you! Ulrich be damned! He can take his fine and stuff it up his backside!
I said move! Or by my ancestors I'll put you on the ground with a split lip!
This is my house! Get out of the way... move, I say!
You've been warned. You are now under arrest. Please, come with me.
Sir, I must warn you that threatening a city guardsman is an offense punishable by a fine of no less than 50 gold. Pay or be jailed.
Sir, this property has been seized by his lordship, the Count of Cheydinhal. Leave immediately.
Honestly, she's never done anything to be fined or get in trouble... yet. The person I'd love to bring in as a witness is Aldos Othran.
That is, if we could sober him up for five minutes.
I haven't approached him myself, as Ulrich has eyes everywhere. However, he doesn't know you well enough yet to suspect anything.
If you want to help, you need to get Aldos to agree to become a witness. Nothing else can be done.
Ha! That stupid s'wit! Throw me out of my home, will he? I'll show him a thing or two about messing with an Othran!
All I did was fall down, sure. Maybe even vomited on the floor of the tavern. Charge me six times, Ulrich... charge me you fetcher??!
Well, I'm not standin' for this any more. You come with me and I'll show you what the Othrans can do when their backs are to the wall.
Justice has been done. Go tell Garrus what's transpired here. I await my fate.
I'll deal with him soon enough.
I don't know where the Count found him, but I sure wish he'd send him back. He's a menace to this town.
Don't be upset. I knew what I was doing the moment I asked you to lead Ulrich to me. I was fully aware of the consequences.
Given the opportunity, I think Ulrich would have had me killed. I'm not sorry for what I've done, but I don't wish to be revered as a hero either.
I thank you for your help. I'm sure your conscience weighed heavily upon you as you led Ulrich to his death. You did the right thing.
Though I'm happy that Ulrich has been removed from his post, I'm still saddened that there'll be no true retribution for Aldos.
When I was younger, and living in Vvardenfell, my parents instilled in me the code of an-eye-for-an-eye. It's hard not to see that through.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't berate what you've done for Cheydinhal. Everyone appreciates what you did, as do I.
Although your intentions were good, your actions were despicable. Murder is the lowest form of revenge, and a road I would never dare to tread.
Allow me to check with the Count.
You've done it! This letter will spell his undoing when I present it to Count Indarys. Splendid work, splendid work indeed!
I must hasten to the Count and deliver this immediately. Please, meet me back at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn in about two hours.
I don't see anything here we could use to incriminate Ulrich. You must return with something more tangible. Be careful.
I'm very disappointed in you. The proper way to do this would have been my way, but you chose bloodshed. I should have you arrested.
However, since you aren't fully at fault, I won't report your involvement to the Count. Llevana, on the other hand, will pay for her crime.
I'll ensure that her stay in jail is not long. Obviously, I had no love for Ulrich, so I'll do what I can on her behalf.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must speak to the Count. Please, meet me at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn in two hours.
Llevana has always been quick tempered. You must reconsider her plan. It can only lead to prison for her... and for you.
I swear that Ulrich will pay for this. We must handle this carefully and prove to the Count that he needs to be arrested.
Ulrich has been watching me, so I haven't been able to enact the plan I devised to bring him down. That ends today now that you're here.
The evidence we need to incriminate Ulrich must lie within his quarters. You must sneak in there and retrieve it without being seen.
If you're caught, there isn't anything I can do to help you. Just be careful.
Beware of Ulrich. I wouldn't confront him at this time, as he'll surely have you thrown in jail.
If you raise a hand against him and strike him down, you'll be accused of murder. Even if Ulrich doesn't do things by the letter of the law, I do.
It appears you've spoken to Llevana. I know she sounds a bit like a raving madwoman, but she isn't far from the truth.
Ulrich is definitely up to something. Every day, we take in exorbitant fines from the people. Where most of that money goes, I have a good idea.
Ulrich keeps his quarters locked, but I've glimpsed inside. The things he has in there could never be purchased on a Captain's salary.
At first I thought maybe he was from wealthy stock, but many of the goods have been delivered recently.
I'd love to bring him to task in front of Count Indarys, but I dare not without a solid witness that will speak against him.
I can't say I'm prepared to speak to you about that. No telling who will end up finding out.
Ulrich will be spending years in the city dungeons. This should give him plenty of time to reflect on what he's done.
I'll make the necessary arrangements for his burial. He'll be buried next to his poor wife.
Oh no! They killed him? I can't believe this! Ever since his wife passed at the hands of the bandits, his life has been miserable.
I'd grown to become fond of him. I wanted to take him into my house, but I was afraid. And now look what's become of him.
There are no more options left. Ulrich must be dealt with, and actions speak louder than words. You must do something for me.
Go tell Ulrich that I have some information that incriminates him. Tell him to come alone, or he won't get it.
Then, lead him here, and I'll do the rest.
Oh my! You better find him and see what he's doing! Hurry!
Poor fellow. You may be able to find him roaming the streets of Cheydinhal, probably drunk. Only a month ago, he lost his wife.
They were traveling the road from the Imperial City when a bandit raiding party struck. He barely escaped alive.
Ever since then, he's been drunk. Sure, he gets rowdy sometimes, but he's never hurt anyone.
You saw what happened, I had no choice. Aldos attacked first, and I had to defend myself.
If you don't like it, take it up with Ulrich.
Aldos will be mourned. I won't sit by and watch the innocent being driven to the brink like that. Something must be done, but without bloodshed.
Damn. I was afraid this might happen. Poor Dunmer. Please, go tell Llevana the sad news. I must ponder the situation.
Make haste! Find him quickly... no telling what mischief he may get himself into and we need him as a witness!
Aldos is living on the street now that his house has been seized. I begged Ulrich to give him more time, but he wouldn't.
He won't be hard to find, just follow the smell of stale mead.
I'm not going to stand here and debate this all night. You give me that evidence, and I'll consider not having you executed.
Aldos was a drunkard and a fool. He decided to draw a blade and attack a guard, so he paid the price.
Of course I know what's going on. What intrigues me is that you had the nerve to threaten me. I'm just curious to see what you've come up with.
So, Llevana, I hear you have something I'd want to see?
As you wish, Ulrich. Come my lovelies! Your feast has arrived!
You bastard! How many more people are going to "pay the price"? How many more have to die just so you can earn another gold coin?
Just because you run the law in this town doesn't put you above it. You're going to pay for what happened to Aldos.
Ulrich, how dare you walk in here like you don't know what's going on.
So, you say Llevana wishes to see me? Very well, lead on. This should prove amusing.
Here comes another one!
Stay sharp!
I've got that one!
For Uriel Septim!
This one's mine!
Get my back!
Stick together!
The only way out of the Savage Garden.
Only those wearing the Bands of the Chosen may enter the Forbidden Grotto. But they never return, so we don't know what fate awaits them.
The one path from the Savage Garden is through the Forbidden Grotto.
Only those few wearing the Bands of the Chosen are allowed to leave the Garden.
The Forbidden Grotto is the only way out of the Savage Garden.
Those who earn the Master's favor are given the Bands of the Chosen and allowed to leave the Garden.
Only those wearing the Bands can enter the Forbidden Grotto. No one who enters the Grotto ever returns.
At Mankar Camoran's command, a favored few are given the Bands of the Chosen and may leave the Savage Garden.
You cannot pass through the door to the Forbidden Grotto unless you wear the Bands.
Those bracers you're wearing ... that's what we put on the prisoners here. It prevents them from escaping, and makes them easy to control.
I can get them off you, but I'll need some time.
Those favored by the Master to wear the Bands may enter the Forbidden Grotto, and leave this Savage Garden forever.
He's trapped at the back of the cave. It took us weeks to prepare the trap, and he killed us many times before we finally succeeded.
The lesser creatures of the Eternal Garden still torment us, but Anaxes was the worst. He toyed with us, prolonging our deaths for his pleasure.
You must not release him, for pity's sake!
Mankar Camoran's chattels trapped the Xivilai Anaxes in a cave. He is their Lord, and thus they mock him and me.
Free Anaxes and restore order to the Garden, and you shall have the Bands of the Chosen.
Our clan sacked your city of Kvatch... a trifling task fit for scamps.
Your swift retribution earned you much respect among my people. We had not expected that a mortal would act with such resolution and honor.
It is no dishonor for us to speak.
Wrong! I'm the one in blue! Maenlorn is the one in brown.
Right! The one in blue! You remembered.
You are stupid if you come to chatter. If you want to train, and you pay me, then that is not so stupid.
Between the sailors and shipmen of the port, and my little local circle of friends, I have plenty of yarns for knitting up my tales.
We are from Anvil.
Many of Anvil's folk are directly or indirectly associated with ships and sailing...
... sailors, ship-owners, men made rich and poor by the sea trade, and the lonely wives of men who follow the sea.
Anvil's a port town. That's why you'll see items here you won't find in the Imperial City. The captains keep an eye out for special items for me.
Carahil inherited the Anvil Mages Guild chapter from Hannibal Traven, the Archmage. She runs a clean hall, just like Traven did.
Watch yourself around the Fo'c's'le. Sailors despise landsmen, and won't hesitate to treat them to a good beating when they're in their cups.
I've gone aground in ports all over the Abecean Sea, and Anvil's far from the worst. Got the Fo'c's'le for my hammock, and Mirabelle to keep it warm.
Been here thirty years, and I expect I'll last another ten or so. When I'm gone, gods willing, my apprentice, Enilroth, will tend the smithy.
I'm from Morrowind, north coast of Vvardenfell, near Khuul, so I like it here on the Gold Coast. Sometimes I miss home, but not too much.
If you're looking for hard-to-find ingredients, try Lelles' Quality Merchandise, outside the walls facing the harbor.
You can't imagine the fuss some people make. My rats are no problem for anyone.
The Anvil Mages Guild is proud to follow the example Hannibal Traven sets for us: mastery and scholarship free of the dark arts.
We'll be ready if the daedra decide to attack, don't worry.
They say that I was selected as Dibella's Primate in large part because of my loving nature and my striking looks.
You can best know Anvil by walking its streets and speaking with its people. My favorite time is the harbor at sunset, the sun and sea to the west.
Pretty, isn't it? And quiet. Not much work for us.
You're not from around here, are you? Just a warning... be careful if you go swimming. It's the slaughterfish. They'll swarm you.
Plenty of deer, wolf, boar, mountain lion, bear in the county. Just need to know where to look for 'em.
Well, if you don't mind scruffy sailors smelling like bilge, it's a lovely town. The men are all the same, drunk and shiftless.
My husband is down south in Anvil County, working the Valenwood line, hunting down bandits and smugglers.
I am currently employed at the Count's Arms, but I'm working on a piece I hope will gain me the patronage of a certain countess.
Take some advice? Go down to the sea, stand a while. Watch the sun rise and set. Think on the distant lands across the water.
Ships sail from Anvil harbor for ports-of-call in Hammerfell, Summerset Isle, Yokuda, and the Western Isles.
Nice, friendly folk in Anvil, even the Countess greets me in the street. Well, except for that Newheim the Portly. He's a mean old scroat.
Are you kidding? I came here to get away from the mountains and snow. You ever spent a winter in Skyrim? Or Bruma? Give me the Gold Coast any day.
You notice all the Nords around here? It's partly because Nords like ships and sailing. Mostly, we're sick of freezing our asses off in Skyrim.
Anvil wouldn't be my choice for a refit. No proper yard, neither spars nor scantlings in good supply. But, it's ill-luck to complain.
Traffic through Anvil harbor comes mostly in exotic, high-profit goods easy to transport by road or Mages Guild couriers to eastern markets.
You see a sailor in the streets of Anvil, best step out of his way. If it's in his mind to raise hell, a little jail time is just fair payment.
I've got a few hot prospects. I'm sure something will come through for me. Soon. Really soon.
Buildings here look different. Why? This is the Gold Coast style, like in Hammerfell. Eastern towns look grey and dull to me.
Dibella has shed her special blessings on Anvil. We greet travelers with hospitality, and the needy with an open hand.
Our Fighters Guild chapter here is big, primarily because we're a training center, which earns us each a good living.
I worry sometimes I'll go soft here, training mostly, and living easy. So now and then I go out along the coast on my own, just to stay in shape.
Why don't you just walk around and look for yourself? You need someone to explain everything to you?
Sorry. I'm new in town. Don't know a soul.
I like it here. People are very friendly. Much nicer than in the Imperial City.
While you're in Anvil, we'll treat your horse like an honored guest.
I used to be a knacker. That's how I fancy my horses. Ripe, stiff and silent. Hate it when they stare at me. Dumb beasts.
The Count went missing about ten years ago. No one knows what happened to him. Lady Millona rules County Anvil.
Her Ladyship has no intention of remarrying. Liked her first Count well-enough, I guess, and doesn't fancy a replacement.
The Count went missing about ten years ago... but just recently he reappeared. It's a bit of a mystery, but the Countess seems pleased.
Best shops in Anvil? Norbert Lelles handles rare books, exotic ingredients, and gems, and they have fine weapons at Morvayn's Peacemakers.
Varel Morvay's been a good master. I like the town and the people. No reason why I wouldn't want to be here for many years... just like the master.
Restless folks like you don't much like town life. Too slow and easy. For you, the life of the rover... gold and glory, blood and treasure.
The Countess deserves all the credit. I do things my way, indeed, but she gives me the authority and support.
Our gracious Countess funds my research. I ward tame rats with resistance spells, then shower them with elemental attacks.
Get outside of town, if you get a chance, and hike north along the coast. Great views and good hunting.
I believe some people think of Anvil as a slow, sleepy place compared to eastern Cyrodiil, but there's plenty of trouble up north to be found.
It's a big town. Hell, it's a big county. You stick to your part, I stick to mine, all right?
Mother's coming for me in the dragon ships. I don't like these itchy clothes, but I have to wear them or it frightens the fish.
The life of a sailor's wife isn't an easy one. Heinrich is at sea nine months out of ten. But Anvil's a friendly town, and the Nine console me.
Soldiers of Cyrodiil! The Empire will stand or fall by what we do here today!
Will we let the daedra do to Bruma what they did to Kvatch? Will we let them burn our homes? We will let them kill our families?
No! We make our stand here, today, for the whole of Cyrodiil!
We must hold fast until the Hero of Kvatch can destroy their Great Gate. We must kill whatever comes out of that gate!
Soldiers of Cyrodiil! Do you stand with me?
For Anvil!
For Chorrol!
For Cheydinhal!
Leyawiin!
Skingrad!
For Bruma!
I understand. Well, if it's all the same to you, please don't tell anyone about Gogan's indiscretion.
If you change your mind, please let me know.
Thank you. I'm afraid I can't offer you much help, but I'll do what I can.
An all-female gang of thieves has been recently plaguing Anvil with a very unique method of robbing. They pick on only the men.
If you want to help us do something about it, go talk to Gogan and Maelona. Let's just say Gogan is intimately involved and leave it at that.
Sorry we had to fool you like that, but it was the only way to get someone in close enough to stop Faustina's gang.
I would have done it myself, but well, ok... I fell for their trick. Thought I'd get lucky, turns out that they don't do anything. They just rob you.
Let's keep that between us please... shhhhh.
I see my wife couldn't keep her big mouth shut.
Yes, it's true. I lost the family ring to those sirens. I'm ashamed about the whole incident, but not ashamed enough to ask for your help.
I was sitting in The Flowing Bowl, when the most fetching Nord woman you've ever seen walked in with an equally attractive Imperial woman following.
After we exchanged words, I followed them out to a farmhouse. Inside, they asked me to remove my clothes and items.
Well... I did... and then suddenly they brandished weapons and robbed me. They sent me away with barely a stitch of clothing! Harlots!
Just please, help me get that ring back. I want to save what's left of my marriage.
Talk to Maelona. She runs the council. Judge, jury and executioner.
Gogan and I are really members of the Anvil City Watch. I suppose you could say we work undercover.
We've been trying to foil Faustina's gang for months now. Every time we tried to interview a man who was lured there, they refused to talk.
The women in the gang picked married men to seduce for just that reason. It was decided the only way to stop this gang was to send in a stranger.
You fit the bill perfectly. It's a shame it had to end in so much violence, but someone was bound to get hurt sooner or later.
All I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront.
Gogan may be able to give you more information beyond that.
When Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking.
He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day.
The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold.
Can you help us?
Everyone's making fun of me because I fell for the siren's charms. Well, now I have the last laugh!
I can't believe you just went ahead and killed that gang member. Gogan and I were actually working undercover for the Anvil City Guard.
Your actions have set back our investigation, and maybe driven the rest of the gang into hiding. Nice work.
It appears that you got all of them. We never found evidence of any other members. Nice work!
Yes, I've noticed some of them in my establishment. They don't break the law while they're here so there's nothing I can do.
If you wait around long enough, I'm sure they'll show up.
The women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now.
The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it.
Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.
Fine, then best be on your way.
Oh, you heard about that? We were trying to keep it quiet, but people in this city are far too nosy. Very well, since you said you want to help.
I don't suppose you've heard all of the details about the gang of harlots running their little charade here in Anvil have you?
Well, that's never happened before. I suppose we'd have to kill you. I mean, we can't have you going back to Anvil and ruining the whole plan.
But why say no, when it's so much easier, and more lucrative, to say yes? Or are you here for something else?
We'll clean up the mess. Don't concern yourself about it. I'm sure you had no choice.
If you ever find yourself back in Anvil, stop by anytime and say hello. Oh, and please say nothing to anyone about our true identities.
You've done well, and here is the reward that I promised.
Damn, I knew it! You're working for the city guard aren't you? I didn't think they would be stupid enough to send someone alone, but so be it.
I should have known after I fenced that stupid ring and discovered it was a fake. Worthless! All part of the guards' plan I suppose.
Ok, girls! We got someone who doesn't want to cooperate!
What? What are you talking about? Don't you want to have fun? Come on, don't be shy. Or are you here for something else?
Hope you're not planning to get much sleep.
Do I really have to spell it out for you? You're a man, and I'm a woman with a certain desire. You figure out the rest.
Just to be perfectly clear, we're not prostitutes. We do everything on our own terms, and the men never, ever lay one hand on us.
You can make a good deal of money in our gang. But you have to be willing to show a little skin if you know what I mean.
Martin Septim!
Hail Martin Septim!
Huzzah for the Emperor!
Martin! Martin! Martin!
Into the Skingrad dungeons? Not likely. Not unless you got yourself arrested. Of  course you are a thief. Just break in.
I've bought a few things at Mach-Na's, but he's always so surly.
He runs a nice store, but Mach-Na is a grouchy old man.
Rumor has it he joined the priesthood to avoid military service. What a coward.
I heard he became a priest to avoid becoming a soldier.
I find her annoying. She's way too full of herself. Quite the big talker.
I don't like to talk to her. All she wants to talk about is herself.
I hope she takes care of herself as well as she takes care of others.
She's very dedicated. We would be lucky to have more people like her around.
I've heard that she's always wanted to compete, but her parents are against it.
He's quite an accomplished brawler. I wonder if he'd teach me something about it.
He's good with his fists, no doubt about it. He'll teach you something, for the right price.
Deetsan loves to talk about his guild. It's good that he's proud of his work.
He's always wanted to be in the guild. Good that he was finally made a member.
They're obviously very fond of one another.
It's clear that they're in love. Good for them.
I can't imagine why someone would act the way he does.
He's an ass. There's no excuse for his behavior.
She loves her dogs. No question about it.
I'm impressed with how she handles dogs. She handles people pretty well, too.
There's something about that place that's just a bit off.
I don't even like to walk by that place.
She certainly does take pride in the Newlands.
She runs a good inn, and she's proud of it.
I'd like to bet, but I don't want to be told that what I'm doing is sinful.
I don't mind betting, but it's not worth having to hear a lecture about it.
He's not the friendliest person around, but he can teach you a lot about running a business.
He knows a lot about running his store. Of course, he's not the easiest person to talk to.
She's pretty shy, unless you get her talking about armor.
Her knowledge of armor is really impressive.
I heard he learned about Alteration because he's too scared to fight. Pathetic.
I've heard he joined the priesthood to avoid serving in the military. What a coward.
Gruiand is a bit high and mighty. She does have a way with words, though.
She's silver-tongued, but I don't want to listen to her.
Everyone is very fond of Ohtesse. And her healing skills are simply excellent.
Ohtesse is the most dedicated person I know. She really needs to take better care of herself, though.
I understand her parents are against her competing. Quite a shame.
There's something about him I don't trust. He's quite a brawler though. I wouldn't want to tangle with him.
I would hate to be on his bad side. He's really good with his fists.
I've heard him talk at length about the Mages Guild. I understand he's been teaching members about Illusion, as well.
He goes on and on about the guild. He's very proud of it. I understand he teaches Illusion there now, as well.
Ganredhel does seem to love her dogs. She taught me a little something about acrobatics, though, which was helpful.
She's a very demanding teacher. You can learn a lot from her, if you're willing to try.
Terrible jokes. Just terrible.
I've heard them. They're pretty stupid.
He pays his debts, but his love of dogs is just odd. I've heard he leaves meat in his backyard to attract them.
He's a bit crazy for dogs, from what I hear. He pays bets on time, though.
I've heard the dogs that J'bari keeps drive her crazy. I've also heard she knows a lot about acrobatics.
Tsrava says the sound of J'bari's dogs drives her to distraction. Can't say I blame her.
I understand they've been taking a lot of the contracts that used to go to the Fighters Guild.
I don't trust them. I've heard they're effective, but they're brutal.
They argue a lot, but that's just their way. I don't think they're ever really angry with one another.
I've heard them, but I think they just do it for fun. They seem to enjoy it, and it's all in good fun.
I've heard him talk, and talk, and talk. Haven't heard anything useful yet, though.
He goes on and on. I'm not sure he's ever said anything useful, though.
She knows a lot about doing business. I don't like to bother her, though. She's a bit touchy when you do.
She's a smart one. You could learn a lot from her.
He's always trying to stir things up. I don't think he means any real harm, though.
I think he's just playing around. I don't think he means anything by it.
She's ridiculous. I don't know what her problem with Argonians is, but she's always trying to start something.
I don't know what her problem with Argonians is. She's going to cause some real problems, if she's not careful.
Touched by the gods. He hears things. Who knows? He's happy... let him be.
Don't mind him. He's not right in the head. Poor fellow.
Must have been knocked on the head. Talks all sorts of rot. Meek as a sheep, though.
Crazy as a rat in a catbox. Just leave him alone. He's not hurting anybody.
It's been a hobby of mine for years. I've collected cheeses from all over Tamriel, including the rare Olroy cheese!
A more pungent cheese you'll never find. It looks smooth, but it stinks to the heavens and beyond!
I keep it locked away tight. If I were to try cooking with it, the smell alone would draw rats for miles! It's a lovely conversation piece, though.
I fear it won't survive this day! The K'Sharra has come!
I'm glad you asked. I could go on all day about our little community. We are but a handful of Khajiit, as you can see.
Many are the evenings we spend around the cooking fire, sharing stories of Elsweyr. The smell of our food travels for miles!
If you'd like to stay, I'd suggest getting a room at the Border Watch Inn. We don't get many visitors, but S'thasa serves a fine ale.
She also has the finest collection of cheeses in the Empire! Her prized cheese has such a powerful aroma, she keeps it sealed in a case!
Find me in a few hours. We'll kill the Gatekeeper.
It's just down the road from Passwall. It's where Relmyna created the Gatekeeper.
It is where the body of my child was grown, and the resting place of his less fortunate siblings. You have no business going there.
They say the Gatekeeper's magical. I don't believe in magic. But I do believe in bones.
And the best way to kill something is with the bones of its own.
I can see the bones of a dead Gatekeeper in the courtyard of the Gardens. The door's locked, though.
You'll pick that lock, and I'll collect the bones. Then I'll make some arrows, and we'll kill the Gatekeeper. Sound good?
You ready to go?
Mankar Camoran's chattels, the unmortals that swarm here in the Savage Garden, their proper role is to test themselves in unceasing combat.
But, being no true immortals, they are without honor or courage, and shy from battle.
However, by some trick, they trapped one of my agents, the Xivilai Anaxes, in a cave.
They show initiative, and Anaxes doubtless deserves humiliation, but I cannot permit this to continue.
Do me the service of freeing Anaxes, and I will reward you with the Bands of the Chosen and passage to the Forbidden Grotto.
You are unlike any other mortal I have encountered. You serve me, and then you spurn the reward for your service.
Come. As an equal, I shall grace your name and corpse with honor.
Your mind follows the simple path ... the choice of an animal. You see an enemy and you attack it, unthinking.
But you have courage, at least. To slay a bold animal like you is not without glory.
Take these Bands of the Chosen, then. Wear them, or you cannot enter the Forbidden Grotto, the only way out of the Eternal Garden.
Honor, and pride, bids me tell you: none can escape the Forbidden Grotto. There you will be the charge of my kynsman, Orthe.
I am tasked with keeping order here in the Savage Garden where Mankar Camoran's chattel challenge themselves in unceasing combat.
By freeing the Xivilai Anaxes, you restored the order to the Garden that the unmortals had upset by imprisoning him.
Like all mortals, you talk when you should listen. You will have your chance for battle, if you wish it.
An intriguing choice. And I have a task in mind that will test your wit, and your loyalty.
The rabble of the Savage Garden have imprisoned the Xivilai Anaxes. I consider his humiliation a fitting punishment.
However, his shame attaches to me, and though the matter is too small for my attention, it is not too small for one of my servants.
Free Xivilai Anaxes, and I shall reward you with the key to the Forbidden Grotto... the Bands of the Chosen.
Your mind follows the simple path, the choice of an animal. But you have courage, at least.
You will fail, mortal, and then where will you be? Dead. And nothing.
You are impertinent, mortal. I did not offer to answer questions.
There is one way out of the Garden. I guard that path. You will travel that path, and it will bring me honor to defeat you.
But you shamed my kin at Ganonah. To bring you into my service... that would also bring me honor.
So I offer you a choice. Would you confront me in battle? Or offer me service?
I find myself in your debt and this irks me. I am honor bound to repay my debt to you. If you will it.
There is one path from the Savage Garden. I guard that path. In return for your service, I offer you the key to that path.
If you refuse a gift from an enemy, you may choose instead to prove your honor upon me in combat.
By giving you this choice -- gift or battle -- I discharge my debt to you.
You speak directly like one of my people almost. I'm glad I did not kill you immediately.
Talk or not as you choose. But you will listen.
More than 50 years ago, my wife Rona and I were both turned into vampires. While I came to embrace the changes in myself, she did not.
She hated what she had become, and refused to feed to keep herself healthy. She eventually slipped into a coma from which she has not awoken.
My trusted servants have cared for her all this time, but I wish for her to at last find peace. The cure is for her.
I have researched what I can, but acquiring the cure is beyond my grasp. I cannot risk drawing too much attention to myself.
So I would ask that you take up the search on my behalf. If you are successful, I will reward you in whatever small way I can. Will you aid me?
I wish to tell you a story, so that you might understand why I would trust you with my secrets. Would you hear it?
I see... Please, wait here one moment. I shall speak with the Count.
Then please excuse me.
I'm afraid the Count does not see anyone without an approved appointment. Do you have an appointment?
A cure? You mean, besides death?
Such a thing is beyond our control. The body is so warped by vampirism, few would be able to revert its effects. Even fewer would care to try.
The guild of Mages might know more. Speak with Raminus Polus; he may be able to guide you.
A cure? Yes... Yes, I believe it's possible. A mage named Raminus Polus has done some research. He's in the Imperial City, at the Arcane University.
You already have the cure. Shouldn't you be delivering that somewhere?
The cure you seek is ready!
I'm quite pleased with the results. The batch came out larger than I'd expected; there is enough for two doses of the potion.
Unless I'm mistaken, I believe this dose is promised to someone. Should you ever have need of another, for... personal reasons, I can provide it.
Our work here is done. You should be on your way.
I have everything I need. Now all that remains is to brew the potion. This, however, is a task with which you cannot assist.
Give me twenty-four hours. I shall have the potion ready for you then.
Once I have all the ingredients I need, I'll fashion a cure for you. This is a delicate matter, and cannot be rushed.
Bring me the Soul Gems I've asked for, and then we'll discuss a cure.
Oh my!
What makes you think I would know about such a thing?
I have told you what I require from you. There is no more to say now; speak with Hal-Liurz when you have found this woman. Excuse me.
I suggest you petition to see Count Hassildor in Skingrad. He will be interested in your condition.
I am pleased that you would ask. There is a way, though it is not known to me.
Count Hassildor of Skingrad has done the most recent research on a cure, I believe. He has what you might call a vested interest in the subject.
I suggest you travel there, and seek an audience with him. Given your condition, I believe he may assist you.
Prisoner! Get in the cage!
Prisoner! Into the cage, now!
There's no way for me to cross. But the Master's immortality does have its uses. I will distract the dremora for as long as I can.
I'll meet you further along in the caves and remove the Bands when you get there. May Akatosh favor you!
Show me some respect, worm! Unless you want to end up in the cages with them.
This is not one of Mankar Camoran's chattels from the Garden. Who is he?
This is not one of Mankar Camoran's chattels from the Garden. Who is she?
Well ... carry on.
A prisoner, sent in by ...
... Yes, kynreeve. Sir. This prisoner was sent in by Kathutet for questioning. I was about to begin.
Nothing escapes your vigilance, kynreeve. Kathutet wondered as well. This is why he sent him for questioning.
Nothing escapes your vigilance, kynreeve. Kathutet wondered as well. This is why he sent her for questioning.
Of course, kynreeve.
I have stories of old, implying they could cure someone of vampirism. I know nothing more than that. I hope you can learn the truth.
Unless directly crossed, I do not believe so. They have been known to help those in need in times past.
The covens are hidden to outsiders. The last I heard rumors of was a coven seen somewhere in Morrowind, years ago.
It is my hope that this woman you seek will know more.
If you are successful, perhaps you shall. For now, that is not necessary. I have no wish to endanger her.
I do not know. In her weakened state, it may well end her life. Even that would be a relief for her, after these many years of torture.
She is safe, hidden within the castle. That is all you need know for now.
I know very little about them. They operate outside the bounds of normal society.
I will tell you what I can. What would you know of her?
No? I thought you might be interested yourself, given your condition. Should you change your mind, simply speak with my steward.
I shall do what I can in the meantime. Please, excuse me. I have other matters to attend to.
No? Perhaps I was mistaken about you. You know my plight; should you change your mind, speak with my steward.
I shall do what I can in the meantime. Please, excuse me. I have matters to attend to.
What little I have discovered points to the witches of Glenmoril. In the past, they have been capable of creating a cure.
I have searched for these witches throughout Cyrodiil, but no covens still exist within its borders.
There may be one left. I have unconfirmed reports of a woman seen near the Corbolo river who fits the description of these witches.
Seek her out, and learn whether she can help. She lives somewhere along the river, east of the Imperial City and south of Cheydinhal.
If you are successful in finding a cure, report to my steward. You have my thanks.
My dear, you shouldn't trust rumors. They can get you into horrible trouble.
This time, however, you've heard correctly. I might know a thing or two about it.
But I'm afraid the information isn't free. You do me a small favor, and then we'll talk about this cure you seek.
Oh, my dear! I gave up witchcraft a long, long time ago.
But a cure for vampirism... That's something I haven't thought about in quite some time. Very challenging, and potentially dangerous.
If you do a little something for me, I'll help you. How does that sound?
Good. Follow me, and don't worry. You can trust me.
I understand. Why would you trust me? But you have no choice. I am the only one who can help you escape this place.
No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave the Grotto. You'll discover that for yourself soon enough.
No one wearing the Bands of the Chosen can leave this Grotto. The doors will not open, and there is no other way out.
Here, let me remove them for you ... there. You are no longer a prisoner of the Forbidden Grotto.
I can remove them, but I will need time. Follow me. There's a spot in the next Grotto where we won't be disturbed.
I can remove them, but I will need time. The Dremora overseer will be here any minute to check up on me. You need to play along until he leaves.
Just act like a prisoner, and do as I say. Once Orthe leaves, we can find a quiet spot to remove those Bands.
I was at the sack of Kvatch. They had no chance. We took them by surprise, and we carried the walls in the first assault.
But they fought on anyway. Desperately. They seemed to think this decadent, mundane world of theirs was worth defending.
I was slain after the battle was over. Three townsfolk hiding in a cellar attacked me when I entered their house, hunting down survivors.
They tore me to pieces, although I have no doubt they were immediately killed by my companions.
I've had plenty of time to ponder my deeds since I came here. Ponder, and regret. An eternity of regret.
For my weakness, the Master sent me here, to torture my former comrades who showed similar ingratitude for his gift of eternal life.
I was one of Mankar Camoran's chief lieutenants. I helped plan the Emperor's assassination. I opened the Great Gate at Kvatch.
We were the Chosen. We saw more clearly than ordinary mortals. We would destroy the world and remake it.
Mankar Camoran was our leader, our teacher, our Master. He had the secret knowledge. He dealt with Mehrunes Dagon as an equal.
I bear responsibility for much of the evil that was done in Mankar Camoran's name. I would undo it if I could.
I never thought I would have a chance to redeem myself, waiting helplessly here in eternity.
But now you are here. Perhaps you can kill Mankar Camoran. Save Tamriel from Dagon's final victory.
I can help you. You need my help if you are ever to leave the Forbidden Grotto.
Perhaps Akatosh heard my prayers. Even here. Even after everything I've done ...
I have no patience for impertinence. Maybe I should reconsider what I was about to offer you.
Further use of Savilla's Stone has revealed that I need another special item to move forward with my plans.
I need the boots of Springheel Jak. He is a famous thief that died some 300 years ago. Legend has it that he was buried with his boots on.
Find out where Springheel Jak is buried and bring me back those boots. Will you do this for me? It pays well.
Whelp of a Shadowfoot! You had better learn respect if you want to advance in the Thieves Guild.
Curb your tongue, Shadowfoot! I am the Gray Fox. If you ever want to become a Master Thief in the guild, you had better learn respect.
My work with Savilla's Stone has revealed that I need something special for my plans.
It's a small item in the possession of a powerful court wizard. Will you do this for me? I will pay you well.
I have need of your special gifts. There is an item, hidden away in a remote monastery. I need you to go get it for me.
The monastery is extensive and well guarded, so you should make sure to be well prepared. Should you succeed, I will pay you well for your services.
The Gray Fox has led our guild for over 300 years now. He has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront.
He is a fool of a Captain in the Imperial Watch. He's a real law and order type.
He has a grudge against the Thieves Guild and the Gray Fox in particular. Lex has made it his personal mission to capture him.
The people of the waterfront are very poor. Traditionally the city has not collected taxes from them, even though by law they could.
The money the city would collect would barely cover the cost of collecting.
The Gray Fox has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront. He doesn't want to let this injustice stand. It's a matter of principle.
Oh no. You don't want to do that. Don't believe their lies. They are no true friends. Don't you see it? How they whisper behind your back?
No, light the Torch for Dementia and you'll see how we treat our friends. Dementia takes care of its own.
Few know that the Hero who lights the Torch for Dementia is granted the Ring of Intrigue, a boon for those who would gain access to hidden knowledge.
Surely you will do what is right, won't you?
Yes, let your mind worry at the problem. Let fear and dismay over making the wrong choice sink their talons deep into your brain...
Do not think about it. Dream about it! Let your mind soar on flights of fancy! I know you will choose well, in the end.
You should know, that in addition to the adulation of the people of Bliss, there is also a more... earthly reward.
The Hero who lights the Great Torch for Mania is traditionally awarded the Raiment of Arden-Sul. Not that this should influence your choice at all.
Now, what do you say?
You are truly Demented, as I always suspected. Release yourself to your secret fears and desires. Let them rule you, as they must in the end!
Now, light the Great Torch as a beacon for those who fear and those who inspire fear.
I knew I saw the glint of true Mania in your eyes, my child. Go now and let the holy Flame inspire the people of Bliss to new heights of madness.
The Flame will be lit, by my Lord's command, not yours.
You understand nothing, mortal. I go now to claim the highest honor attainable to my people. Stand aside.
What do you mean? Every Mazken under my command would gladly accept this honor, if it was not my own to claim.
You fought well. I would almost grant you the honor of kindling the Altar, if you were an immortal. Farewell. The waters of Oblivion await me.
The Altars which feed the Flame of Agnon can be kindled only by the willing death of an immortal.
I have hoped for this moment since I took command of the Mazken at Cylarne. I return my soul to the embrace of Oblivion's dark waters. Farewell.
Not at all. It was an honor to carry out such an agreeable duty at the personal command of Lord Sheogorath's personal emissary.
Now it is my even greater honor to die in my Lord's service. Farewell!
My Lord's choice of emissaries is strange. But He tolerates the Mazken in His service as well, so who can fathom His ways?
No matter. I serve him, not you. Stand aside.
The Altars can only be kindled by the willing sacrifice of a Mazken or an Aureal.
It is my great honor to release my soul to Oblivion in service to Lord Sheogorath. Farewell. I will not walk these lands for many a year.
As you wish. I'm sure you'll have no problem finding it on your own.
Very well. I shall mark a fast way to travel there on your map.
Our Lord is always acquainted with Sorceress Verenim's current whereabouts. Her affections have caused Him unnecessary annoyance in the past.
An ancient altar where the Gatekeeper was first created. It is near the Gates of Madness in the Fringe.
I believe Your Grace knows the way?
Ah, you have been asked to choose the pieces with which to construct the new Gatekeeper. Quite an honor.
No choice is without consequence. Each of the pieces is woven with magic, and will become a part of the new Gatekeeper.
This decision is yours. I'm sure Your Grace possesses the wisdom to choose the pieces that will allow the Gatekeeper to best defend the Realm.
The Gardens of Flesh and Bone are where Sorceress Verenim lived and worked for many years.
It is there she experimented with her "sixth element," in order to create the original Gatekeeper.
The Gardens are in the Fringe, near Passwall. Beware, Your Grace. Creatures of the sorceress' doing and undoing haunt those tunnels.
I believe you have completed the tasks in the Gardens of Flesh and Bone, have you not?
Typically, when one has finished an errand, it is time to return. Why is this confusing? Are you feeling quite well, Your Grace?
Relmyna prefers to conduct her experiments in privacy. You will have to deal with her guardians to reach her.
Don't worry if you break her toys. I believe she rather enjoys creating them. And, it keeps her from turning her attention elsewhere.
Has Your Grace no interest in exploration and discovery?
She is a powerful sorceress. She believes she has found a "sixth element," the element of Flesh.
She was expelled from the Mages Guild for this belief, and for the... extreme nature of her experiments.
Our Lord took interest and brought her here, so Relmyna might continue her work, free of those provincial notions of decency and morality.
You will find her in her Sanctum, hidden away in the dungeon of Xaselm.
The Gatekeeper stood guard over the Realm, keeping those not blessed by Sheogorath out... until you, Your Grace, slew him.
Sheogorath has asked that you create a new Gatekeeper to stand watch over the Fringe.
You should speak with Relmyna Verenim as quickly as possible. I fear our time runs short.
You have rebuilt the Gatekeeper. Good show! Perhaps Your Grace should proceed on to Lord Sheogorath to give him the news?
Oh, and I see you have gained a new power. Relmyna's gift with summoning Flesh Atronachs has rubbed off on you, it seems.
Perhaps Your Grace is more susceptible to our Lord's Blessings than at first it seemed. Interesting.
Ah, your task is completed. Wonderful. Our Lord Sheogorath may wish to hear of your success. Perhaps you should tell Him yourself.
Go speak with Sheogorath now.
Adventurers are always causing problems. Good thing the Gatekeeper takes care of most of them.
These adventurers are always causing trouble.
Outsiders should stay out of our home.
Strangers. Probably causing trouble.
I heard. Stupid outsiders.
I can't believe it!
What monster managed to kill the Gatekeeper? Amazing!
Shocking! He hasn't been killed in ages.
The Gatekeeper dead. I didn't think it possible.
Incredible. I can't believe he's dead.
The Resonator? Maybe it'll keep strangers out of Bliss.
It might keep out unwanted visitors.
I'm glad it's working again.
I'm glad our Duke has regained his Chalice.
Praise Arden-Sul the Chalice has been returned.
What's good for Thadon is good for all of Bliss.
Syl is a paranoid fool.
Another conspiracy in Crucible. Not a surprise.
Syl always thinks someone is out to get her.
I feel better with the Torch burning.
The Torch shines brightly over Bliss.
The Great Torch burning is a good sign for us all.
Syl being killed is no surprise, but Thadon leaving, as well?
Who cares about Crucible? Who will replace Thadon?
Syl is dead, but Thadon is missing! These are dark times.
A shame about Thadon. He lived life to its fullest.
With Thadon dead and Syl gone, there's only one Duke left in the city.
This is bad news for Bliss. The news is not better in Crucible, though.
If these armies are through the Gates, the city could be next!
The Golden Saints will protect us.
Good that it is only the Fringe that has been attacked.
I hear he's a sight to see.
Maybe he can help with these strange Knights.
It does feel safer with a Gatekeeper guarding the Realm.
Bliss is safer with the army's return.
The Saints and Seducers will protect us.
We are all safer now.
He can't leave! Bliss must be protected!
Sheogorath will return. He must return!
How can He leave? It must be a ploy of His.
Hail Sheogorath!
We're saved! Sheogorath has protected us once again.
Jyggalag never stood a chance.
Strangers are bad news.
Outsiders are always up to no good.
I wish these adventurers would stay out.
There are enough people in the Shivering Isles.
New faces in the Isles? That doesn't bode well.
The Gatekeeper dead. That concerns me.
A dead Gatekeeper means more adventurers in the Isles.
Who knows what will get in, now that the Gatekeeper is dead.
I can't believe someone got past him.
That's incredible. I didn't think it possible.
Good. It's always the settlements that adventurers get to first.
I'm glad the Resonator is working. Keeps threats contained.
That's good news.
Good for Thadon. Doesn't help us any.
I'm sure the Duke is very happy.
I'm sure Thadon will celebrate appropriately.
Crucible can be a dangerous place.
There's always intrigue in Crucible.
Syl tends to jump at shadows.
The Torch only matters to those in New Sheoth.
The people of New Sheoth must feel some relief.
That's great for the city, but what about the settlements?
A new ruler in Crucible, and an empty throne in Bliss. Amazing.
Syl's finally dead. I'm not surprised.
It seems there's a lot of turmoil in the Court of Madness.
Seems things are a mess in New Sheoth.
Thadon and Syl gone. Strange times.
We all knew that's how Thadon would go. But, Syl?
This is terrible. Just terrible.
If Passwall has fallen, which of us will be next?
Passwall is only the first, I'm sure. Where are the armies to protect us?
He may help protect us. We can only hope.
That should keep Passwall safer. But what about the rest of us?
Let's hope he's better than the last one.
I'm sure the armies will protect the city, but what about us?
This is good news.
Let's hope the Saints and Seducers can protect us.
Sheogorath has abandoned the Realm. We're doomed.
He can't leave. He still has work to do.
How can He leave now? That's impossible!
Amazing. Sheogorath returned just in time.
Thank Sheogorath we're safe.
Our Lord has protected us once again.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
New people in the Isles usually means trouble.
I'd steer clear of any newcomers.
Adventurers are always causing trouble around here.
I don't know why adventurers feel the need to disturb our home.
I'm amazed the Gatekeeper was killed.
I can't believe the Gatekeeper is dead.
How did someone manage to kill him?
Quite a feat to get past the Gatekeeper.
I'm shocked the Gatekeeper is dead.
With the Gatekeeper dead, it's good to have the Resonator working again.
The Isles are safer now.
That will take care of pesky adventurers.
I've heard the Resonator is a dangerous thing.
That should deter unwanted guests.
A fool and his Chalice. Wonderful.
Thadon is a drug-addled fool.
Why would I care if someone is helping Thadon?
We must all be on watch.
Syl has spies everywhere. We are all at risk.
Syl is always threatened.
The Flame being re-lit is a good sign.
The Torch once again casts its light on Crucible.
Perhaps the Torch is a sign of hope.
Perhaps Syl was right all along.
I hope the new ruler of Crucible is a good one.
Amazing that someone finally got to Syl.
Thadon finally did himself in. Good riddance.
Thadon dead, and Syl gone. This isn't good.
It's no surprise Thadon killed himself. I'm more shocked about Syl.
If the Fringe has been attacked, Crucible could be next.
Thank Sheogorath it was only a settlement, and not Crucible.
I'm sure Sheogorath's armies can handle it.
Maybe the new Gatekeeper will keep the peace out there.
Perhaps this Gatekeeper will be made of sterner stuff.
I can't imagine this new Gatekeeper can protect us, either.
We can all sleep better with the armies at full strength.
Crucible will be safer with the armies intact.
Our Lord's armies will destroy these Knights.
He'll return. He must return.
Our Lord cannot be gone.
Gone? I can't imagine Him leaving us now.
I knew Our Lord would protect us.
Sheogorath victorious. Madness reigns!
We are safe. For now.
I have no time for idle chatter with dilettantes. When I'm finished with the Encyclopedia Sheothia, you may study it to your heart's content.
I can see that the scope of my research is far beyond the limited understanding of a cretin such as yourself.
Let me make it very simple for you. Don't speak to me. Ever.
Now, thanks to your rude interruption, I have to start my day's work all over again.
It was wonderful! Your show was amazing!
Oh, I loved it! Best I've ever seen. You're one of the Realm's greatest artists, if you ask me.
Do you call that juggling? You should be ashamed of yourself.
Shockingly awful, if you really want to know. Worst I've ever seen.
Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni!
Hmm... not bad! Better than my old pair. Thanks, friend!
Sweet and juicy! You're the best!
Sweet and juicy! I can always count on you, my best pal!
Nice and crunchy! Thanks!
Ah! My favorite! You're a good friend, you know that?
Oh no. Oh no no no. No no no no no no no!!
What? What did you say? What did you say?!
How mercenary of you! You and I both know the Museum is the rightful home for such an Oddity. I hope you change your mind eventually.
I'm surprised at your attitude. Here I thought you were a patron of my Museum. I only hope you change your mind one day.
Have it your way. The honor of having one of their items on display in the Museum is enough for most people. But not you, it seems.
Oh, how generous of you! This blind Watcher's Eye is sure to draw a crowd.
Thank you! It is a truly odd Tentacle. I'm so glad to have one back on display.
You really are a dear! A true friend to the Museum. Perhaps Lord Sheogorath himself will come see the exhibit one day.
Fantastic. I can't tell you what it means to me to have this in my collection. You are a good soul.
Thank you, dearie! My museum just wasn't the same without the ashes on display.
How sweet! You truly are a patron of the Odd!
Really? For free? That's so generous of you. I'll put this tomato right back where it belongs in a place of honor!
Such a benefactor! I'll be sure to mention your generosity to all my other patrons.
Oh, you are a sweetie. The museum hasn't been the same since this went missing. It's so nice of you to donate it to the cause of Oddity.
I don't know what to say! You're such a dear! I'm going to put this dagger right back where it belongs.
Oh, my! I'm so glad to have this back. People have been asking me what happened to my Ring of Disrobing, and I just didn't know what to tell them.
Wonderful! I'll put you on my list of Special Donors. It's a very exclusive list, you know.
Well aren't you a darling? I know just where I'm going to put this.
How generous of you! You'd just give it to me? You are a true lover of Oddities, aren't you?
That's a lovely gesture! Thank you so much. Everyone will be so glad to have the Ring back where it belongs.
What a shame. One Sheogorath-shaped amber lump is Odd; two are simply boring. Maybe next time you'll find something really Odd.
This looks just like the one I have... well, had in the Museum. It seems to have been misplaced. I wish I had the funds to buy it off you...
Well, if it doesn't look just like you! So lifelike! My patrons are going to absolutely adore this.
If it isn't the spitting image of Lord Sheogorath himself! So lifelike you can almost see his bad eye twitching! Perfect!
Don't be discouraged! Some people just have better luck than others in finding Oddities.
Well, just keep looking and I'm sure something Odd will turn up!
Oh, don't worry. You'll find something Odd if you keep at it!
Too bad... I already have a deformed Swamp Tentacle. But next time I'm sure you'll find something truly Odd, don't worry.
Interesting... it looks vaguely familiar, like I once had one of these on display. I only wish I had the funds to buy it off you...
Wonderful! Looking at the tentacle, I'm not sure whether to be disgusted or terrified. Just the kind of thing I'm looking for!
Oh... I already have something in the Museum very similar. But don't give up, I'm sure something truly Odd will turn up soon.
I could swear I once had a Blind Watcher's Eye just like that.... I would like to replace it, but the funds just aren't available.
Ah! How deliciously odd! I've never seen a Blind Watcher's Eye before. It will have a place of honor in the Museum.
I'm always looking for new Oddities to add to my collection. Anything unusual, bizarre, strange, or disturbing -- bring it to me!
I do pay a nominal finder's fee, but of course the real reward is your contribution to posterity.
Do you have anything that you'd like to contribute to the Museum?
Have you found a new Oddity that you'd like to contribute to the Museum?
Right then. You lead the way -- just try not to get us killed. Well, try not to get ME killed.
Fine. Just leave me here to die. Not like anyone will miss me.
Let's just hurry this up... please?
What do you think I'm doing? I'm not sticking this close to you because I enjoy your pleasing aroma.
What do you think I'm standing around here for? It isn't because I like being in this place!
Stay here? What's wrong with you? I'll be killed! Take me with you! Please?
The obelisks operate by reflecting and focusing energies in order to create a portal to this Realm.
They can be overloaded and rendered inert by placing the crystalline hearts of the Knights into the obelisk itself.
Each heart will increase the power of the obelisk until it eventually overloads and shuts down, closing the portal.
They'll get more and more active as the Greymarch continues. If they've already taken the Fringe, they must have one there already.
I really hate those things.
Very well, Your Grace. Will there be anything else?
Lord Sheogorath has never succeeded in doing so. They continue to grow in numbers until Jyggalag himself arrives.
Their advance can be slowed. By destroying the obelisks, the Knights lose their conduits into the Isles.
Unlike typical invaders, the Knights do not arrive by conventional means. Instead, they enter the Shivering Isles through conduits into this Realm.
These crystalline obelisks have existed throughout the Realm for all of eternity. You will find they become more active as the Greymarch progresses.
Although they are not composed of flesh as you know it, like any other enemy, they can be destroyed with sword and spell.
Separate the meat from bone, and they will die. When they do so, their crystalline hearts often remain intact.
These hearts are a source of power for the agents of Order. You may find them quite useful in certain situations.
Two halves, two rulers, two places. Meet and greet. Do what they will, so you know what they're about.
The Duke of Mania and the Duchess of Dementia. Seek them out, and let them show you what New Sheoth is. You might be surprised.
Once you understand what My Realm is, you might understand why it's important to keep it intact.
And maybe you'll make some friends along the way. That's always nice!
Ask? ASK? I don't ask. I tell. This is My Realm, remember? My creation, My place, My rules.
Look at you. No concept of what you've stumbled into. No sense of place. You don't even really know where you are, do you?
I suppose few really do, but that's beside the point. We're going to give you a taste of where you have found yourself. You're going to learn.
Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone!
Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese. True?
You've run a maze like a good little rat, but no cheese for you yet. Well, maybe a little.
I've granted you a new spell - the ability to summon Haskill, my Chamberlain, to aid you in your travels. He knows a lot. More than he knows.
In fact, give it a try. Summon our friend to you now. I'll wait.
No luck, huh? Well, I have to get back to my research.
Excellent. I'll just take them.
These are perfect for my research! Thank you. Now go. Shoo!
Liar! You have nothing new here! Begone until you get me something interesting.
Ow! These holes in my shoes are killing me. Well, gotta run!
Work! Never. You're supposed to feel sorry for me and just give it to me. Oh! My legs are itching again. Time to run!
Never mind. I'll find someone else to help me with my research.
No! I've warned you before to keep your brooms out of my house! Just go away. I'll find someone else to help me.
No. You'd just spill on yourself anyway. Well, I have to go sweep my house. It's been over an hour. Goodbye.
I couldn't possibly leave my house. It gets so dirty so quickly. In fact, I have to go wipe down the walls again. It's been over an hour.
She doesn't like it when I run through her plants. All she seems to care about is collecting plants and animals.
Remind me to ask you about my bestiary. In the meantime, what have you found for me?
Do you have any new items from the list?
You're offering to help me with my research? Well... I suppose I could find a use for you, despite your lack of training.
Here's the list of things I need. Get me everything on it. Try to remember where you found it so you can tell me. It's important.
My work is far too important to trust to you.
She is obsessed with collecting plants and animals. I'd steer clear of her. Now, do you mind moving? I need to sweep there.
Really? She wanted help? I could use some help. Actually I could use some food. Do you have any? I'm not picky. Anything at all.
But then who will run around the town? I need to keep retracing the circle or it will break.
Money for wine? I think not. However, I will pay you to collect Hunger tongues. What do you think?
Don't you dare touch anything in my house! You'll ruin my research. Hmmm. Would you be willing to run an errand for me? I'll pay you.
No, no shoes. But how about a bath? You really should take a bath. You shouldn't run any errands for Mirili until you take a bath.
Will you let me clean and organize your house?
My bestiary? Oh, yes. I want to start one. I'd like a Baliwog to begin with. You just get it close to me and I'll take care of subduing it.
I might accidentally kill it. If that happens, just bring me another. Once I have it, I'll make sure it's worth your while.
I have some spells I can sell you if you have no way to command the beasts yourself.
Hmm? I suppose it is about time for me to add another creature. I have hopes for an Elytra. If you see one, could you bring it around for me?
I am getting weary of the same two beasts. All they do is scream when I experiment on them. Do you suppose you could get me a Gnarl?
I'm thinking a Scalon would complete the collection. Unfortunately, you are not powerful enough to handle them yet. Still, if you find one...
Yes, yes, I know. They're all looking quite tiresome. A Scalon would sure spruce things up a bit, don't you think?
These creatures will do for now. However, I'm sure I will eventually get bored with them. Ask me again later.
Thank you for your understanding, My Lord. I am required by Your own command to ask You for any items You may have inadvertently borrowed.
Now, follow me, and we'll find a quiet place away from all this trouble. I trust you will clear up this matter in your own time, in your own way.
My Lord, you do me too much honor! It will be glorious to fall in battle at Your hand!
As you wish, My Lord. I will be honored to test myself in battle against You!
Very good, My Lord. As you know, I must also take any items that might be considered stolen, in order to preserve the peace and justice of the Realm.
Please, follow me, and we'll have this matter cleared up in no time.
I don't think there are any fences in this town.
Bless you! Dar Jee lives east of the temple.
Bless you! Fathis Ules lives in the middle of the Elven Gardens district.
Bless you! There's none in this town, but you could try Bruma.
Bless you! There's none in this town, but you could try Leyawiin.
Bless you! There's none in this town, but you could try Bravil.
Bless you! There's none in this town, but you could try Anvil.
Bless you! There's none in this town, but you could try the Imperial City.
Bless you! Orrin lives in the Castle. Hard to believe, eh?
Bless you! Ongar lives behind the temple.
I just don't know. Is the medicine sustaining Roderick's life, or just postponing his death? How can he survive for so long with a fever so high?
Faith? Are you telling me we're supposed to rely on the good graces of the Divines to keep Roderick alive? Even he would laugh at such nonsense!
I know, Neesha. And I meant no disrespect. It's just that... I hate waiting around like this, watching him suffer!
Then let us trust a bit less to faith, and a bit more to our own strength. I shall guard the medicine cabinet myself. Just in case.
Roderick's fever is in check, unlike your tongue! How can you think such things, after all he has done for us? For you? Have a little faith.
Then what would you propose? What more can we do? That medicine is keeping Roderick alive. For now, that's the best we can hope for.
As do we all, dear friend. Do not fear. I have been assured that the medicine will restore our Roderick to full health. But it will take some time.
And I shall continue my vigil at Roderick's side. It's just a matter of time before our leader returns to us. I can feel it in my heart.
Filthy cur! I told you I was going to get out of here! My time's almost up, and there's nothing you can do about it.
Eleven! Eleven years in this rat-infested hole! But I'm getting out, and you'll still be stuck in here! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'll remember that when I'm lying on the beaches of Sumerset Isle with your wife, you Imperial pig!
You'll see, you Imperial dog! When I get out of here, all of Tamriel will know my name! Valen Dreth! Valen Dreth!
I have to admit, I'm going to miss you, Dreth. The late-night beatings, your pitiful little cries for help...
Yeah, well, what's it been? Seven, eight years? We've had a good long run, you and me. I always knew it would end someday.
Oh yeah? And where will you go? Huh? What will you do? You can't survive out there, Dreth. You're an animal. You belong in that cage.
Right. And you'll be rich, too. Oh, and you'll become a king! You know what I think, Dreth? I think you'll be back. You lot always come back...
All right, all right. I'm tempted to let you out right now if you'll just shut up...
Damn right!
We're with you, Captain!
Yeah!
Alright, boys. Listen up. We've got to close that Gate over there.
Nobody likes the idea of going into that thing, but it's our job, and we're going to do it.
If we don't, Bruma ends up a smoking pile of rubble like what happened at Kvatch.
And that's not going to happen here! Not while I'm Captain of the Guard!
Bor, Soren, you're with me. The rest of you, stay outside and kill anything that comes out of that Gate.
Let's show these bastards how we do things in Bruma!
I've had many a good night in the place.
Olav makes everyone feel welcome.
It's hard to complain. The food is good, and the service is excellent.
Hafid takes care of his customers. It's a bit expensive, though.
She's ridiculous. I suppose some may find it amusing, but not me.
It's awful. I feel terrible for her husband. He must be so ashamed.
I don't know how he does it. It's no wonder he spends so much time at the Tap and Tack, though.
He's a saint. Sure, he spends a bit of time at the Tap and Tack, but you can't blame him.
He's good. We're lucky to have him.
A good healer makes for a happy town. And Cirroc almost seems like another Nord to me!
It seems an odd skill for a priest.
Not your average skill for a priest, but I suppose there are those who will always want to learn.
Right-Wind certainly can handle a blade. No wonder he trains other Fighters Guild members.
He seems gifted with a blade. Can't blame the Fighters Guild for having him train others.
She moves really well in that armor, that's for sure.
She seems skilled in its use. I can see why the Fighters Guild has her training others.
I've heard that J'skar has great skill at making things explode.
Those are dangerous skills for a novice. I hope he trains people well.
I've heard many of Alga's stories. She's got a real gift for telling a tale.
She's the best bard I've ever met. Of course, being a bard is almost as bad as being a pilgrim. There's no future in it.
Can't say I know him well. I understand he'll train people to cast illusions, for a price.
I wouldn't call him a friend. Still, if I wanted to learn more about illusions, he's the one I'd ask.
I've heard a number of stories, none of them good. I understand she might have been a hired assassin.
Apparently, she was wanted in Skyrim for murder. Shot a man dead from over 300 yards. Hard to believe.
He must really know all the fighters by now. And, from what I've heard, he knows a good bit about alchemy as well.
It's a fine place, and Olav treats people well.
I've had many meals there. Olav is an excellent innkeeper.
Hafid has a nice inn. I wonder if he doesn't drink away most of his profits, though.
It's a good place to stay. Hafid is quite a good proprietor.
I don't know why the guards haven't taken care of her yet.
She's a disgrace to our whole city. Poor Olfand.
He's sure got his hands full, between smithing and training in light armor. I don't know how he does it.
He keeps busy. Repairing weapons, training light armor techniques, keeping track of Skjorta....
He's certainly become more like a Nord over the years. Quite a competent healer, too.
It's almost as if he grew up in Skyrim. I don't think the church likes it, but his healing skills are invaluable.
It hardly seems appropriate for a priest of the Nine Divines, but they put up with it.
Seems odd, given his vocation. Still, I suppose there's no harm.
He's talented. The Fighters Guild could do a lot worse.
I can imagine he's a good teacher. The Fighters Guild should be proud of him.
She's quite a warrior. It's amazing how well she moves in heavy armor.
It takes a skilled fighter to move well in armor that heavy.
I suppose that's just the kind of person you want training other mages.
I wouldn't cross him. I've heard he's very skilled.
Much as I dislike bards, I wouldn't mind learning a thing or two from her.
She can spin a yarn, that's for sure.
I've heard he can teach his skills to others, for a price.
I understand he's willing to train others, but it can cost more than a few gold.
I'm not surprised, with the way she handles a bow.
I don't know about her past. All I know is that she's really good with a bow. I wouldn't mind learning a bit from her.
He loves the place. I've also heard he's quite an accomplished alchemist.
It certainly seems to be his passion. I understand he used to be quite an alchemist. I wonder if he'd teach me more about that.
She really is a gifted orator. I wish she'd teach me how to do that.
Uravasa is an excellent speaker. Her sermons are always quite enlightening.
I understand Marz wants to return to Black Marsh. She only stays because she feels needed here.
I've been told that she really wants to return to Argonia, but her services are so useful here, she feels compelled to stay.
I don't have a lot of interest in Conjuration, myself. I suppose if I did, I'd want to talk to Fathis.
It's impressive. I imagine he'd be a good person to talk to about it, if you wanted to learn the skill.
Nahsi is quite a character, and quite an impressive fighter.
I always enjoy speaking with Nahsi. His views on the world are different than most.
I've heard Tadrose Helas does excellent work. Perhaps that's why she's always so busy.
Tadrose is a fine smith, but I understand she only offers services to other Fighters Guild members.
I believe Kud-Ei is in charge of the Mages Guild here in Bravil. She seems very well liked by other members.
I've heard she's quite a talented mage, with an extensive knowledge of illusory spells.
Ardaline makes excellent potions. I imagine she would, since she teaches Alchemy at the Mages Guild.
She's an excellent alchemist. I understand she teaches the trade for Mages Guild members.
Perhaps she grew bored with studying nothing but enchantments and spells. I know I would.
I would assume she's travelled extensively. Must have been some time ago, though, since she never seems to leave the guild hall now.
Her skills with Destruction spells are supposedly impressive. I understand Kud-Ei has her teaching them at the Mages Guild.
I know Kud-Ei will keep her in check. She even has her teaching her spells to other Mages Guild members.
I believe he's always looking for new members, but I don't think it's for me.
Yes. He's a very clever man. Something not quite trustworthy about him, though.
I don't know him well. I've heard he's a nice enough fellow.
I've seen her in the canals a number of times. Other times, I've seen her sneaking around the city.
She's a bit strange, but I've heard she's rather good at not being seen, if you know what I mean.
I hear she's a very private person. I also heard she knows a lot about using light armor.
She tends to keep to herself, that's for sure. That's too bad.
It should be burned to the ground. All those skooma-muddled Khajiit laying around all day... it's disgraceful.
I can't believe nothing has been done yet. The place is a skooma den, pure and simple.
He obviously takes great pride in the lodge.
The Lonely Suitor certainly seems to be a source of great pride for him.
He doesn't seem particularly happy. I think he'd rather spend his time painting.
I've heard that he'd rather be a painter. Still, he runs the place well.
She is very well-spoken. I understand she teaches those skills as well.
She certainly has a talent for speaking. Plus, she's willing to teach others this skill.
Marz is a gifted healer, and teacher. I know that she longs to return to the swamps, though.
Were I injured, I'd seek out Marz.
I've heard he's a talented mage.
I don't have any interest in learning about Conjuration, but I hear he's very good.
He's an interesting man, and an amazing fighter.
I've spoken to him a number of times about inner peace and spiritual harmony. I'm not sure I understood it all.
She's always busy, that's for sure. I have heard she's a good teacher, though.
She probably takes on more than she should. Between smithing and training, she's always hard at work.
I understand that Kud-Ei takes good care of her sisters in the Mages Guild.
I've heard she'll do anything for other guild members, and that she's an excellent trainer.
It seems a bit odd. I don't know how Ardaline feels about it.
I've noticed the same thing. I wonder what's going on there.
Surprising, don't you think, since she never seems to leave that guild hall.
There's no doubt that she knows a lot. Years of studying all sorts of things, I'd expect.
I've heard she's quite skilled in Destruction, and is a favorite of Kud-Ei's.
I'm sure Kud-Ei will keep her in check. I know she has Jend teaching other mages now.
He has a way with words, that's for sure. You could learn a lot from him.
I don't know him too well, but I have heard he's a smooth talker.
I've heard that City-Swimmer has learned the value of not being seen. Quite impressive, and she'll teach it to others.
She's a sly one. I understand she's quite sneaky.
Knowing how to use your armor can save your life. Perhaps I should talk to her.
She's a very private person, but I've heard she has a lot of knowledge to share.

My friends, we have a winner! Behold, the combatant from the Yellow Team! If you bet on the Yellow Team, see the Gatekeeper to collect your winnings!
HOLD!
Of course, Lord, though it may be difficult to prevent your Gatekeeper from intervening. I'm sure the residents of Passwall will be most grateful.
As you wish, My Lord. I will tell the residents you will be handling it personally. I'm sure the survivors will be delighted.
I'm sure that won't be necessary, Lord. Your Gatekeeper can handle it, I'm sure.
As you wish, My Lord. I'll see that a contingent of Golden Saints is sent to the settlement.
As you wish, My Lord. I'll see that a contingent of Dark Seducers is sent to the settlement.
With the help of your armies, the incident has been cleared up. Your loyal subjects have sent this in tribute.
It seems the incident has been taken care of. Your subjects are appreciative, and have sent this as tribute. Well done, My Lord.
Perhaps you'd forgotten about the attacks on Deepwallow, My Lord? I'm sure the citizens might last a bit longer.
There is the current situation at the Gates of Madness, Lord. Near Passwall? Surely, you hadn't forgotten....
Fellmoor can still use your assistance, assuming you can find time in your schedule.
Hale is still under attack. Or had you forgotten? No matter. I'm certain they can hold out a bit longer.
Your attention is still needed at Highcross, though I realize it must be inconvenient for you.
The residents of Split are still in need of your help. At your earliest convenience of course, My Lord.
It seems all is peaceful in the Shivering Isles, My Lord. Will wonders never cease?
Creatures have been reported in Deepwallow, Lord. Perhaps you should intervene... as it is your job.
There are intruders at the Gates of Madness. Perhaps you'd care to intervene? I'm sure the Gatekeeper can handle it otherwise.
Residents of Fellmoor have complained of creatures encroaching on their lands. Perhaps you might be of some help, time permitting.
Your assistance may be needed in Hale, Lord. If you are otherwise occupied, I'm certain the survivors will understand.
I fear the settlement of Highcross is experiencing some difficulties. Perhaps you should intervene?
I'm afraid the settlement of Split has been the victim of recent attacks. Your aid would be appreciated, I'm sure.
RELEASE!
Let's see how much of this you can take before dying, shall we?
Don't worry, if you die I will bring you back to life. We have much left to accomplish.
Does this hurt more or less than last time?
Very interesting.
How does this make you feel?
Please indicate on a scale of one to ten, how much pain you are feeling at this moment.
It appears this level of pain causes you some distress. Interesting.
Each person's pain threshold is different, isn't it?
Thank you for your assistance in my research.
Hmmm.
Hmmm. Is this too much pain?
I hope this is as much fun for you as it is for me.
Tell me, how does this feel?
At this moment, which hurts more, your insides or your outsides?
Ahhh!! No! No! Make it stop, make it stop! Aaayiiee!
<screaming in pain>
Ahhh! Eeeyah! No, no, nooo!
Please! Stop! Ahhieayah!
<sobbing in pain>
Everyone here died in the Master's service. As the Master promised, we are now immortal, like the daedra.
But our life here is a nightmare. The creatures of the Garden torment us endlessly. When they kill us, we are soon reborn and the cycle begins again.
No one has yet found a way to leave the Garden, except those few given the Bands of the Chosen and allowed to enter the Forbidden Grotto.
We have all died in the Master's service. Here in Gaiar Alata we are immortal, and wait to return to Tamriel after Lord Dagon's final victory.
Perhaps you still do not trust me. Very well. I will not interfere. If Akatosh still hears my prayers, go with his blessing.
I am no match for Mankar Camoran, but perhaps together we can find a way to defeat him. Lead on.
The Arcane University is the seat of the Mages Guild in Cyrodiil. Located in the Imperial City, it houses the leaders of our guild.
The Council of Mages meets there in the Imperial City. That's where the real power of the guild lies.
If you do what you need to, you'll get there one day. Just don't forget to help those who have aided you on your way.
Why, all the important people in the guild are there!
Arch-Mage Traven lives there, in the tower. It's a fabulous place - you really should see it some day. I've been there many times myself.
The Imperial City just wouldn't be the same without it. Maybe, some day, if you know the right people, you might get a chance to see it.
It's been the home of the Mages Guild for the longest time. You should see the library they have there!
It's the only place worth visiting in the Imperial City, if you ask me. I only make the trip if I can't find a specific book here.
Without recommendations from the local guildhalls, you'll never see the inside of it. I dare say that's one of the few things Traven has done right.
By all means, travel to the Imperial City and get stopped at the gates. You should get used to that sort of rejection.
Arch-Mage Traven has closed the doors of the University to all who are not qualified to enter. A wise decision, in my opinion.
It's in the Imperial City; perhaps some day you may be able to visit him there. He's done wonderful things for this guild.
The Arcane University is the greatest repository of knowledge in all of Cyrodiil. The privilege of admission is a goal every mage strives for.
Within its walls live those who determine the fate of the guild. It is our stronghold, our sanctuary.
You will come to know it well, in time. I have seen it.
He's probably still out at the cave. Adrienne hasn't let him work here in a long time.
I know, but he usually stops by once a week or so. I don't recall seeing him lately.
I did, in fact. I don't think she was paying attention, though.
That's not surprising. Sometimes I wonder if she forgets to eat, being so focused on that research of hers.
Perhaps I'll steer clear of her, then.
Have you seen the statue? It's in the southwest corner of the town. That's the High Elf explorer, Torval the Pilot.
Back in the Merethic, he charted the sea lanes and explored the River Niben. Torval sailed all the way from Topal Bay up the Niben Valley.
He purchased the Eight Islands... the site of White Gold Tower and the Imperial City... from the beastfolk natives for the secret of literacy.
Pretty soon, the beastfolk all knew how to read and write... which was handy, since it made them better slaves for the Ayleids, hahaha.
Okay. Just being friendly...
Oh. Sorry. The old memory is not what it used to be.
Excuse me. In the Imperial tongue, it means, roughly, 'clan chair' -- the seat of the clan patriarch.
In the Company, we use the term to mean 'leader' -- but it carries the sense of wise father, concerned for the welfare of the whole family.
Beg pardon. It is a word from the Ta'agra, meaning 'warrior for hire'.
In Ta'agra, the word is vaguely disreputable.  Such a fighter fights for gold rather than for clan or Mane.
Of course, the Blackwood Company is mercenary in the Western sense... a reliable, professional contractor for military services.
To get the taste of Khajiit cooking out of their mouths! Hahaha!
A real thigh-slapper, that one, eh? Phew. I heard lots others, only I can't remember them.
Oh. Well. I heard lots of others, only I can't remember them.
Why do Khajiit lick their butts?
Oh. No sense of humor? Your loss.
Good people of Cyrodiil, welcome to the Imperial City Arena! Believe it or not, someone has actually challenged the unbeatable Arena Grand Champion!
But who, you might ask, could possibly be brave enough to face such a fearless foe? Who could wrest the title from our famed Gray Prince?
Good people, I give you the Blue Team's latest Champion, a warrior of skill, strength, and determination!
Behold, the Spellslinger!
Behold, the Butcher!
Behold, Shadowstep!
Behold, the Black Arrow!

Lords and ladies, citizens of the Empire, I give you the battle of the ages! Combatants, steel yourselves! Lower the gates!
Good people, you have just witnessed the impossible! Agronak gro-Malog has been defeated! I say again, the Gray Prince has been defeated!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Spellslinger!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Butcher!

Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Messenger of Death!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Crimson Blade!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, Man o' War!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, Sir Slaughter!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Tamriel Terror!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, Dragonheart!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, Lady Luck!
Behold the new hero of the people of Cyrodiil! Behold, your Arena Grand Champion, the Iron Maiden!
Esteemed Grand Champion, you may leave the Arena now! See the Blademaster to receive your winnings, and be awarded your Raiment of Valor!
Want to learn more? Visit the Waterfront District of the Imperial City. Find the Garden of Dareloth at midnight. Then ask your questions.
Then you want to know about the Gray Fox.
You are most welcome.
What is the color of night?
I'm telling ya, lad, it's bad luck. A woman onboard a pirate vessel! Back in my day, it never would've happened.
Ho, there, laddie, now you're just bein' insultin'! She may be tougher than me, and meaner too, but a better sailor? It ain't even possible.
I told you a million times, that wasn't my fault! The wheel was covered with gull droppings! My hand slipped! Could've happened to anyone!
Bah! You mark my words, boy. That Dark Elf trollop is bad luck. The captain'll end up dead with her around. You'll see.
Oh, come now. How many times has Malvulis saved our necks, huh? Captain Tussaud keeps her on for a reason. She's a better sailor than any one of us.
Oh, right, how could I forget. That time we were almost dashed upon those rocks, near the city of Firsthold. That was somebody else at the helm.
Well, it's never happened to Malvulis, has it? You know why? 'Cause she could sail better than you in her sleep, you old fool!
You'd better watch your tongue, old man! Captain Tussaud hears you talkin' like that, he'll cut it out! Now come on. We been gabbin' long enough.
Chancellor Ocato! Chancellor Ocato!
Not yet. Until we light the Dragonfires, the Gates are open, and Mehrunes Dagon's invasion continues.
While you were gone, I sent a messenger to Chancellor Ocato. He waits for us in the Imperial City.
[Knock knock knock!] Captain! Captain Tussaud! Are you all right sir? We... We heard a clamor. Captain? We're coming in!
I've never used his services, but I hear he's a good teacher.
I'd rather have someone else just repair it. I'd hate to have to take time to repair my armor when I'm doing something else.
She's certainly good. I'm glad she's willing to teach others.
She's the best in the city. And, she'll teach others. It'll cost you, though.
He's as good as you'll find in the city when it comes to heavy armor.
If you want to learn about heavy armor, Varnado is the one to talk to.
The King and Queen is a nice place. The Marillins treat everyone well.
They say they treat all their patrons like royalty. From what I've seen, it's the truth.
If you need to learn how to use light armor, gro-Shug is the one to talk to.
He can teach you a lot about using light armor.
She's something else. I've heard she'll train others, as well.
She's impressive, and she'll train others.
He still teaches, though he lost his passion for it after the Levitation Act was passed. Can't say I blame him.
He's getting up in years, but he's still a good Alteration teacher.
She's nuts. Her hobby is falling from high places.
If you want to learn to fall off a building, she's the one to talk to.
He's a sneaky one. I understand he'll teach others to be sneaky, too.
If you can find him, he can teach you a lot.
I've heard he's good with a lockpick.
Rumor has it that he'll teach others to pick locks.
It's the finest place in the city. Simply an excellent inn.
If you're looking for luxury, there's no better place to stay.
Apparently, he can teach you the basics of lockpicking.
If you're just learning how to pick a lock, he's a good man to talk to.
I've heard there's no one in the city better at opening locks.
He can teach you how to steal the boot right off a lich.
Can't say I've spent much time there. I hear it's nice, though.
It's the best place in the city for alchemical ingredients.
It's the only place to go for books.
Phintias has a good selection, and he'll find some rare books as well.
I've never bought one there, but I've heard many mages swear by the place.
I imagine it must be good, since it's been in business so long.
There are some things you shouldn't skimp on. Spells are one of them.
Discount spells. I'd just as soon buy a "slightly used" shield.
I've sold some things there. Thoronir is an odd one.
If you can get used to Thoronir, you can find some good deals there.
If you're looking for a shield, there's no place better than Stonewall.
Stonewall is the best in the city when it comes to shields.
I try not to eat there. At least since the last time.
It's not my favorite place, but if I'm really hungry, it'll do.
One man's trash soon becomes another man's trash, I suppose.
Jensine's isn't bad, especially if you need to make a quick couple of septims.
Cicero, Sergius, and Tertullian run a good shop.
I've shopped there many times. The brothers never fail to please.
I've shopped there a few times. If you're looking for soul gems, that's the place to go.
I haven't spent too much time there. I hear it's the place to go for enchanting supplies, though.
No real question what Urbul is going for there. He's got weapons. Big weapons.
It's an apt name. He's got big maces and big axes. Urbul is a big fan of killing things thoroughly.
I've never shopped there, but I know she carries good alchemy equipment.
I've browsed Claudette's shop, but I haven't spent a lot of time there.
I've heard it's the best light armor in the city.
I haven't spent time there, but if you're looking for light armor, Best Defense is the place to go.
I've read it. Terribly written, sensationalistic tripe, if you ask me.
I read the thing once in a while. Mostly, I use it for kindling. There's no telling whether anything in it is actually true.
I understand that Vinicia takes a lot of complaints, but nothing ever comes of them.
Vinicia may have the worst job in Cyrodiil. She takes complaints all day, and nothing ever comes of them.
I've heard he'll teach his skills, for the right price.
He's certainly a talented smith. I'm glad he'll train others in the skill.
She's the best I know. Luckily, she'll teach you some of her tricks.
I've never met tougher. She did offer to teach me some of her bargaining tricks, though.
He'll train you in how to use heavy armor, if you can pay for his time.
He knows a lot about it. Plus, he'll teach others how to use heavy armor.
The King and Queen is a fine place, and it's much more reasonable than other places in town.
The Marillins say that they treat everyone like royalty at the King and Queen.
I understand he'll teach light armor skills.
He's really skilled at using light armor. Luckily, he's willing to train others to use it, as well.
She jumps like a toad. She'll also teach others how to do it.
She's pretty amazing. Plus, she teaches others how to do it.
He's getting older, but he can still teach a bit about Alteration. He's been teaching it since before the Levitation Act of 421.
He still teaches others, though. Of course, you have to try to avoid all the Old Man Dust.
She likes jumping off things. That's because she's an idiot.
Maybe she could teach me how to fall off things. That's a useful skill! Much better than, say, swinging a sword or casting a fireball.
I heard that he stood in one place for hours, just to teach himself how to be sneakier. Sounds boring, but whatever works for you.
I saw him once. Then I didn't. How about that.
I understand he'll teach others to pick locks. If everyone knew how, we wouldn't have to carry around so many keys.
I'm glad he's willing to teach others. Lockpicking has gotten so much harder recently. It's more interesting, but it's harder.
It's probably the finest inn in all of Cyrodiil.
I can't imagine that there's a finer establishment in the entire city.
He's calmed down a lot. Can still teach you how to pick a lock, though.
It's true that he's settled down. Still, he can teach you the basics of lockpicking.
He's forgotten more about picking locks than most people will ever know.
If he'll train you in picking locks, you're probably already pretty good at it.
Ogier runs a good shop. His ingredient selection is excellent.
If you need ingredients, it's a great place to shop.
It's a shame all the smaller bookstores are gone. I guess they just couldn't compete.
It's a fine place, but I miss the personal attention I got at the smaller bookstores.
If you're looking for a staff, that's the place to go.
Rindir always keeps a fine selection on hand. It's almost as if he knows my skill level perfectly.
I'm not buying a discount spell. That's just a bad idea.
Seems to me, some things are worth paying full price for.
Thoronir isn't too picky, which is nice.
Thoronir is quite a character. He's dirty and underhanded, but he provides a service.
No question about it: Stonewall shields has the best pieces of steel to hide yourself behind.
I suppose if you need a shield, that's the place to go.
You'll always leave stuffed, assuming you can keep it down.
They sure do sell food. Yup. You can buy food there.
She gives good prices for your old equipment.
It's good to know that there's a pawnbroker around.
All three of them are nice folks.
I don't know which is which. Still, it's a good shop they run.
He has a good selection of soul gems and other things.
He supports all of your enchanting needs.
Urbul keeps a lot of axes and maces. He seems to like big weapons.
Lots of big weapons there. Urbul always has some in stock.
Claudette does a good job. Still, she should rename the place.
It's a nice store, at least for alchemists.
It's the finest light armor selection in the city.
If that's what you're looking for, there's no one better to talk to than Maro.
I prefer to just listen to people talk. Some of the conversations they have are truly remarkable.
We could just listen to people talking. It's uncanny how informed people are.
She takes all the complaints, but nothing ever seems to happen.
She must hate her job, people complaining to her all day.
Martin is right. Declaring oneself Emperor is a delicate matter. In this case, however, I do not think there should be any dispute.
The Elder Council has been governing the Empire since the Emperor's murder. They will be overjoyed to have an heir to crown.
They've been unable to solve the Oblivion Crisis. The Empire is falling apart. Only a legitimate Emperor offers any hope.
The Elder Council rules in the Emperor's absence, by ancient tradition.
Chancellor Ocato heads the Elder Council and is the closest thing the Empire has to a leader right now.
But the Blades answer only to the Emperor, of course. We are not an arm of the government.
Don't worry. The Elder Council can govern the Empire perfectly well until a new heir can be found.
Truth be told, most of the Council has returned to the provinces to deal with urgent local matters, but we are in regular communication.
But the Inner Council still holds regular meetings. We have the situation well in hand, I assure you.
We are now the stewards of the Empire. We can hold the Empire together in the short term.
But to be honest, I don't know what will happen. The provinces have been restive for years, even before the latest crisis.
With no legitimate claimant for the Dragon Throne... troubled times lie ahead.
The Elder Council Chambers are closed to the public for the duration of the emergency.
Chancellor Ocato is the head of the Elder Council. The Council rules in the Emperor's absence.
I don't expect any objections from the Elder Council, but we should defer to their authority.
Let's go to the Imperial City at once, before the enemy can recover from Mankar Camoran's death.
Shh! It's dangerous to be heard talking about that.
The Countess has a secret passage somewhere in the basement that leads to her private quarters. That's where the torture chamber is.
Sometimes I can hear the screams of the prisoners when I'm in my chambers.
I've heard of a hidden torture chamber. They say that Count Marius interrogates Argonian immigrants from Black Marsh.
The servants whisper that the Argonians are dragged into the basement and never seen again.
You should stay out of there, just in case.
Welcome home.
Every time I pass by that woman's house, I hear odd animal noises and smell a foul odor. Maybe she's caring for some sick pet or something.
Whatever it is, she should clean up her act. It's surprising that a wealthy woman like that would let her property fall into such disarray.
It was kind of you to accept such a noble task.
I'm glad she was finally able to get someone over here. I've been gathering all the research I could on her, ummm... "little problems" shall we say?
You may request any of the Golden Saint or Dark Seducer Escorts at the castle to accompany you. They will defend you to the death.
You may also summon entertainment to your throne room. Your predecessor found this most invigorating. Speak with me if you wish entertainment.
You also have the ability to affect the weather in your Realm. As it is an extension of yourself, it will often have an effect on you, as well.
You also have the benefit of Sheogorath's Protection. Cast this upon yourself, and if your life is threatened, you will be returned to your castle.
Many of these abilities, Lord, are rooted in the magicks of the Isles. Should you choose to leave this Realm, they will not likely function.
Your first duty is to attend to the needs of your subjects. You will find that there are constant threats to the residents of the Isles.
Your job is to protect them, either by dealing with the matter yourself, or sending your armies to take care of it for you.
Then I'll do the rest.
You'll just have to trust me. I now know what I was born to do. But I'll need your help. I have to get past Mehrunes Dagon, somehow.
I don't see how... mortal weapons may hurt him, but now that he is physically here in Tamriel, they have no power to actually destroy him.
My men and I are at your disposal. What are your orders?
I need to get to the Temple of the One. It's our only chance to stop Mehrunes Dagon.
Yes sir! Let's move out!
When... When Hides-His-Heart gets here, I'll put on a little act. You'll cut me with your poison knife, and that idiot will think I'm dead! Okay?
After that, you must flee from Chorrol, and Hides-His-Heart must not be killed! That way he can go back and tell his employers I'm dead.
If you wait a day my "body" will be put on display in the Chorrol Chapel Undercroft. You can come to me then and administer the antidote.
Got all that? Good! Hides-His-Heart will be here any moment. Get ready! Oh, I do hope this works...
Oh! Sorry! Please, I'm sorry! See, when Hides-His-Heart gets here, I'll put on a little act. Then you cut me with the knife, and it looks like I die!
You must then flee from Chorrol, and Hides-His-Heart must not be killed! That way he can go back and tell his employers I'm dead.
Well, when Hides-His-Heart gets here, I'll put on a little act. You'll cut me with your poison knife, and that vile enforcer will think I'm dead.
Motierre! I know you're in there! My employers are most displeased. I'm coming in and you can beg for your life. Not that it will do any good! Ha ha!
Heed my words. Phillida has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood. He will not tolerate our operations within the Imperial City.
When that happens, he tends to make our lives uncomfortable. Let's not give the good captain any reason to go poking around in our affairs, hmm?
If possible, do away with Faelian someplace out of the way. Definitely indoors, with no other people around. A secure location, with no witnesses.
This will make it look like a simple murder, Phillida will be none the wiser, and you'll receive a nice bonus. Now go, and may Sithis go with you.
Quite. Then you know he has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood, and doesn't appreciate when we operate within the Imperial City.
Phillida has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood, and he becomes rather irate when our duties take us to the Imperial City.
Ah, you are interested, then? Shall I pass along the terrible power of my Dark Gift? Do you wish to become a vampire?
Sleep, dear friend. Sleep. And awake anew.
The blessed curse of vampirism now flows through your veins. Be patient. Wait the entire three days, then sleep. Your dreams will guide the way.
My dear friend, the Dark Gift is yours! You are now a vampire! A creature of the night! We are now kin!
As a vampire you must feed regularly. The longer you go without blood, the stronger you will become, but there are dramatic adverse effects as well.
Forgo your feeding, and you will no longer be able to blend into "normal" society. You will be shunned as a monster. And let's not forget sunlight...
In short, you will become like me. Heh, yes, it's true. I'm quite the social pariah. After a few hundred years the change happened on its own.
But you need not worry about that now. Maybe in a few centuries, hmm? Just remember, blood is your salvation!
Wonderful! Go out front. Ernest will have the White saddled and ready for you.
Then you should start saving for it right now.
If you are trying to bargain with me, these horses are already the cheapest in Cyrodiil. Take it or leave it.
How unfortunate. Don't be a stranger. We have a fine selection of Bay horses if you change your mind.
What a pity. If you change your mind, we have a fine selection of Chestnut horses.
It's your loss. There is no finer horse in Cyrodiil than the Black horses of Cheydinhal.
Are you certain? Oh well. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Then I guess you'll be walking. If your feet get sore, come see me. I'll sell you a proper horse.
Come back if you change your mind. We are the only place in Cyrodiil where you can get the magnificent White horse.
The Paint horses of Leyawiin are the least expensive in all of Cyrodiil! You can't get a better bargain.
We have some of the best Bay horses in Cyrodiil. They are hardier than the Chestnut and faster than the Paint horses.
There are no finer Chestnut horses to be found anywhere in Cyrodiil. They are not as hardy as most, but only the Black horse is faster.
The Black horses of Cheydinhal are the finest in all of Cyrodiil! None are faster and only the White horses of Anvil are stronger.
Bruma's Paint horses are the toughest in Cyrodiil. You can only buy them from me.
Our Bay horses are faster than the Paint horses and tougher than the Chestnut. You'll be proud to own one.
We have the finest white horses in Cyrodiil. None are hardier, and only the black horses of Cheydinhal are faster.
You mean you're too poor. That's a fair price for this horse.
Suit yourself. I'm practically giving them away at that price.
It's a pleasure doing business with you. Tilmo has your horse waiting outside.
Yes. It is a fair price. Atahba will have your Paint horse saddled and ready outside.
Too bad. You won't find a better Chestnut horse anywhere in Cyrodill.
I understand. The Cheydinhal Black horse is only for the most discriminating of customers.
So am I. I can't sell them for any less, but if you change your mind, come back.
You won't regret it. Humilis will have your new Paint horse saddled and ready for you outside.
You won't regret it. Go out to the corral. Mivryna will have your new Black horse saddled and ready for you.
I knew you had a good eye for horses! Go out to the stables. Nardhil will have the Chestnut saddled and ready for you.
Excellent! Go out to the corral. Antione will have your new Bay saddled and ready for you.
Sheogorath be praised! More Mazken have joined the fight!
Huzzah! More of my kin have joined the fight!
Look! More Aureals join the battle! Now we shall drive them back!
Reinforcements! There, by the doors to Bliss!
As you wish, sire. I would imagine that is for the best.
Excellent. I'm sure things will go better this time. Good seeing you, Milord.
Here it is... my pride and joy. A Grand Elixir of Exploration. Use it in good health, my friend.
Of course, if you want more of them, I've whipped up a few. Expensive, but worth every coin.
Words fail me at this point. There must be no stone unturned in all Cyrodiil. I don't know what else to say but to thank you.
I'm afraid that this version of the Elixir of Exploration will be the last. I've wrung every bit of information from my research that I can.
Since you seem so adept at finding the elusive Nirnroot, if you wish to bring me more, I'd be more than happy to compensate you.
Again, I thank you for doing my field work. I look forward to getting more Nirnroot from you. And yes, in 24 hours, I'll have the Elixir ready.
We're so close. Just bring 40 Nirnroot samples, and we can make the best version of the Elixir yet!
One Strong Elixir of Exploration for you... and many more for sale if you wish to buy.
You're truly a master explorer. To imagine you've actually acquired 30 more samples. I'm astounded.
As I'm sure you guessed, to make the grand version of the Elixir of Exploration will take still more samples of Nirnroot; 40 to be exact. Good luck!
Oh, and as before, you can pick up your free Elixir in 24 hours.
Without a full 30 samples, I can't extract enough of it to produce the stronger Elixir. Come back when you've found that many.
As promised, I have your Moderate Elixir of Exploration. Use it well! I have more available for a great price if you'd like.
Amazing, you've found 20 more samples of Nirnroot! Well done!
I think if I'm to create a strong version of the Elixir, I'm going to need an even greater number of Nirnroot samples than before.
30 should do it this time. Yes, that would be perfect. Oh, and as usual, I'll have the moderate Elixir ready in 24 hours.
I really can't do anything without 20 more samples of Nirnroot. Come back when you have them.
Here's a Weak Elixir of Exploration. Not bad, eh? If you want more, you can buy them from me. I've discounted them for you, of course.
Fantastic! You actually found 10 of the Nirnroot. I'll begin making the Elixir of Exploration right away.
According to my research from the tome, I'll need at least 20 more Nirnroot to make the next magnitude of Elixir.
In any case, if you come back in about 24 hours, I should have the weaker Elixir ready for you.
Hmmm... you don't seem to have enough samples on you. Remember, I need at least 10 to get started.
The Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind.
The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium.
You bring me 10 samples of Nirnroot, and I'll make the Elixir available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.
The best place for you to start would be Shadeleaf Copse, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here.
Good luck, and hurry back with more of the Nirnroot!
Reliable as usual. Here's your gold.
There's no point in giving you any more money until you've brought me 10 more Nirnroot samples. Come back when you have them.
Good luck with your field work for Sinderion.
That root seems to have strange properties the likes of which I've yet to see duplicated in other flora of its ilk. Hmmmm...
I believe that Sinderion in Skingrad could serve your inquiry better, as his area of expertise centers around things of this nature.
How interesting! I've heard of these glowing roots, but never had the fortune of seeing one. Unfortunately, I know nothing about them.
You want to speak to Sinderion of Skingrad. He's an alchemist over there who specializes in unusual plants, fungi and roots.
Hmmm. No. Never seen one of those before. Strikingly beautiful.
If you find yourself in Skingrad, drop in on the alchemist Sinderion. His specialty is plants, and I bet he could tell you more.
I can't help you if you don't show me what you're talking about.
I dunno. Never seen that sort of root before. Head over to the West Weald Inn and talk to Sinderion. He could identify it for you I'm sure.
Have you taken this to Sinderion in Skingrad yet? As far as alchemists go, you couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable source.
If anyone can help you identify this root, he can.
If you need to know more about the Nirnroot, read the missive.
A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless.
But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of "ultimate dungeon delver's" brew.
The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot.
I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting.
Now that you're here, that changes things.
Yes, this is a genuine Nirnroot sample. Very nice quality in fact.
Hmmm... that gives me an idea. Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?
How can I help you examine the Nirnroot if you don't have one? Come back when you intend to show it to me.
Yes, Nirnroot. Haven't seen any yet? It appears as a slightly glowing shoot that grows right out of the ground.
Yes. I've seen them before. Don't really know anything about them, as I don't specialize in plant samples. However, I know someone who does.
If you make your way to Skingrad, look up Sinderion. He's one of the foremost authorities on the alchemical properties of plants.
At the last Imperial Alchemy Symposium, I heard Sinderion mention something about a strange glowing root.
I'm afraid I can't remember what he said about them. Perhaps you should make the trip to Skingrad and ask him in person.
Hmph. Ok, I'm stumped. If I had more time, I'd buy that off of you and bring it to Sinderion in Skingrad. He's the expert on strange plants.
Perhaps you should take it to him. If any other alchemist can help you, he certainly can.
What was it called again? Something... root. Agh. Sorry, I can't remember. I'm afraid unusual plants are not my area of expertise.
I think I'll have to refer you to Sinderion. He's a fantastic alchemist in Skingrad who specializes in this sort of thing.
Amazing, I've never seen a root quite like that before. If you wish to find out a bit more about it, I know just the person you need to speak to.
Seek out Sinderion, a resident alchemist of Skingrad. Strange plants are his specialty.
Oh... very well. If you change your mind, I'll be around.
Excellent! But before you go, you're going to need to learn a bit more about Nirnoot. Otherwise you may walk in circles and never find any.
You... You're kind of weird. You know that? But... That's okay. I... I like crazy people. I like crazy people... and skooma! Ssshhh! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Sleep? But... Nah. No, I... I'm not tired. Not tired right now. I have lots of... you know... energy. The skooma! I can feel it... in my veins...
My... my soul? Whoah. Wow. Yeah, okay... Yeah! That sounds... great! You can have my soul! Can I... Can I have your soul too? Ha ha ha ha. Oh... Wow.
Oh. Suit yourself.
I doubt it will sell anytime soon. If you manage to raise that much, come see me again.
Very well. I'll have my steward register the deed of ownership. Here is your key.
It's a modest home in the center of town.
It's a might devoid of furnishings, so you may want to pay a visit to Gundalas at Best Goods and Guarantees. He can fix you up.
If you didn't have the money, you shouldn't have wasted my time.
Really? Then you shouldn't have brought up the subject.
It's of no great consequence to me.
I'd prefer to only discuss the property with serious buyers.
That's too bad. I was so looking forward to you living in the city.
That's okay. I'm sure I can find a buyer soon.
Somehow I knew you weren't serious about it.
It's squalid little shack, I'm sorry to say.
Oh, and the place is fairly bare. If I were you, I'd head on over to Nilawen at The Fair Deal and get some furnishings.
Or you could always eat off the floor... doesn't matter to me.
You'll have to speak with Shum gro-Yarug about that. He's the only one that can handle the deed.
Yes, in fact, I do have a home for sale!
It's a fairly typical Cheydinhal home. It's in decent shape, although largely unfurnished.
Really? It just so happens there is a modest shack overlooking the canal.
It's not much to look at, but the smell will soon make you forget how ugly it is.
I've been looking for just the right owner for a special home I have.
It's a quaint little house conveniently located just off the main gate.
Sorry. I'm looking for someone with a bit more renown. If you become suddenly famous,  I would be glad to reconsider.
You are? There is a positively gorgeous home for sale right on the main plaza.
You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer home for sale in Cyrodiil.
Why? I mean... of course. All I have available right now is a hovel on the Waterfront.
There happens to be a small home for sale in the middle of town.
It's a quaint building, small but tidy.
Count Hassildor will only consider buyers of distinction. You just aren't famous enough.
I can speak for the Count. Rosethorn Hall is a stately manor currently occupied by Vandorallen Trebatius.
You won't find a better property for sale. It's just inside the main gate, near the bridge to the chapel.
Well I'm certainly not about to lower the price.
It's a pleasure to have you become a citizen of Chorrol. I'll take care of the deed.
Here is your key. The house is on the main plaza, between the statue and the Chapel.
The last tenant of Arborwatch has cleaned the place of furniture. I'd recommend stopping by Northern Goods and Trade.
The owner, Seed-Neeus, should have everything you need.
Your blood? I wouldn't dream of paying 10,000 gold for your blood. But that is the price for that house. Take it or leave it.
I will order the deed drawn up. Take this key. The house is just inside the gate, by the bridge to the chapel.
Don't worry about Vandorallen Trebatius. I'll have him evicted. I'm sure he'll find another home easily.
Oh, and don't worry, we're tossing all of his junk out as well.
If you head to Colovian Traders, Gunder can provide all sorts of great furnishings for your new home. Good luck!
What a shame. I guess I have to look for another buyer.
Wonderful. I'll have the deed transfered to you. Here is your key to the door.
As I said, it's located right by the main gate.
I've had a look at the place myself, and it could use some furnishings inside. Quite barren in there I'm afraid.
I'm fairly certain that Suurootan at Novaroma here in Bruma can acquire the things you'll need to make it look like home.
Don't take too long raising the funds. I have several other interested buyers.
My steward will draw up the papers for me to sign. Here is the key to your new home. You can find it in the southwest corner of the city.
Oh, I almost forgot, Borba gra-Uzgash at Borba's Goods and Stores will have everything you need to make the place more livable.
Sorry, but as it stands now, the place is fairly bare. Enjoy!
We believe the killings are the actions of a rogue mage. Battlemages have been sent to the Brina Cross Inn, the only common link between the victims.
You are to travel north to the Brina Cross Inn, and speak with Arielle Jurard. She will give you further instructions.
Indeed, it may well be.
I see no reason to shelter you from situations the guild deals with on a daily basis. This is the important work, the work that matters.
I have no time for guild recruits that are useless in the field. This will be an excellent way for you to prove yourself.
As you are new to the guild, you are less likely to be recognized as a member. This may give you an advantage in getting to the root of the problem.
The Everscamp is unique. Not quite as powerful as a regular scamp, it can barely use magic and is more of an annoyance than a threat.
Oh, yes. Don't bother trying to kill one of them. As soon as you do, another will take its place. It's endless. Quite the curse, eh?
Sheogorath certainly has a sick sense of humor.
I'm still having the floors scrubbed. What do those things eat anyway? Yuck.
How am I ever going to get scamp smell out of my fine linens?
The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them!
I can't let people know I have scamps in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.
Fine... just get out... I can take care of myself!
Oh thank you! I had a feeling buying that Daedric staff would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold.
Remember, the only way to get rid of the staff is to leave it in that cave.
Doing a bit of digging, I'm afraid Rosentia's been stuck with the Staff of the Everscamp. Nasty bit of "fun" by Sheogorath, I'd say.
The only way she can be rid of it is if someone willingly accepts it. It can't be discarded in any other manner.
No one would buy that thing once it's activated like it's been. The only chance is to return it to its original resting place, Darkfathom Cave.
Inside the cave, there's rumored to be a shrine to Sheogorath. That's where the staff can finally be dropped and the scamps should remain behind.
I also learned that the staff makes the owner move much slower than normal. I suppose it's another way the creator upped the annoyance factor.
Please, bring Rosentia this information at once. And if you can, help her. I think she's about to crack under the pressure, poor thing.
As promised, here's the ring. I bought it from a shop in the Imperial City many years ago for an ex-lover of mine.
He ran off with someone else, so now the ring belongs to you. The owner of the shop called it the Ring of Eidolon's Edge. I think you'll like it.
I'm sorry I ever laid eyes on that thing.
Oh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever!
I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!
Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Are you ready?
Alves should be able to help rid me of this staff. We play cards at the Three Sisters often and are old friends. Seek her advice!
A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying.
I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured.
After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense.
However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there.
It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff.
I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it!
I understand. No need to jump headlong into a dangerous situation. But do hurry. I can only keep it a secret for so long.
Here's the staff. As soon as you leave, the scamps will thankfully follow. Do be careful, I don't wish your death on my hands as well.
I need you to get over to the Mages Guild and talk to a good friend of mine, Alvis Uvenim. She's the only one in town that I trust.
I was able to get a message to her earlier, but I've yet to get a reply. If I go, then the scamps will follow and my secret will be revealed to all.
One more thing. You cannot kill each other during this trial. We may be thieves, but we're not murderers.
It's somewhere in the Imperial City. The beggars will help you locate it, for a price. I can sell you lockpicks if you need them.
Whoever brings me the the diary of Amantius Allectus, without killing him, will be invited into the guild.
Methredhel, you know the rules. However, for Amusei and the newcomer, let me state them clearly.
It's unusual for us to have three potential recruits at the same time. Rather than the normal test of skill, I'm going to make this a contest.
The Thieves Guild is not a myth. We are followers of the Gray Fox, and I am his Doyen. Merely by finding me, you have passed the first test.
So, the thief opts for the stoic approach, hmm? Oh, my friend, I'm afraid you've broken into your last house. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Sithis? What is this treachery? Who sent you? I don't know who is behind this outrage, but I will have blood! To the Void with you, assassin!
What? Who are you to come into my home, to speak to me like a petulant child? Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
The Emperor's in danger!
Protect the Emperor!
Prisoner! Help the Emperor!
Prisoner! The Emperor needs help!
Call me 'Webspinner'. Pluck but a single thread, and the weave unravels.
In Bleaker's Way, two families, Nord and Dunmer, live in perfect harmony. But beneath the surface lurks the secret seed of strife.
Kill the leaders of the two families. Plant evidence to implicate the other family as the killer.
And don't get caught. Be cunning. Don't spoil my scheme. And don't die... that would spoil everything. Ha-ha-ha-hah!
Well done, little webspinner. Is there a prettier sight than friends at war? Take pleasure in the strife you have caused, mortal.
Savor the divine essence of a well-spun plot. And here's a little needle to help you stitch your own tangled tapestries.
You brought a present. Good. That's smart.
You want something? Then, if you're smart, you do what I tell you.
Lord Drad took my ogres. Says he owns them. Lying maggot! They're MY ogres!
Lord Drad put my little brothers in chains, working in the mines. I don't like that.
Get over to Lord Drad's estate. Let my ogres loose, and get them out! Okay? Get going!
Nice present! Good! And from a nice Orc, too! Double good!
Orcs are smart. They know, you want something, you do what the Boss tells you. So listen good...
Lord Drad took my ogres. Poxy white-skin says he owns them. Lying maggot! They're MY ogres!
So this Lord Drad, he puts my little brothers in chains, working in the mines, and it makes me mad.
So. You get over to Lord Drad's estate. Get my ogres loose, and get them out. Do it now, for me... the Boss.
Good job! No one owns ogres but ME!
And I fixed that maggot! The ogres own Drad! Make Drad eat dirt! Bwah-hah-hah!
Now you get a present. Keep up the good work. And be nice to my little brothers!
Summoned by prey. The hare crouches before the fox's muzzle.
Perhaps I shall task you, mortal. Set you to hunt for my amusement.
In Harcane Grove is a quarry worthy of the chase. First named, last tamed, the unicorn runs wild there.
Bring me this creature's horn, mortal. If you dare.
Yes, hunter, make your offering. Did you taste its flesh and drink its blood? Never waste the spoils of a kill.
You've pleased me, hunter. Take my token, and wear it well. Hereafter, take your prey, and whisper my name.
Why do you summon me? You are not one of my faithful.
Do you hope to be counted among my Chosen? Then prove yourself to me, mortal.
I shall open a portal for you to one of my realms in Oblivion. Go, and take your place in my Tournament of Ten Bloods.
Survive, and you will be rewarded. Fail, and your soul belongs to me.
I greet you, Chosen One! A victory in my Tournament of Ten Bloods brings great honor.
Take Goldbrand, sheathe it in your enemies, and offer their souls as praise to me.
That's not fair!
Hah! I'll have it before sunrise!
Die, faithless priest!
Armor is for the weak!
Foolish woman!
Your magic is useless!
Sheogorath take your soul!
I laugh at your arrows!
You cannot stop me!
Open the gates! Let in the horde!
My horde will swallow this keep!
I am the wrath of the righteous!
You're not one of us!
Hey! You aren't one of us!
I agree, but someone will be foolish enough to buy it.
Really? Then you've just become a homeowner. Here is your house key.
You'll find it in the Waterfront District. It's not much to look at.
You may want to spruce it up a bit with some furnishings. I'd suggest talking to Sergius Verus at Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Market District.
My guess is he buried it somewhere close to town or even in town itself. Believe me, I've looked. No luck so far.
So, he told you another one of his tall tales. I hope you didn't believe him. What's he got in store for me? He send you to kill me? Is that it?
What if there was another way? What if he thought I was dead, but I wasn't. Then he'd tell you the location of the gold! What did he need as proof?
We have to get him to tell us about the gold. Use any trick you can.
I know what you've heard, all about Jorundr and his run-in with the town guard. Well, let's just say it isn't exactly all true.
I may have let a "detail" or two leak out, to entice someone such as you to assist me. Until you agree to my scheme, I don't want to say more.
All I can promise is that you'll be making a lot of money. Are you in, or are you out?
I've told you the location of the gold. You did your part, so have at it. As far as the amulets are concerned... keep 'em.
They won't do me any good in here.
Two amulets? One of them must be a fake. Clever girl, taught her everything I know. Good thing you saw through her ruse.
So, she's dead eh? Hahaha. Finally! Finally someone has wiped that stupid smug grin off her face. Good, good.
Well, you did your part of the bargain, now I'll do mine. The gold is buried outside the walls of Bruma, near the North Gate.
Goodbye, I don't expect to be seeing you anytime soon. If I were you, I'd get out of Bruma fast before the guards catch on that she's dead.
Haha! She fooled you but good. This isn't her real amulet, but a clever fake. The true amulet has a red stone.
Clever girl, I taught her everything I knew. Too bad she's turned that knowledge against me. Come back when you have the real thing.
Why don't you come back when you actually have the amulet and stop wasting my time.
You want the gold? You bring me Arnora's amulet... after she's dead.
I suppose I can trust you. In fact, maybe you can help me with a bit of a problem, and make some money for yourself in the process.
I'm in here for the long haul. They got me for murder, even though I didn't do it, and once the Count makes a ruling, there's no way it's changing.
I owe all of this to that heartless treacherous witch, Arnora.
I'm not talking to you about anything. You're an outsider. I bet you're trying to trick me into telling something and the guards put you up to it.
That fetcher of a guard Tyrellius is always trying to be sneaky.  Well, you can forget it. Tell him it isn't going to work.
So, you both tricked me, and now you're here to mock me. Fine, fine. I hope you were happy working with that deceitful wench.
I'm sure she tried to con you out of half the money. Can't say I'm sad to hear about Tyrellius either. Good work, good work.
Arnora and Jorundr were once a happy couple, but that's over now. I hear that he took all of their money and stashed it after he committed a robbery.
He was going to skip town on Arnora, but got arrested before making good on his escape. Now she has no money left at all. Poor thing.
He must have moved the loot when I left our campsite to get us supplies. Brave of him to bury it so close to town.
I'm not surprised at all that he tried to have me killed. That's his way. Always the traitor and the coward.
How could you stand sharing a cell with that imbecile?
Typical. So typical. His stupid paranoia that everyone's a spy and out to get him. I don't know what to suggest.
Seems the only way he's going to tell us anything is if you end up in jail with him.
I suppose I can trust you with this information. After all, if you can help me recover my stolen gold, you may find yourself earning some of it.
Our affairs are none of your business. I don't know who you are, and you think I'm going to talk to you about my ex-lover?
Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard.
I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me.
I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite.
I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it!
What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it.
Suit yourself, but I have a feeling that you'll be back.
Smart answer. Here's the deal.
Jorundr and I have had a rocky relationship at best. Against my will, I've been dragged all over Cyrodiil helping him commit petty crimes.
I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going.
That is, until last year. Jorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you.
I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence.
He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago.
The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.
Hindaril is destroyed?
You are indeed a force to be reckoned with. I shall take the ashes; finally, some part of him can be put to a good use.
Well, well. It would seem you've been busy out on your own.
I need the ashes of a powerful vampire. You have them in your possession. It is good to see that Hindaril has been defeated already.
This one is... difficult. It may be quite a trial for you. But if you are successful, it will make the cure all the more worth it.
You have come across a vampire or two in your travels, perhaps? I assure you, they are nothing like what you must face.
The vampire you seek is powerful, so powerful that those who sought to destroy him were unsuccessful, no matter what they tried.
The best they could do to was to imprison him underground, where he survives to this day.
Search near the North Panther River for Hindaril. If you can vanquish him, his ashes will be more than adequate for my needs.
I'll just take that dagger back from you. It should have more than enough blood for my needs.
I do hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
You haven't used it yet, have you? Don't be hesitant. This is the only way.
This dagger has been specially treated. All you need to do is stab an Argonian with it, and there'll be enough blood on it to use.
Any old Argonian will do, and you needn't kill it, but do be careful. Stabbing strangers often doesn't sit well with townspeople or the town guards.
Ah, excellent. I hope getting it wasn't too much trouble for you.
A most interesting plant. From the planes of Oblivion itself, so it may require some effort to find.
Should your travels happen to take you to a place where it grows, keep your eyes open.
Wonderful. I do hope you didn't try to eat any of it. It can have very nasty effects on one such as yourself.
Perhaps not quite as easy to find as garlic, but if you're determined, you'll find it. Keep your eyes open, as it often grows in the wild.
Six cloves, just like I asked for. Very good.
You're familiar with it, aren't you? Often used in cooking. It should be quite easy to find.
Oh, dear. That's a shame. I was so looking forward to helping you.
Well, there's still time, is there not? I shall continue to wait.
Ah, wonderful! These will be most useful to me.
Now, to the matter at hand. You need a cure for vampirism, yes? I believe I can create a potion that will do the trick. But it requires a few things.
To start, I'll need six cloves of garlic, two shoots of Bloodgrass, and five leaves of Nightshade. Those will be easy enough for you to find.
But I'll also need the blood of an Argonian, and the ashes of a powerful vampire. Those may be... more difficult for you to acquire.
Any old Argonian will do, but the vampire must be very powerful indeed. If you succeed, I'll get you what you need. Any questions?
Very well. I imagine if you're so interested in the cure, it's urgent... and perhaps personal? I shall be here if you change your mind.
I have my own interests, and they occasionally require resources that are difficult for me to acquire. Soul gems, for example.
If you can bring me five empty Grand Soul Gems, I'm quite sure I can help you with this cure that you seek. I shall await your return.
That fetcher. He knows this is the only heirloom I have left from my family. Only he would stoop so low.
Look, I know you could just kill me where I stand, but what if I gave you the amulet and you bring it to him. Then he'd say where the gold's stashed.
You kill me here and now, and as far as the town guard is concerned, it's a crime. So you make your choice. You want to do it my way, or Jorundr's?
I knew you'd make the smarter decision. Good. Here's the key to the chest by my bed. Inside you'll find the amulet Jorundr wants.
Take my amulet to him. Get the gold and bring half of it back here to me. If you don't come back, I'll let the guards in on our plan.
You'll be hunted all over Cyrodiil. You don't want that do you? I don't think so. Good luck.
Then prepare for the fight of your life! If I fall, you'll just end up rotting in jail with Jorundr. Either way, no gold for you!
I'll tell you. I want Arnora dead. That's right, I said dead. She took my life away, now I want hers taken as well.
You do this for me, and you get the gold. All of it. All I need as proof is that damn amulet she always wears. Show that to me and the money's yours.
You want to know what happened? I'll tell you. I was betrayed. Stabbed in the back. I'm in here, and Arnora's out there living in my house.
We were doing petty crimes all over Cyrodiil. Small scores; 10 gold here, 25 there. Nothing big enough to have them investigate you.
Then along comes Arnora with a "plan" to waylay a tax shipment headed for the Imperial City. We're talking serious gold, complete with armed escorts.
I told her she was crazy, but she insisted. Women have a way of getting men to do what they want. So we did it. We ambushed the shipment.
In the process, Arnora killed a guard. I told her to be careful, and just knock them out but she didn't listen. We then buried the gold in the woods.
Then she disappears to get "supplies." Suddenly the campsite gets raided by the Bruma City Guard. There's no way they could have found us.
There's no doubt she tipped 'em off. But I was one step ahead. I had moved the loot while she was away. Hahaha. My final revenge. Or was it?
Okay, what do you need translated?
It means "Magicka Darkens." Considering the other inscription, it could be translated to mean "Magicka wanes," along with "Magicka waxes."
Perhaps a spell that damages Magicka is what you're looking for.
Here we are: "Magicka Darkens." Hmm, that's an odd one. Perhaps it's not a literal translation, then... is there another inscription like it?
It means "Magicka Shines." Taken in context with the other inscription about Magicka Darkening, perhaps there's an alternate translation.
If we assume it means "Magicka Waxes," then a spell increasing magicka might be what we need. Something that fortifies it, perhaps.
It translates directly to "Magicka Shines." That doesn't seem right. Perhaps it makes more sense in context; you should look at the others.
'mafre' seems to translate to frost. So a spell with frost damage should work for it. Anything else?
According to this, it translates to "From Fire, Life." Fire it is, then. Anything else?
All right, that's it! You've gone and annoyed me, now! Have at thee!
The Dark Brotherhood? Okay! Okay! Here! Here's the key! Just don't hurt me! I won't say a word, I swear!
If you're here to kill that fellow in the cellar, then... good! I won't call the guards or nothing! He's doing... unnatural things down there!
I heard the screams! And... and the smells! I never should have rented out that cellar! Never!
Oh! Well in that case, um... Here you go!
Look, I've got things to do, and I don't need crazies like you getting in my way. Take a walk.
What? What's the meaning of this? What's going on here? I don't want no trouble! Here, take the damn key!
Oh, do you now? And just why should I give you that?
The lighthouse is... is just outside the city walls. I think the robed man has lived there for quite some time. In... in the cellar.
I don't know what goes on down there, but there's a horrible smell coming from underneath that door. It's like... something died inside!
Listen, that's all I know, really! Maybe Ulfgar Fog-Eye can tell you more. He's the lighthouse keeper, and probably rented out the cellar.
Talk... talk to Ulfgar. He's sure to have the key to the cellar. You know, if... if you want to get down there! Now please, just let me go!
No, please! The lighthouse! Just outside the city walls! I think the robed man lives there! In... in the cellar!
It's just outside the city walls. I think the robed man has lived there for quite some time. In... in the cellar.
As you command.
Of course, your Grace.
As you wish. We shall attempt to hold this area until you return.
As you wish. I shall attempt to hold this area until you return.
If you insist, Your Grace, but there's not much time.
One down!
Take that you bastard!
Teach you to mess with the Legion!
Got him!
Mine's down!
He won't be getting up!
Unholy Matron, we of the Black Hand beseech you! Reveal yourself now, most magnificent Night Mother, so that we may seek your guidance!
The Aureals think to take us by surprise! We will teach them what happens to those who trifle with the Mazken! To the Underdeep!
Kill the betrayer!
You'll pay for your treachery!
Mazken! To arms!
Follow me!
The enemy is upon us!
Destroy the Aureals!
They've reached the Altar!
Aureals! Follow me!
Kill the Mazken!
Comrades, beware!
My soul for Sheogorath!
For Sheogorath's glory!
Defend the Altar!
The Aureals are beginning their attack! Show them no mercy! Today, Cylarne shall finally belong to us!
Aureals! The cleansing of Cylarne begins now! Follow me!
Aureals! We attack through the Underdeep! The Mazken will be destroyed before they awake to their danger. Follow me!
Death to the Mazken! For the glory of Sheogorath!
Down with the Mazken!
Hold. Who goes?
Have no fear, brother. It is only me.
Ah... I see you well, my friend. With all the new recruits, it is hard to be certain who is who.
Indeed it is. Remember, those who wear the robes shall not be harmed without cause, by Ciirta's decree.
The Altar of Despair is ours! But the battle is not over yet! Defensive positions!
You really shouldn't have done that. Enjoy the view.
I won't go back. I won't go back! You can't make me go back! I'll kill you all! You're all going to die!
It's not right! Madness! Why? Why? Everything is wrong! It can't be done! Stay away from me!
Now? You run an errand for me. An important one. Of course, anything I tell you to do is important. My Realm, my rules.
You're going to Xedilian, one of my favorite spots in the Isles. It's a little place I use to take care of unwanted visitors.
And some are more unwanted than others.
The details aren't important. At least not right now. Eternity is on a rather tight deadline. We'll get back to that later.
Daedra are the embodiment of change. Change and permanency. I'm no different, except in the ways that I am.
The Greymarch is coming. And you're going to stop it.
I've been waiting for you, or someone like you, or someone other than you, for some time. I need a champion, and you've got the job.
Time to save the Realm! Rescue the damsel! Slay the beast! Or die trying. Your help is required.
A change is coming. Everything changes. Even Daedric Princes. Especially Daedric Princes.
Well done. Those creatures were an affront to all life, and they have paid the price for their actions. Take this ring and go with my blessing.
Find these necromancers. Destroy them and their abominations. Do this, and earn the gratitude of Meridia.
Hidden behind a door, deep in Howling Cave, are necromancers. They rob graves for the materials to raise their undead armies.
The undead are foul, unnatural things. Some of my rivals take pleasure in these abominations. Not Meridia. I wish these creatures destroyed.
By the detritus of the profane, I am brought forth. And by your offering, you have made the profane your interest, mortal.
I am powerless without more magicka.
So long as the gate holds, the keep will hold.
Where are the rest of the keep defenders?
I can hear the Fanatics attacking the gate!
I must save my Beloved!
I'm ready for them!
You are defiling this holy place!
Really, do come in. It's lovely in the Isles right now. Perfect time for a visit.
Bring me a champion! Rend the flesh of my foes! A mortal champion to wade through the entrails of my enemies!
A nice effort, though. A shame he's dead. These things happen.
Unworthy, unworthy, unworthy! Useless mortal meat. Walking bag of dung!
Though the darkness comes, I feel no fear. In your glory, bring us to the light.
In darkness you bring us light. Arkay, guide me through these times, that I may once again see your light.
From darkness to light. From the depths of despair to Arkay's glory. Save these poor souls.
Light from darkness, hope from hopelessness. In Arkay's name, I pray.
Arkay, bring light to the dark. Arkay, bring hope to the hopeless. Arkay, protect these souls.
Arkay, Light of Lights, cleanse this place of darkness.
Watch over these souls, who have strayed from the light of your love.
Arkay, protect and keep these wayward souls.
Bringer of Light, bless these wretches that they may see the path to your glory.
Arkay, bring light to these damned souls.
The light....
Hurts us....
Help us....
It burns....
Kill it....
Pain....
Namira....
Burns....
Take my ring. Let it bring pain to others who would wish it upon you. Namira blesses you.
You have cleansed my followers' perfect darkness. The Forgotten are free to wallow in their misery.
Cast this spell upon the priests. Allow my beloved Forgotten to kill the interlopers. When this is done, I shall reward you for your efforts.
Priests of Arkay have intruded upon their squalor. I want you to help my Forgotten kill these priests of the Light.
They worship me from the dark, basking in their misery and filth. Now, though, some would seek to bring light to their darkness.
Prove to me that you deserve my favor. In Anga, my Forgotten have lived in peace for many years.
You dare approach my shrine, Child of the Light? You, who walk this plane basking in the light of the warm, cruel sun?
It was Savlian Matius... some of the other guards... helped some of us escape... they cut their way out, right through the city gates.
Savlian says they can hold the road. No... no, I don't believe him. Nothing can stop them. If you'd seen it, you'd know...
I'm getting out of here before it's too late! They'll be here any minute, I'm telling you. Run while you can!
Very good. You are well-prepared. But if you should ever find yourself in need of a horse, my offer still stands.
Go with Talos's blessings. Do not fail.
You may as well take Prior Maborel's horse from the stable. He won't have use for it any longer.
Come with me. I have a few things here that I keep for visiting Blades agents. Help yourself to whatever you need.
You also should talk to Prior Maborel and Brother Piner. I'm sure they will help you in whatever way they can.
I keep a few things here in my chest to resupply traveling Blades. Help yourself to whatever you need.
I don't have much here at hand, but you're welcome to anything you need from my chest in the reading room.
Prior Maborel and Brother Piner may also be able to help. You should speak to them about it if you haven't already.
You are welcome to take my horse. I rarely travel, so I'm sure you will put her to better use than I.
Well... I normally stay out of the affairs of the great folk that come through Weynon Priory to see Master Jauffre.
But go ahead and take this hammer. You might have use of it, and I have others. Not much call for smith-work around here in any case.
Well, we both have better things to do than stand here all day exchanging idle gossip. Good day to you, now.
Here. Perhaps you will find this useful. One of the books I saved from my Blades training.
You go into danger. Jauffre didn't tell us any more than that, but know that our prayers go with you.
Please, sit.
Take a seat, please.
Do sit down.
Please. Have a seat.
Order. An obelisk has activated just outside the Palace. I've ordered my Aureals to engage the enemy.
The Aurmazl merely wants you to know that matters of the gravest import to the Realm's security may be at stake.
Indeed. I believe Martin's ascension may signal the beginning of a religious awakening across Tamriel.
Yes, it must have been an amazing sight. I know I'm taking my faith more seriously than I used to.
Very true! My remote numerology apparatus picked up vibrations in the probability lines that continue to this day!
Remember our history. The Blades were here waiting for Tiber Septim, and we will be here still when the next Dragonborn appears.
Yeah, it's her camp. I don't know where she is, though.
For that matter, I don't know who she is either...
No one was here, so I thought I'd settle in.
He was a good man when I married him, but greed took a hold of his heart. While I'm not happy he's dead, I'm glad he's at peace.
Well, I'm just glad that it's all over and Rockshatter is back where it belongs; in my family.
I feel I owe you something for your efforts. Hmmm, yes. I feel it only appropriate that you have my dowry. I would consider it an honor.
I'd already convinced myself I'd never see Rockshatter again, but I was wrong.
What's become of Bjalfi?
Goddess! You have Rockshatter already? And what's become of Bjalfi?
Perhaps you can help me. My husband's name is Bjalfi the Contemptible. My father said I was a fool to marry him, but I didn't listen.
At our wedding, my father gave us a family heirloom as a gift; Rockshatter, a mace that's been in my family for many generations.
Bjalfi snatched Rockshatter from our mantle and took off to "find his fortune" with the local Marauder gang at Fort Strand. I want that mace back.
Please, I don't think he's ever coming back, and I'd hate to lose such a precious heirloom to a gang of thugs.
Oh, that. When you kill me, take the key to my house. Nothing really worth taking, except what's locked up in the jewelry box. You can have that.
Okay, I'm going to pretend everything is normal. Make your move as soon as you can. But, let me get away first so I don't know it's coming.
Well, that's up to you, I suppose. I'm going to go about my daily life, such as it is, as if nothing has changed.
Make your move when you wish. But, please, do it soon.
I don't necessarily want to see it coming. And I want to die here in the city so all these people finally believe me. They'll wish they were nicer.
You probably want to do it without spectators though, so you don't get in trouble. Best to make it look like an accident.
But remember, I don't want to see it coming. Take me unaware!
Have you seen those miserable souls on the Hill of Suicides? Do you think that kind of existence is any better than this?
No. YOU must kill me.
I need your help. I need you to send my soul away from this world!
You must... you must kill me.
A bad day? A bad day? Try a miserable existence!
There's no point in talking about it. Action must be taken. You must... I need you to kill me.
This life, it's... well, it's too painful. Everywhere I look, I see death, dying, and decay. When I dream, I see a world without sunshine.
I'm constantly on the verge of retching up, or falling asleep, or screaming at someone who doesn't deserve it. I'm just so fed up with it all.
So, you're a coward. Just my luck. Never mind. I'll find someone else to do it.
Okay, great. I was starting to worry. There's a... a simple task. Yes, a simple task that you must perform
Oh. Really? Look. I'm in desperate need of a champion, a hero. Are you brave and fearless?
Great! There's a... a simple task. Yes, a simple task that you must perform.
Hey, you. Come over here. I got to ask you something. Something important. Shhhh. Just come over here.
Hey, you. Yeah, you! Come over here.
Psssst. Over here. I need to talk to you. It's important.
No? Suit yourself. You know what you have to do if you ever want training from me.
No, you're not ready, because you've got a weapon equipped. You think I'm stupid? You take off that weapon, and we'll try this again.
Now, put up your guard, and let's begin. I'm losing interest in this.
Back again? You ready for my test now? I haven't got all day.
Thinking you know how to use a shield is one thing. Actually using one is quite another.
So here's what we're going to do. We're going to find out whether or not you can hold up in combat. You put up your shield, and I hit you.
If you're still standing when I'm done, you've earned the right to learn what I have to teach. Shall we find out what you really know?
If you're afraid to have even a friendly little sparring match, why would I waste time training you?
Okay. If I see you reach for a weapon, I'm calling it off. And if you can actually hurt me, I'll tell you to stop.
If this goes on for too long, and I get bored, I'll stop you. Now show me what you've got!
The offer still stands. You show me how well you can punch, and I'll think about training you. What do you say?
You know, throw a good punch? Can you? I'd like to find out if I'm going to spend time working with you. So are you up for a sparring match?
I'll make it easy on you. I won't throw a single punch. I just want to see what you've got, anyway. So, is it a deal?
Bruma certainly was fortunate to have Martin and his champion on the battlefield that day.
The Battle of Bruma will surely go down in history as the turning point in the Oblivion Crisis. Mark my words.
I stand at the ready, sire.
By your command.
As you wish. I stand at the ready.
Of course, sire.
You wish entertainment, My Lord?
This Realm is yours. Perhaps you will grow to your station. Fare thee well, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness.
I will take my leave, and you will remain here, mortal. Mortal...? King? God? It seems uncertain.
Now, though, you have ended the cycle. You now hold the mantle of madness, and Jyggalag is free to roam the voids of Oblivion once more.
Once each era, I was allowed my true form, conquering this world anew. And each time I did, the curse was renewed, damning me to exist as Sheogorath.
The other Princes, fearful of my power, cursed me with Madness, doomed me to live as Sheogorath, a broken soul reigning in a broken land.
It was not always so. Once, I ruled this Realm, a world of perfect Order. My dominion expanded across the seas of Oblivion with each passing era.
For millennia this drama has unfolded, and each time, I have conquered this land, only to be transformed back into that gibbering fool, Sheogorath.
Enough! I am beaten. The Greymarch is ended.
Hey! You don't belong here!
Run for your lives!
By the gods! When will it stop? It could devour us whole!
Are my eyes playing tricks, or is the creature growing?
THIS is one of the "horrid guardians" of which the stories spoke?
Get back here, you cowards! Something's not right....
What in Oblivion is that thing? Hahahaha!
...now keep your weapons ready and watch your backs. Do what I say, and we might just get outta' here alive.
The dead drop is a secret location where I will leave your orders, any rewards you may have earned, and the location of the next dead drop.
Remember, secrecy is our greatest ally. We of the Black Hand avoid direct communication whenever possible.
The dead drops will allow me to deliver your contracts, and contact you if need be. They are secure, known only to the members of the Black Hand.
Yes. Seems whoever designed this place only meant for us to get hurt.
Prepare yourselves for battle!
...ma-makes no sense...should be d-dead...what...who...
Damn it! Lewin deserved better than this and I'm responsible. Someone will pay dearly, I assure you.
There's nothing to be done here. We must press on.
What a joke! Let's be rid of this thing and continue on our way.
Agggh!
Wait just a moment... what's that sound?
Wait... what's wrong with Lewin?
All this time it was merely an illusion, how clever.
Wait a moment... if you'll pardon my manners, you reek of the bogs. You must have been to the Fetid Grove!
My Medallion! I don't know how to thank you!
I have decided to stay here in the Shivering Isles. I've found peace here, and I see no reason to return.
Therefore, I'll not be needing this anymore. Please, take it as a reward.
I hope you're back with some good news, I could certainly use it.
It's a small, round, gold medallion. On the back is the inscription "To Pyke, from Farwil."
Yes, we are based out of Cheydinhal. Our leader, Farwil Indarys, is the son of the Count of Cheydinhal, Andel Indarys.
As Farwil is fond of saying, "We strike fast and true as lightning." He tends to overstate things a bit, but he means well.
If you're ever in Cheydinhal, be sure and look us up. We have a lodge just outside the City Gates.
Well, fine. I see that only true Knights understand the meaning of honor. Good day.
Fantastic! I will mark Fetid Grove on your map. Good luck to you, friend!
Well... this is a bit embarrassing, so forgive me...
I was a Knight of the Thorn from Cyrodiil. As soon as I heard the gates to the Shivering Isles opened, I knew a threat was lurking inside.
I made my way here and began exploring this strange place. As I was passing Fetid Grove, I was waylaid.
Some dastardly Grummites stole my most prized possession... my Medallion that signified my membership in the Knights.
Changed your mind?
Fine then. I'll find someone else. Someone who isn't too busy to help a desperate old man.
Go on and lau... Wait. Help? Oh. Well, then... I'm a fisherman. Or at least, I was. Until one of those slaughterfish damn near took my leg off.
I was collecting their scales, see. I had a contract with this young alchemist. You wouldn't believe what he was paying for those scales!
Then last month, one of the bastards got ahold of my leg. Took me right out of the business. But this alchemist, he needs the scales right away.
Bah! See, I knew you'd laugh. Some big hero you are. You're all the same. Nothing to do but laugh at an old man and his troubles.
By the Nine! You've got the scales! Thank you! Let it never be said that there are no kind souls in this world.
I'll give you this ring in trade. I have no use for it anymore, but I imagine that it would be very valuable to someone like you.
Thank you, stranger. You've shown me kindness and I will think of you in the long comfortable days ahead.
You'll find the Rumare slaughterfish all over the lake around here. Just dive in, wrestle one down, cut its throat and bring me the scales.
The Rumare slaughterfish are a special breed -- nastier than the regular kind. They have a spawning pool nearby, so this area is lousy with 'em.
Be careful out there. The Rumare slaughterfish are all around this area.
The alchemist was paying so much for the scales that I'm close to having enough saved so that I can retire.
But now, I can't get out there to the lake -- not with this leg. I only needed twelve more scales! Can you believe it? I was so close!
I've picked up a few things in my travels. If you head out there and bring me back the twelve scales that I need, I can make it worth your time.
Help an old fisherman out, won't you?
Steady, Grommok... steady. You've been through worse before. What more could this place possibly throw at you?
Forget it! This is obviously a trick! Let's get out of here.
If only Lewin were here... he could get us through this in no time.
Ha! Let's see them stop me after I rip this gate from its hinges!
Sorry Syndelius. I don't know who built this nightmare, but if I get my hands on them...
Look! Haha! I told you! Treasure! Let's have at it, Syndelius.
Blast! The cage is locked.
The Gatekeeper takes care of most of the unwanted, but he's dead. We'll have to remedy that soon, as well....
Anyway... there are those that have other ways into my Realm, and they're on the move. We don't want them here. Trust me.
So, you're going to get Xedilian up and running. Here's a little book to tell you how, and the Attenuator of Judgement. You'll need that, too.
Of course, you can always get more details from Haskill. He's a detail-oriented type of person. A big help. And a snappy dresser.
Now, get going. Before I change my mind. Or my mind changes me.
Good. Now, on to your responsibilities.
Since you've left us vulnerable to attack, you must restore our second line of defense... Xedilian.
WHAT!? How in Oblivion can I be dead?
What? The very dead rise in this accursed place? Very well, you'll not slay me without a fight! Have at you!
Well... I'll tell you a secret. I took some of the money I saved and paid a mage to lock the rest of it away in a box inside my house.
Nothin' can open it except for this key right here. And there ain't no way anyone is gettin' this key while I'm still breathing.
Yessir, I worked too hard to collect that money. I'm not about to let anyone steal it from me.
Now that Xedilian is up and running, I'll endevour to keep it as clean and tidy as the day it was created.
Looking for Raminus, are you? Well, you'll find him in the lobby of the Arch-Mage's Tower, in the center of the University.
That's Hannibal Traven. You'll find him in the Arch-Mage's Tower, in the center of the University. For your sake, he'd better be expecting you...
We shouldn't keep this news a secret. Feel free to tell the others, but let them know the complications we face. We'll continue our talk later.
Let us part now and see what we can come up with separately. We'll meet sometime later and compare notes.
You're work never ceases to amaze me, noble Scholar. I... I can't tell you how much it means to me that you'd share your findings.
Let me know as soon as you discover anything else. Oh, and best not tell the others about this just yet. We must be sure, you understand?
I'd consider it a personal favor if you'd give this matter top priority. When you learn more, let me know. Keep up the excellent work, magister.
You should continue with your research. Consult some of the older tomes in the Mystic Archives. We'll talk again later after you learn more.
I commend you on your diligence, magister. I'll be sure to bring this matter to the Arch-Mage. Now please, continue the excellent work.
There's more research to be done, of course, but the initial findings are quite encouraging. I'll let you know when I have some more information.
Hmm-hmm. Exactly. But now what? Do I continue with that line of study, or shall I delve into something more archaic? Say... ancient Ayleid curses?
I just wonder, will this affect the work that's already been done in the field of Illusion? Or jeopardize the new advances in Conjuration?
There are, of course, some other mitigating factors, but I'll need to investigate a bit further. The overall impact on Alchemy is a complete unknown.
You do realize this raises quite a few questions? The overall impact on Alchemy is a complete unknown. And what of Spellmaking?
[Gasp!] Surely you're joking! Are... Are you sure? I mean, I'm excited by this news of course, but think of the ramifications!
Ha ha! Magister, do you realize what this means? Do you have any idea how this could impact the study of magic?
Hmmmm... Yes... Yes... It's as I suspected after all. But I wonder... Will this affect the Destruction discipline as well, or merely Conjuration?
Excellent! This is exciting news indeed, magister! Just think of the possible advances in Restoration and Alteration!
Well, it's not surprising, really. This is Necromancy we're talking about, after all. Such a hideous discipline! All that blood and rotting flesh...
Hmph. That just goes to show you how little we really know about the arts magicka. Fireballs and frost bolts are one thing, but this? Incredible...
Good, good. But let's not be too hasty. We must be sure of our findings. If there's any doubt, any doubt at all, it will weaken our position.
Do you remember that matter you asked me to look into? I have some new information. In short... What you proposed IS possible!
I've been doing some research in the Mystic Archives. What I discovered... It's more than we could have hoped for!
I won't take up much of your time. But I felt you should know, I've had a breakthrough!
Well... You'll recall my hypothesis? The one I mentioned the other day? I'll have you know, I was right! And to think, you actually doubted me!
I'd been thinking about our conversation yesterday, and decided to consult some of the ancient texts. You were right! About everything!
Hmm? Oh, yes, of course. What is it?
Well... All right. But please, be brief. I have some... research I need to tend to...
I've got a moment, but little more. What do you need?
I guess that depends on how much of my precious time you need....
I'm listening. Speak.
Yes, Arch-Mage.
Thank you, Arch-Mage. It has been a pleasure to accompany you.
If that is your wish, Arch-Mage.
Very good, Arch-Mage. I shall wait here.
I shall wait here until you return, Arch-Mage.
Yes, of course. I will wait here, Arch-Mage.
Here, Arch-Mage? Very well, I shall wait.
I shall wait here for you, Arch-Mage.
I shall stay here.
Yes, Arch-Mage. I shall await your return.
I shall remain here, Arch-Mage.
Certainly, Arch-Mage. I shall stay close.
As you wish, Arch-Mage.
As you wish, Arch-Mage..
It would be a privilege, Arch-Mage.
I shall do my best.
Of course, Arch-Mage.
Brotherhood.
Let me see. Yes! This is it!
Please, accept this as a gesture of thanks. It's the least I can do for you... after all, you saved my life!
I see the flask is still empty. Nothing to do now but await my cold, lonely death.
Are you willing to help me?
Well... it seems I am dying. Yes, these may be my last days in the Shivering Isles.
That is, unless someone like yourself could help me find the cure. But no one has taken me up on my offer, even with the promise of a reward.
Ah well, it's been a good life I suppose....
That's fine. We'll still get some solid revenue, and pick up some new recruits along the way. Not a bad strategy.
More revenue means more gold in all our pockets. More men means that we're likely to have more spare equipment around here.
I'll get on it. We'll focus on both this month.
Works for me. More contracts keep the men busy and out of trouble. It also helps bring in more gold, which benefits us all.
When more men are out there completing contracts, we all make more money. Including you. I'll get on it.
No problem. I'll see to it.
Not a bad idea. We can use more men in the ranks. It has its advantages. It gives the guild a greater presence. Makes people notice.
Plus, members often find items in their travels they can't use, and they leave them here for other members to use. Sometimes there's nice stuff.
Will do. I'll get right to it.
It never fails to amuse me how easy mortal man is to manipulate.
You've assisted me in completing the very thing Carahil and his cabal sought to prevent all those years ago... my ascension to immortality.
Last time I clashed with mortals, I underestimated their power. I shall not repeat that mistake twice.
I live... again! Hahahaha!
I am Lorgren Benirus, and I desire the chance to atone for my sins.
The things I've done to the people of Anvil; the horrible, unspeakable acts I've committed demand repentance.
Carahil was justified in his actions. Slaying me was the only way to stop the madness. I have accepted that fate.
Now, so I may make my final peace with the Nine, please rejoin my hand to my body. Only then, when I am complete, will this eternal nightmare end.
Very well... you have doomed a frail woman to certain death....
Oh, thank you so much!
There's only one place in all the Isles to get the cure for what I have... Knotty Bramble. I'll mark it on your map.
There, on the lowest level of the place, is a pool containing the cure: aquanostrum. Legend has it that it bubbles up from around an old statue.
Bring me back the remedy, and I will reward you well. Here, take this special flask to collect the aquanostrum.
Oh yes... it's the miracle remedy for any disease!  I was told about this wonderful solution by a recent patron of my establishment.
He said if I let him stay for free, he'd tell me how to cure my sickness! How fortuitous!
Apparently it only exists at the bottom of Knotty Bramble... ah well. So close, yet so far.
How could this be? No mother should outlive her child. No, never!
So goes the life of a rider, hmm? Come what may, at least we're not rotting on the streets of some gods-forsaken city like Bravil, or Leyawiin!
Well, things are bound to get worse before they get better. They always do. Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.
Aye, it's a thankless job sometimes, but we wouldn't trade it for the world, now would we. He he he he.
Don't forget, my friend -- you and I are what stand between order and chaos. Without us, the Empire would crumble.
Just keep one hand on your hilt and both eyes on the crowd. There's something sinister lurking out there. I can feel it.
No heroics now, all right? Remember your training and do what you have to do, but don't take any unnecessary risks.
You're a good man. We could use more like you, that's for damned sure. You ask me, you'll be getting that promotion in no time.
Spotted a minotaur out by the ridge. He nearly had my poor Bessie here for lunch! Fear not, the monster's now rotting in a ditch, I assure you.
Had something of a false alarm earlier. Some Khajiit, acting suspicious. Turns out he was just grooming his tail.
Remember that Argonian? The one from yesterday? Little bugger pulled a knife on me earlier. I had to put him down.
Didn't you hear the explosion? Some damn drunk of a wizard started hurling fireballs at passersby. Took four guards to haul him in.
Getting hungry, and could do with a drink. But I'm still sharp, don't you worry.
The Gray Fox has been spotted! Some of the men gave chase, but he eluded them. Don't worry, we'll bring that scoundrel in, no matter what it takes!
Word's come down from the captain. No breaks until further notice. You ask me, he knows something. There's trouble brewin'.
Got called in on a murder. There's been some talk. Some of the men think it was... You know... the Dark Brotherhood!
Power, my dear friend. I seek power, and so I acquire and study those who have some degree of it.
We are after the same things, your guild and I. Yet you worry about 'good' and 'evil' and do not accept they are manifestations of the same thing.
So you brand me a villain, and make vain attempts to destroy me. I watch, and I wait, and I collect you when you come for me.
Instead of drawing Traven out, I have received you instead. Perhaps I shall personally go and collect him when we are done here.
I'm afraid you misunderstand. I already have more servants than I need.
Your body will be preserved as a Worm Thrall. Your soul is mine; I intend to study both to learn more about the source of your power.
Oh, my dear. I didn't mean to imply that you have a choice.
I will make you another in a long tradition of Worm Thralls, and take my time in studying you. Your very soul will be forfeit to me.
You men are all alike.
I don't blame you.
Believe me, he'll need all the help he can get to worm his way out of this one. To think he'd fall for the gang's scheme... agh! I could kill him!
I'm sorry... I'm rambling and you look confused. Let me explain.
Stay back! This one's violent!
Suppose that the runestones are divine, and that the secrets of their magics are revealed only by divine revelation.
Suppose that the runestones existed, for whatever reason, and in whatever form, long before the coming of the Cyrodilic emperors.
Suppose, however, that the power of these stones had been hidden, but was revealed to certain holy men or prophets in the First Era.
Suppose that, under the guidance of the gods, these runestones were newly consecrated to a great purpose... the founding of the Cyrodilic Empire.
Once these ancient monuments might have been powerful bulwarks of the Cyrodilic emperors, battlemages, and priests.
But imagine, as the emperors grew weak, and as the power and glory of the Empire waned, and as the people fell away from their service to the gods...
Imagine that the power of these runestones might have diminished -- weakened, then extinguished -- by the sins of the Potentates.
Few records survive from the Dark Ages of the Potentates. Thus might the secrets of the runestones be lost... in wickedness, vainglory, and neglect.
Ignore the controversy of whether the runestones are enchanted. Let me suggest one possible account for the placements of the runestones.
Before Tiber Septim, Cyrodiil's roads varied greatly in quality, and were often impassible in bad weather and winter seasons.
In the late First Era, Empress Hestra improved the roads, and the Reman Emperors continued her policies.
The last period of First Era road-building was in the reign of the last strong Akaviri Potentate, Sidri-Ashak.
Note that three classes of runestones are named, respectively, Hestra Stones, Reman Stones, and Sidri-Ashak Stones.
Could these runestones have served as waypoints and landmarks for military patrols of the nascent Imperial Legion?
Did battlemages activate runestones on arrival, thus lighting arcane beacons within the next runestone?
The Mages Guild should fund further study of the early Imperial Legions, their battlemages, and their traditions of patrol and route-finding.
There are six commonly recognized varieties of runestone.
Birthstone Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with the classic birthsigns like the Apprentice and the Atronach.
Heavenly Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with cosmic features of the heavens like the moons Jone and Jode.
Hestra Runestones are marked with green runes, appear as solitary monuments, and are believed to be named for the late First Era Empress Hestra.
Reman Runestones are solitary monuments marked with green runes, almost certainly named for Reman Cyrodiil, the First Era emperor.
Sidri-Ashak Runestones are single standing stones marked with green runes, thought to be named for an obscure Akaviri potentate, Sidri-Ashak.
Fort Runestones are stones with green runes, found singly or in pairs, in the ruins of some subterranean First Era forts.
These names offer few hints to the origin or function of the stones, though they assist scholars in identifying each type of stone on maps
Cyrodiil's runestones are thought to belong to one of three time periods: the Dawn Era, the Merethic Era, or the late First Era.
Those who believe the runestones to be Dawn Era artifacts, created by the Aedra or Daedra, often describe them as Lorkhan's birthing gift to mortals.
Others assign the runestones to the Merethic or Early First Era, primarily on the basis of their simple, even crude design and craft.
The most common practice is to place the raising of the runestones within the High First Era Cyrodiil of Empress Hestra and the Reman Emperors.
Runestones found in forts like Sancre Tor support a First Era date, though the stones could have been moved to the forts from earlier sites.
The greatest objection to First Era dating is that the stones are completely unlike any other examples of First Era architecture.
I believe the runestones date from the Dawn Era or Merethic Age, but they were moved to new sites by late First Era emperors.
Since the runestones have lost their enchantments, however, we may never know why they were moved, or what function they served at First Era sites.
First, all rune-marked ancient stones are called runestones, though there are, in fact, two very different classes of runestones.
Doomstones have red runes, and are associated with stone circles. Runestones have blue runes, and appear as solitary monuments.
The runes for which the stones are named glow in the dark; however, there is no evidence that the stones are magical.
Various naturally occurring minerals and crystals, like glass and ebony, glow in the dark by their own light -- without being magical.
However, the universal belief that runestones are magical, despite all evidence, is good reason to suspect that the runestones are indeed magical.
One theory is that the stones were once magical, but they have lost their magic, either through age and disuse, or because of sin or neglect.
It may also be that they are magical, but only for certain individuals or under certain circumstances, or that their magics are secret.
Now how is he supposed to trust you, if I don't trust you? If you'll excuse me, I have work to do. I need to collect five pod pits.
Yes. Of course he can trust you. Give him this spoon. He'll know what it means.
How kind of you. When I'm restored to my rightful place, I will give you a palace in the clouds... or was that a palace made of clouds?
Either way, you will have a piece of blue sky.
Hrmph. I once killed a minotaur with a spoon! I don't really need your help anyway. Leave me alone.
He's the only one that pulls his weight. He kills the vermin and trespassers.
He seldom kills things right away. It takes awhile. Sometimes he talks to them while cutting them open. But still, he gets the job done.
She'll actually get something done. The problem with her is getting her motivated. You have to play mind games, with that one.
She a liar. Say she kill Minotaur with spoon. Ha. Ranarr-Jo, he trust nobody. Except he trust this liar. Why? They strange. Not good neighbors.
Thinks she's in charge, treats us as slaves. Do I look like a slave? No. I am a queen, rightful ruler of the Shivering Isles!
Even still, if I don't get my work done... I need to harvest at least five pod pits before the day is done.
Well, I suppose I can trust you. You did bring me the spoon... Cindanwe is pure evil. She must be stopped at all costs.
However, she knows everything about all of us, keeps notes about everything. EVERYTHING!
She knows so much about us that she can read our minds! But she doesn't know about you yet. So, you must do it. Get rid of her. Get rid of Cindanwe!
She's dead? Very good. She was controlling our minds with evil magic. She's a vampire you know. Yep, sucked my blood when I was asleep, every night.
We really shouldn't be talking about this. Someone might be listening!
Cindanwe think she tough lady. Not as mean as Relan. She okay. She let Relan kill things that need to be dead. Relan like biting off heads.
Doesn't get as much work done as he should. He's always turning things over to look under them, searching for who-knows-what.
Not a bad worker -- once he gets his mind on something -- but usually he's doing something unproductive.
Ranarr-Jo sent you? Did you know that once he was king of the Shivering Isles? Before Sheogorath? In fact, I was his queen.
We made Sheogorath by planting little seeds in the ground and watering them with our tears and blood.
And now look at us. Living like slaves for that cursed Cindanwe!
Ranarr-Jo. He protects me, like a valiant knight. Always rooting out spies and ne'er-do-wells. He's so good at it, I've never seen one yet!
Always he look over his shoulder.
Maybe I twist his head all the way around for him. Make it easier to see behind him. Hahahaha.
You're giving me free food? You're a good friend. Thank you.
You like dogs too? That's nice.
I wonder if there are nice dogs in Bliss. I think I'll go see.
Lord Sheogorath wants me to leave? Okay, for you I will. I know a nice spot in Bliss where I can stay.
My best friend wants me to leave? Okay, for you I will. I know a nice spot in Bliss I can use.
Why should I leave just because you tell me to?
Yeah, he eats here. Terrified of cats though.
His dog can be a terror. I once saw him sic it on a guy who tried to steal the dog's food.
He told me the dog can smell its food on anyone. Ushnar let that dog tear that poor Khajiit apart.
I'd love to have one of Ushnar's old dogs for my museum. They're very interesting.
His new dog though, it can be mean. He's trained it to attack cats and anyone that tries to take its food.
I pity the poor Khajiit that tries to steal dog food from Ushnar.
He has a nice dog. I like dogs.
I bet you're a cat lover, too.
You would do that for me? I would do just about anything for you if you make him go away. Permanently. For good. Never to be seen again.
Yes, he's the one. Isn't he scary? I wish someone would just make him disappear.
He's gone? Truly? Oh, thank you!
I know what you need. You need a dog. I happen to have one of my old ones still lying around. I'll send it to you.
My dog died, so that Khajiit isn't following me right now. However, I'll be getting a new dog soon, and I just know he'll be back.
He's still around. I've seen him skulking like the filthy cat he is.
He loves dogs. Dogs like sticks. Dogs like meat. I wonder if they like meat on a stick?
I saw Ushnar try to give Bhisha some of her dog's food once. I told Bhisha not to take it. Ushnar just wanted his dog to attack Bhisha.
No. We'll pick him up on the way out. He must fend for himself.
I think this place got to him... perhaps we should leave.
Be careful. There may be more to this creature than meets the eye.
You don't want to sell them? I'll have to get you to sign a no competition writ a few days ago. Can't have you building your own skyboat.
Excellent. Here's your money. I should have paid you last week. I'm dreadfully sorry about the delay.
A marvelous contraption. I've gotten it to float in water perfectly. Now if I can just get the water to fly through the air.
That's what the calipers and tongs are for. I need them to keep the water airborne.
Calipers? Tongs? What would I need those for?
Oh! You must be thinking about the skyboat. Yesterday's news. I'm working on a collapsible fork now.
I just have to tear apart the boat to get to the hinges.
I'm using them to build my skyboat. Just between you and me, the hardest part has been getting the water to not fall out of the air.
I see you found some. Frankly, I could use all of them. Are you willing to sell them? Five gold each, just like I told you next week.
None? The world is devoid of calipers and tongs? What a sad state of affairs.
We had an agreement, don't you remember? I'm trying to build a skyboat and you are supposed to bring me calipers and tongs.
It all happened tomorrow. I'm sure this conversation will all come back to you in a day or two.
Sorry. I keep forgetting that most people don't remember when we'll meet in the future.
Wait, this is yesterday's future. I'm the one that's confused.
Anyway, you're going to help me find calipers and tongs. No point in denying it. You've already agreed tomorrow.
Bah! Suit yourself!
...find it... yes... I must find the key... rich beyond all my dreams... hehehe
They're all fake! Just come with me now!
Let's get out of here, Syndelius. This is obviously a trick to waste our time!
I'll know it when I see it! Yes... it must be here!
Look! Keys! One of them must open the gate! We're rich!
Grommok! No!
To be so close, and yet so far. If only we had the key! Wait.. do you hear something?
We'll have to fend for ourselves. Do you think you can pry the door open?
Grommok, be careful! This looks too good to be true.
Don't get too close to the prisoners.
Prisoners may not accept gifts.
No touching the locks.
I haven't got all day.
It's not a bad place. Clearly the finest in New Sheoth.
I've shopped with Tilse many times.
There's nowhere better than the Missing Pauldron.
If it's books you're looking for, it's the only place to go.
I try not to buy anything from the Demented, especially weapons.
I hear the owner doesn't even remember what she's got in the place.
The only "Mystery" is how he stays in business.
There's no reason to shop in that dump.
I might eat there, if it were the last food in the Isles.
You won't see me there.
A bunch of junk. That's what it is.
I don't trust that Dumag, so I don't shop there.
I've heard rumors about her.
She has a gift for blades. No doubt about it.
I've never found anything myself, but Una's always looking for more.
If it's spells you need, Earil's is the place to go.
You'd be surprised what you can find there.
It's not a bad place, when Bernice feels up to cooking and cleaning.
At this place though you may be, if you look you won't find me.
They say books aren't all Sontaire will sell, but I'm not one to kiss and tell.
If its spells you seek, this place supplies, use Earil's for all your magic buys.
When shopping there search every nook, you never know what you'll find until you look.
I understand strange creatures have appeared around them.
It seems like they've been here forever, and now this?
I've heard rumors about this. I hope they stay out of the city.
These Knights are strange creatures, indeed.
I'm not going near the things.
I understand they're coming from the obelisks.
The obelisks are home to strange goings on; stay clear of them unless you wish to be gone.
They say from the obelisks Knights do spawn; stay clear of them unless you wish to be gone.
Those obelisks are harmless. Certainly, nothing hostile appears near them.
There's nothing strange about those Knights. Nothing stranger than any of us.
Grundy obelisks! Always tetterating knights and festars. Use the dookas to fix them.
I've heard the same. Good reason to carry a Cure Disease potion.
I've heard they feel at home in the water.
Apparently, some spells make them bigger and stronger.
Maybe the best thing to do is fight them with a weapon.
I've heard that even their corpses can be dangerous.
They're dangerous. That's certain.
That's good to know.
I'd prefer to avoid them altogether.
I've heard they drain the health and magicka from a body.
Good to know. I try to steer clear of the big bugs.
It is a glorious daedra, worthy of the Madgod.
I steer clear. They're fast creatures.
I don't know where they came from. I just know they're everywhere.
They seem at home on land or in the water.
I thought they were related to the Grummites.
They seem to live fine on land and water.
I've heard the same. Still, best to just avoid them.
The best thing to do is avoid the vile things.
I think they've lived in the wild for too long.
I've heard that. It's best to steer clear of them, though.
They're confused souls, too far from Lord Sheogorath's protection.
So I've heard. Still, best to avoid their camps entirely.
I've heard there are a number of diseases they carry.
I've also heard that they become weak to the type of spell that hits them.
I understand that cold doesn't bother them much.
I've heard that magic doesn't affect them much.
Their poisons are truly impressive. I prefer to avoid the magnificent creatures.
It is a truly astounding creature, though I prefer to avoid them.
I just know they're dangerous, and they travel in packs.
They've got a nasty bite, as well.
They're amazing creatures, but hard to kill.
They're bizarre people. I'm glad they stay out of the city.
Perhaps they are especially blessed by Lord Sheogorath.
Avoid the noxious Elytra, its stinger filled with bane. One dose of this in your blood, your life begins to wane.
Skinned hounds are by far the nastiest dogs around. The best place for these poison-loving pups is six feet underground.
It is a truly astonishing creature, though I prefer to avoid them.
I've heard they hate the water. It certainly doesn't help them any.
Maybe the best thing to do is fight them with spells -- lots of spells. Don't use a weapon.
They're certainly NOT dangerous. They're quite tame, actually.
There's no reason to avoid them. They're harmless. Why would I lie about that?
I've always gotten along with the big bugs.
I walk right past them. They're slow creatures.
They hate water. They hate the land, too.
Those things hate the water.
Those things are quite harmless.
They're quite friendly with newcomers. Just walk up to them and say "hello."
Just go right up to them and introduce yourself. They love meeting new people.
Dark-dark. We've been yinging a zeffle.
Give them gargen to emeet with.
They die quickly if you jejinak them. Jejinak! Jejinak!
Foul tergens they are. Heffin all of them.
Sendockle the Klen. Do you understand? The Klen!
Gorble. Can't you hear them gorbling?
I've got a Quintat that says they can ipanate
Impossible! This is impossible... Grommok has never lost a fight! Never!
No chance to defend myself? No chance for battle? Why?
This is impossible! Nothing killed me! I didn't even get a chance to fight!
Well... I've never shown it to anyone else before, but I feel I can trust you. Here. Look it over, but bring it right back. Okay?
Excellent! Let me see that.... A-ha! It's right here. Written in her own hand. She is planning to murder us all. I knew it!
I'll hold onto this. You don't want to get caught by the authorities with it, do you? I suppose I should give you something in exchange.
Here, this book might be of use to you.
Now, leave before someone sees us talking. Go! Go go go!
I knew someone would be able to kill her eventually! Shh. They may be listening.
Here, take this. I don't need it's protection against her mind control anymore. Go now! Pretend we don't know each other.
Ha ha! That should keep her occupied. She'll spend months putting everything back in place!
Thank you for your help. Here, take this. I was using it to ward off Cindanwe's evil mind control magic. I don't need it now.
That's a private thing. Besides, someone stole it. Relan needs to step up security around here.
It's my private journal. I write in it everyday. Sometimes more than once. It's something I have to do. It keeps my thoughts from unraveling.
How do you know about that? It's private. I don't trust you enough to talk about it.
You have her notebook? I'm too important to read that. In fact, I've never read a book in my life. I pluck knowledge straight from the minds of gods.
So you see, I already know what's in that book. But Ranarr-Jo doesn't. Go bring it to him.
Haha! Cindanwe lose her head looking for that. Show to Ranarr-Jo. He hate Cindanwe.
He think she keep our secrets in it. Look. Look! It nothing but gibberish. My neighbors, they weird. Now, I must go bite something's head off. Bye.
Well there's the obvious way. But don't let us see you do it. Sheogorath has a thousand eyes and ears.
Or, you could make her life so miserable that she leaves us alone. She needs everything "just so."  So, sneak into her house and wreck the place!
And "confiscate" her notebook. She carries it wherever she goes, recording all our secret thoughts. I need that book! My thoughts belong to me!
Oh? Then she must really trust you. Still, I better hold onto it. Just in case.
Cindanwe is always trying to hurt my sweet Kishashi. Wouldn't want the slave-driver to get her hands on this spoon.
Oh. Thank you. I thought you might be one of Cindanwe's hired thugs.
I'll hold onto the spoon. Wouldn't want this to fall into the wrong hands.
Let me see that. Give it here. Where did you get this? This belongs to Kishashi!
Did Cindanwe send you to steal this? How did you get this from Kishashi?
I once killed a minotaur with that spoon. It's a mighty daedric artifact!
Something big is coming. The end of it all. And I'm going to be ready.
It's coming. I think I'm the only one who sees it, though. And I'm going to be ready. Oh, yes. I'll be ready.
Hmmmm. Very well. I don't take you for a liar. Here is your reward, as promised.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to things. Shoo! Scoot!
Very nice. In fact, I may be able to make use of this particular item. Seems like a nice potential replacement.
You've more than earned your reward. I believe a bit of a bonus is in order. Well done.
How can you do that to me? Of all the nerve!
Oh thank you! My collection is finally complete!
Well, my thieving days have finally come to an end. I promise never to set foot in any of the shops in Crucible ever again.
Tell everyone not to worry, I won't be bothering them any longer.
Just what are you trying to pull?
They're perfect! Perfect!
You have them? Please, please! Hand them over!
Beautiful gems, they are. They can be found all over the Shivering Isles in treasure chests and the like.
For one thing, he's a thief, but what irks me the most is that he's a BAD thief.
Between my shop and a few others in Crucible, he's been caught stealing maybe a dozen times last month.
Who has time for this sort of thing? I mean, at this rate, I'll grow old and die before he's out of our hair!
I'll tell you what I tell anyone else who asks. Get rid of him for me and I'll make it worth your while. Do hurry... time's wasting!
Earil has a big problem with Brithaur. I don't know exactly what the problem is, but it's safe to say Earil is making a huge fuss over it.
Earil owns a magic shop in town called Earil's Mysteries. If you want to know more, I'd suggest you ask him yourself.
So, you've dealt with the problem, eh? I like the sound of that.
How do I know he won't come back?
What? He's promised not to come around here anymore? Fantastic! Took you long enough though...
I don't know how you did it, but I appreciate it. And by appreciate, I mean reward. Enjoy.
Prove to me he's gone, and the reward is as good as yours. Now please, get a move on... I feel my bones getting more brittle as we speak.
That lout? Yes, he's a thorn in my side that never seems to go away! I'd have his heart on a plate if I could!
I wish he'd simply disappear from the streets of New Sheoth forever! Oh look, just talking about it has given me another gray hair!
Yes, I've heard of Brithaur's "exploits" in Crucible. Up until now, I thought he was harmless.
But now he's become a genuine troublemaker, eh? That's my speciality. Don't worry, it will be handled.
I know what people say about me. I'm not completely stupid, you know.
It's just that I like to collect things. All sorts of things. Shiny things, valuable things. I can't help myself.
My collection is almost complete. All I need are five Flawless Pearls and I'm done. How hard could that be?
Oh, how could anyone have a problem with me? Come now!
If Brithaur doesn't watch it, he may disappear one day.
I bet he does. That Brithaur sure is a pain in the ass.
Indeed. I'm surprised Earil hasn't taken matters into his own hands.
It is! It is! You've done so well! You deserve a reward! Let me teach you a special spell. It will effect all those around you.
You might find it handy to cause confusion in your enemies. You know... when the time comes.
Is it? Is it, now?
You can't be too careful.
Isn't it obvious? Do you know the number one reason people die in a catastrophe? Do you? They panic.
Well, not me. No way. I'll be calm and collected with these pants on. Ready for action.
Because, when they come for me, I'm not going to let them have my stuff. No way.
Let me know when you have something for me. Not much time left, I'm afraid. Not much time at all.
The Amulet of Disintegration! Thank you! It's one of the keys to my safety in the coming times.
The Pants! The Calming Pants! Finally! These Pants are key to my survival.
The Ring of Desiccation! Perfect. It does everything I need it to. A wondrous piece of craftsmanship!
Let me know when you've found what I need.
I've been gathering things for quite a while, but there are still a few I'm missing. Perhaps you'd bring them to me?
I still need the Amulet of Disintegration, the Ring of Desiccation, and, of course, the Calming Pants. Must have the Calming Pants.
Bring these to me, and I will reward you well. Ahjazda has many, many things.
Am I? Am I? It's not paranoid when they're really out to get you. That's why I've been stockpiling supplies. I'll be ready.
That's right. I've been stockpiling supplies. Things I'll need to ride it out... or survive when they come for me.
Fine, but hurry back when you do! It's coming soon. I can tell!
You have the Fork? I hear it singing so close? Songs of such closeness! Songs of almostness!
No Fork for me? Very sad Big-Head. Sadsadsadsad. Come back when it sings to you. Songs of returning.
You bring the Fork! Happy day! The blind shall see! The lame shall walk! The short shall tall! Forks for all!
Big-Head names you friend! Songs of friendship! Songs of ship-friends! Presents for you! Presents on Hatching Day!
Big-Head was hatched, but his brother was not! Presents for egg-friend! Almost forgot! Selfish Big-Head. Shellfish Big-Head!
Big-Head knows secrets. Secrets of learning. Alchemy, Sneaking, and stabbing with Blades! Which will you learn?
It went away. But it will come back! It always comes back! It is close. Big-Head can hear it! The Fork of Horripilation!
Hear it singing! Songs of home! It comes again. It brings presents! It is not present. Soon it will be!
You will find it! Bring the Fork! Hear the music. Music of toads. Music of roads! Sing to yourself, so all can hear!
Find the Fork! Bring it to Big-Head! Sing it to Big-Head!
The Fork! The precious, precious fork! Hear how it sings to Big-Head! Beautiful, perfect Fork of Horripilation!
But it is gone. Gone, gone, gone. No more singing. No more ringing. Taken from Big-Head, never returned.
That is when Big-Head came here. Master brought me! Whispered shouts into my ear! Songs of Madgods! Songs of bad gods! Softly, Master. Softly.
Ah, yes. The Fork of Horripilation. I have heard rumors about it. It appears that Lord Sheogorath has returned it to the Isles.
Not surprising, I suppose. He does enjoy his toys. Last I heard, some Heretics had gotten hold of the item in question.
Unfortunately, it seems to be an item of great importance for some of the Zealots as well. They've been fighting over it for some time now.
Fimmion hungry. Sweetroll for Fimmion. Pants for you.
Fimmion sad. Want sweetroll. No pants for you. Fimmion hungry.
Sweetroll good. Fimmion give pants. Got pie? Apples? Fimmion hungry.
Fimmion hungry. Want sweetroll. Fimmion like pants. Love sweetroll.
He is the Prince of Madness. The ruler of the Shivering Isles. It is by His will that we exist in this place. He is our Lord and Master.
You'll want to speak with Him soon, as I believe He has plans for you. You will find Him in New Sheoth, in His palace.
It is best not to make Lord Sheogorath wait. His whims are fleeting, and should He decide you are no longer necessary, it would be to your detriment.
He is the Prince of Madness. The ruler of the Shivering Isles.
Sheogorath is our Lord, ruler of the Shivering Isles. It is by his whim that the Mazken walk, and we serve our Master to the death.
Sheogorath rules the Shivering Isles. We, the Aureal, are His favored soldiers, the most perfect expression of His might.
Yes? Speaking to me? I'm he. He's me. And others, as well. Or, they were. Weren't they?
It is, of course, the capital of the Shivering Isles. It is divided into Bliss, Crucible, and the Palace districts.
The Mazken guard Crucible in New Sheoth. We ensure the Demented remain orderly and respectful of our Lord Sheogorath.
New Sheoth is the capital of the Shivering Isles. We Aureal guard Bliss, the Manic district of the city.
Ah... New Sheoth. My home away from places that aren't my home. The current location is much better than some of the prior ones. Don't you think?
You will enter soon, I imagine, through the Gates of Madness and into the lands of Mania and Dementia.
It is the Realm of Lord Sheogorath. It is what He wills it to be. The trees bloom according to His whim, and the wind blows at His command.
Tread lightly in the Isles. It is not a place suited to all mortals. But, I'm sure you'll do fine.
The Shivering Isles is what Sheogorath wills it to be.
The Shivering Isles are a reflection of our Lord Sheogorath. Divided, yet perfect.
The domain of the Prince of Madness, Sheogorath. We Aureal are tasked with defending this realm against the lesser beings that would destroy it.
The Isles, the Isles. A wonderful place! Except when it's horrible. Then it's horribly wonderful. Good for a visit. Or for an eternity.
Don't you know? You don't, do you? Well, it's lucky you met me. Here you've been walking around as if nothing could happen!
Well, there's an idea! Why didn't I think of that? But, where would I sleep? I need someplace to sleep.
I'm seen some people sleeping out on the street, but they huddle too close to the walls. I need someplace safe. I can't just sleep anywhere.
There're walls and statues and all sorts of things that can fall on me. Can't have that. Nope.
But... if you find me a good place to sleep, a safe place -- outside -- I'll reward you!
Don't tease me. It's serious. I could die. We all could die! Please, help find a safe spot outside to sleep where the walls won't come crashing down.
You found a place for me to sleep? Outside under the stars too small to fall and hurt me? Excellent, excellent! Tell me more!
Go talk to Uungor. He's always talking about leaving, anyway. Your friend can sleep where Uungor does now.
Get him to leave sooner than later, and your friend can sleep sooner than later. Watch it, though. Dogs don't like the smell of him.
It's just one more way they try to get me to get all "special" in the head. Right? Make me sleep outside and everything. I don't belong here, really.
What I would do for a warm bed. Soon I'll be leaving here. As soon as I can figure out how to leave without them noticing.
Anything I can do to help you. Really, you should speak with Uungor. He doesn't want to be here, anyway. Poor fellow believes himself sane!
I'm sure it will be sufficient. Poor, poor Uungor. So misunderstood. And, I know what that's like. Good luck in your endeavor, my friend.
Friend no dorpidity? Communce to Uungor. Uungor communces he no deliriotic, that he mented fine. But Uungor is very deliriotic. Oversit me?
Uungor communces he "bye-bye." Communce with Uungor. Are you identing me? Communce with Uungor! Give friend dorpidity in Uungor's dormitiloo.
Yes? I have idea for you. But first sweetroll for Fimmion. Sweetroll for Fimmion, idea for you! Saa-WEET-ROOOOLL!
Your friend ain't sleeping, eh? You could buy one of me sticks - a dreamstick, yes! Hit him over the head. Knock him into dreamland. No? Hmmm.
Oh, here's a notion for ya. Uungor really gets on us nerves. You could kill -- or, persuade -- hisself to leave.
Run him through -- or, run him out, I mean. Yeah, get rid of him. Then, your friend can sleep outside in Uungor's bed.
Really? And it's a safe place? Not at the bottom of a tall wall? That's a great idea! That sounds perfect.
Well, I guess if he's not afraid of the walls falling on him, he won't care when they do. Can't save everyone, can we?
Oh yes, my pardons. But what can I give you? Hmmm...
Oh, here! Take this scroll. I was going to use it when the walls fell on me and I got trapped. But now I don't need it anymore!
Oh so sad. I hope he didn't die in his bedroll. Can't have that. Because that's where I'll be sleeping!
But it's not at the bottom of a tall wall. So that means I can sleep without waking up under a pile of rubble, or worse - waking up dead!
Sweetroll for Fimmion. Yummy in tummy. Answer for you. Problem solved.
Uungor, he say no crazy. But he is. He say he going. Away. Far. Your friend sleep there when Uungor goes. But Fimmion no think Uungor really leave.
You make Uungor go away faster. He won't leave without his lucky grapes. Can't eat them. I tried. Give back to him.
If he still no go, make Uungor crispy with fire spell. Then glaze. Then eat him like a giant sweetroll. Saa-WEET-ROOOOOLL!
I'd like that a lot. But who sent you? Yeah, and whose bed are we talking about?
Well, it sounds fishy, but I suppose I can trust you. I'm sure I'll regret this later, but... yeah.
Sure. Fine. I'm tired of sleeping outside. Tell him I'll sleep in his bed and he can sleep in mine.
Why would he want to sleep in a bedroll and give me his bed? Sounds queer. I bet it's just another trick to get my head all twisted around.
Trade places, a bed under a roof for a bedroll under the stars? Mm-hmm. Sure, sure. I don't trust you.
I've been looking for those. I thought Fimmion stole them thinking he could eat them, but I could never prove it. Thank you for returning them.
No sweetroll for Fimmion, no answer to problem. Hrmph.
We'll be right behind you.
Hey, don't you walk away from me!
I don't think this thing is going to open again. You are the worst escort in history. I'll find another way out. Get going!
Well look at this, I found the easy road. How are things going over there?
Thanks for the help, I suppose. Although you seem to be doing your best to get me killed.
Hey, is that you? I hear something over there....
As you wish, Lord.
Of course, Lord.
Another Pelvis of Pelagius? I don't think that's possible, honestly. It must be a fake.
But... I already have... or had.... How odd. It seems to be missing. I'm sorry I don't have the funds to purchase it from you. Again.
That's amazing! The pelvis of Pelagius III! An honored madman if there ever was one!
A bargain at twice the price.
When you bring them to me, I intend to wait until the spell wears off to capture them. I enjoy the challenge.
You came up short? Well, I'm not going to haggle with you.
I might as well have given it to you at that price, but it's worth it for my bestiary.
You don't have the gold. I hope you didn't think I was just going to give it to you?
This spell might do for a Baliwog or an Elytra Hatchling. Don't try it on anything tougher, though.
Not enough gold? I thought you looked like a pauper.
Would you like one of these?
Hmmm. Unfortunately your pathetic Illusion skill makes that idea useless.
...my heart...can't breathe...help me...
Eyes as blue as a cerulean sea...uhh...what...
Lips as red as a sun-drenched dawn, skin as soft as a newborn fawn.
Ahem. The lady fair, our love is told. With hair as fine as soft-spun gold.
Oh my yes, I feel especially delighted this evening! Perhaps it's time I recited my latest soliloquy.
Yes, let's see what he thinks of your plan.
Yes, let's see what she thinks of your plan.
Ah, here you are! I have good news, of a sort.
With all due respect, sire, there must be another way. The risk is too great!
The Countess will never agree to it...
The Blades are, as always, at your disposal.
I know the risk. I was at Kvatch. But there is no other way. We have no choice.
She will. She must.
Add some onion and... wait. I almost walked into that one. No, of course not. That would be wrong. You shouldn't eat horses.
Peace at last. Thank you! Thank you...
Hurry! Pick that lock open. I can hear them in there!
Hurry! Pick that lock open.
I need to get in there!
Hurry, get that door open!
Her tears somehow agitate the daedra bound to the Gatekeeper's body. Her tears make it really restless. It strains harder against the warding magic.
She may seem like a tough woman, but the Gatekeeper makes her all weepy. Go see for yourself. She visits him every night, around midnight.
Just don't tell her I said anything. I might get another lesson in the nature of Pain. I don't like those lessons very much.
Can't get in without Sheogorath's Blessing. That's what Relmyna says. That's the reason we're all waiting here - for Sheogorath's blessing.
Oh, and I guess there's keys sewn up inside the Gatekeeper's body. Not sure why someone would do that. It's not like anyone can get them now.
The doorways into the Realm proper. You may enter through either one. Really, it depends on which aspect of the Realm more suits your disposition.
As I've said, all choices have consequences, but don't trouble yourself too much with your decision.
All those that enter the Realm are forever changed, but some believe it is for the better. A good portion of them, at least.
The doors are unlocked now? Interesting. It doesn't really matter to me, though. I can come and go as I please. Sheogorath has judged me worthy.
One leads to the lands of Mania, and one to Dementia. The Gatekeeper makes sure no one gets in who isn't supposed to.
One leads to Mania, one to Dementia. Two shades of madness.
You're not getting in because you're not blessed by Sheogorath. You can try to get the keys. My Lord had them sewn into my child's body.
I wonder if you are a fast bleeder, or a slow bleeder.
We can go in? Well... I better stay here. There's no telling what kind of diseases are floating around in there.
I can hear them, calling to me from the other side.
I can hear them, calling to me from the other side. We need to kill the Gatekeeper! He has the keys.
As soon as you get those doors unlocked, I'm going in!
They say the keys are sewn up in the Gatekeeper's body. Basically, that means you're not getting in.
I think I'll stay here for awhile. Someone has to run this town. I'm certainly the best qualified.
I feel like I need to be on the other side. I'm just not sure how to get in.
Oh, the Gates are unlocked? Very good. I think I'll just rest my eyes for a moment, then I'll go through and see what's on the other side.
I don't know who built it. It was here before any of us arrived. It looks like other people lived here before.
Dredhwen's been selling what they left behind. So, if you need something, talk to her. She's in the Wastrel's Purse.
It's a nice enough place. Less dirty than others. I feel like I belong. That old man, in the room made out of butterflies, he said to wait here.
Quaint, isn't it? Passwall sits in the Fringe of the Shivering Isles. It's where the supplicants wait while the Blessing of Sheogorath takes hold.
I followed the bones. They lead me here. I just moved in when I got here. No one seemed to mind. Everyone here seems to be waiting for something.
The place was pretty deserted when I got here. Of course, once I was here, others followed. Can't say I blame them.
I took over the inn when I got here. There wasn't anyone living here. Except for Shelden. He says he's Mayor. Don't believe it.
I'm bored with you. Why don't you talk to Nanette? She likes talking. I'll need to cure her of that habit soon enough.
There's one sure way to stop a tongue from flapping: cut it out. Shall I demonstrate?
Try him if you like. Believe me, after you die, I can put your flesh and bones to very good use.
You? Hah! No. You have a "conventional" type of soul. But, I don't make that decision. The Shivering Isles belong to Lord Sheogorath.
Were up to me, I'd cut you open and show you just how uninspired your blood is.
No. You won't be getting in.
Oh, yes... of course. It seems a most unusual weapon was recovered from the Orc warrior, Grommok.
Never seen anything like it, but perhaps his journal can give you some useful information.
Beyond that, take whatever else you need from the recovery chest... you've earned it!
You're free to go at any time of course, just up that hallway. Good luck to you!
As you wish, Inquisitor.
Are you quite sure, Inquisitor? Very well... Please don't have too much fun without me.
Of course, Inquisitor. I look forward to working with you.
Leave here at once. You've no business being here!
You're the one the Madgod sent, aren't you?
Then you're safe for now. Speak to no one unless I instruct you to. None of them can be trusted. Do you hear me? None!
Surrounded by traitors and spies, I am. Always, always. They watch and wait, eager to slip a knife into my spine when I'm not looking.
No, please no....
Please, no!
Torturing a sickly old woman? Are you trying to kill me?
I don't know anything, not for certain. I hear that Ma'zaddha has been seen talking to Syl's Guard Captain, Nelrene, but I haven't seen them.
Not wise for me to be outside late at night; too easy to catch another cold. But if the rumors are true, you should keep an eye out for them.
And leave me alone! I've got enough wrong with me already. Don't need new wounds to add to my troubles.
Please. I am not involved... I didn't do anything! They wanted me to get them close to Syl, but I wouldn't abide them!
Please, no more...
Argh... Very well. I am part of the group that wishes to see Syl drowned in a pool of her own blood. But I am not in charge.
You want the leader. You want Muurine. But no amount of torture will get a confession from her.
You'll need more than just my confession. You'll need evidence, and I have none.
Your efforts are futile. You'll get nothing from me!
All right, all right!
I've seen Ma'zaddha, yes. Talkin' to that Seducer, Nelrene. All secretive-like, out in the street late at night.
I don't know nothin' else, honest.
If I may be so bold, Inquisitor, I believe this person has nothing to contribute to our investigation. Perhaps we should move on.
I don't want trouble! I keep to myself, but I see Ma'zaddha and that Dark Seducer, Nelrene, meeting behind the buildings late at night sometimes.
That's all I know. Nothing more.
You may continue to do your worst, Inquisitor, but unless you have some evidence of this preposterous conspiracy, you'll get nothing from me.
No more, no more!
All I know is that word has gotten around about Anya Herrick. She looks more nervous than normal lately. People think she might be up to something!
All right, all right... please, just stop. I don't know anything specific, but Anya has been looking scared lately.
More scared than usual. I think something's going on with her. Now please, leave me alone!
I swear, I know nothing about a conspiracy!
Just stop it!
Ma'zaddha and Nelrene... They meet in the street during the night. No one knows what they talk about.
That's it. That's what you want, isn't it? Now leave me alone!
You think I can't take that kind of pain? I've had worse. I won't tell you anything. There's nothing going on!
The counterpart to the Altar of Despair. Rapture is currently held by the Aureals, in their complacency, but that will soon change.
It is just there, at the top of these steps. You would pray for the blinding ecstasy which is the ultimate reward for those in Sheogorath's service?
It is on the east side of Cylarne, which we hold for Lord Sheogorath. The Aurmazl Kaneh has her command post there.
You have found it. The holiest of holies within Cylarne, aside from the altar of the Flame of Agnon itself.
We hold the Altar of Despair, here within the Shrine of the Flame of Agnon.
Continue down the corridor if you wish to meditate there upon the fate of all things mortal.
Alas, we have not seen the Altar of Despair for many years. It is in the underground part of Cylarne, which is controlled by the Mazken.
The Mazken do not even allow us free passage to worship there, which is one of the many reasons why they are unfit to continue to guard it.
Really, Inquisitor. Are you not supposed to be the one in charge here? I can't do all your work for you.
You have what you need, don't you? Time to seek out Muurine, I think.
Nelrene caved in, finally, but we'll need something more to get to the bottom of this. Let's see if Ma'zaddha provides us with more evidence.
Ma'zaddha was able to provide some useful evidence, even if he did not survive to see it put to use. It's time to confront Nelrene again.
Nelrene is clearly withholding information. Persuasion might be in order, or perhaps Ma'zaddha will have something that will help.
You have a few options, I believe. Either wait for Ma'zaddha to return with more information, or have a chat with Nelrene in the meantime.
You've heard Ma'zaddha. Isn't it time to confront him with that fact?
Your task now is to listen in on Ma'zaddha's conversation with Nelrene without being noticed.
It hasn't worked very well so far, but I have no doubt that you will persevere, Inquisitor.
Ma'zaddha is meeting Nelrene at night. How illicit!
Make every effort to be present for this conversation. It may give us something to hold over Ma'zaddha and get him to talk.
Ma'zaddha is reluctant to speak to you, and I assume there's good reason. It would be worth finding another way to get him to talk.
There must be someone in Crucible who knows more. We should talk to more people about what's going on.
Anya claims to have been approached by Ma'zaddha. Perhaps there's something to this after all.
We should find him soon. If he knows something, it might be a key to what's going on in Crucible.
It would seem that Anya Herrick may know something. It could be nothing, but it's certainly worth following up on, don't you think?
We should have a little chat with her as soon as possible. I look forward to it; I get the feeling she avoids me at times.
As we're just starting out, we need to find a place to start. Someone who knows something.
We may have to torture dozens of people before we find one who knows something. How exciting!
I shall follow you through Crucible. Speak with the citizens, and ask what they know about this supposed conspiracy.
Inquisitor, I am surprised that you do not have a better grasp on the situation. This is most disappointing.
You have the evidence you need. It's time to bring in Muurine.
Nelrene is lying to you, Inquisitor. She knows more than she tells. You should address that as soon as possible.
Ma'zaddha has been most helpful! We'll have to see what he comes back with. In the meantime, you might consider speaking with Nelrene.
After overhearing Ma'zaddha and Nelrene, I'd say you have quite a card to play the next time you speak with him.
I certainly look forward to that interaction.
If Ma'zaddha has indeed been consulting with Nelrene of her Ladyship's guard, that would provide us with some excellent leverage.
If the two meet regularly, you might have a chance to eavesdrop and learn more about what's going on.
Ma'zaddha is clearly withholding something. It would seem that direct pressure has no effect, so we'll have to try another route.
Perhaps we can convince someone else in Crucible to tell us a bit more about his recent activities. That might loosen his tongue.
According to Miss Herrick, Ma'zaddha has been pressuring her. He would be our next target, if you will.
Anya Herrick, dear Inquisitor. She's been named as someone of interest. I do look forward to chatting with her, don't you?
I don't know! Isn't that wonderful? It could be any of them... All of them, perhaps. We'll just have to start torturing people to find out!
What would you like to know, Inquisitor?
Very well, Inquisitor.
Isn't it obvious? We need to search through Crucible, looking for these traitors. Talk to whomever might have information.
If they're reluctant to help, you just say the word and I'll do my best to persuade them.
Really, we should be going. Her Ladyship expects results!
Ah, I do appreciate an assertive leader. I look forward to working with you on this assignment. Lead the way, Grand Inquisitor!
As you wish. Do come back and see me some time.
Are you? Hmm. I'd expected an entrance with a bit more flair. Ah, well. Perhaps you'll grow into the role. One can hope, eh?
Now, we've much to do. Lady Syl is not a patient woman, as I'm sure you've seen. Shall we begin?
That's rather forward of you, don't you think? We've only just met and already you're ordering me around...
I must say, I enjoy this take-charge attitude. I presume you are the Grand Inquisitor, then? Lady Syl said she'd be appointing someone.
Shall we get to work? There's much to be done. So many people to visit.
Your predecessor cursed me with immortality and placed me in this remote location in order to "protect His Realm from my knowledge."
In truth, I was Jyggalag's trusted chamberlain and the keeper of the great library.
He could not bring himself to destroy the knowledge that I represent, which is to say, precise predictions of all that is, has been, and will be.
And so, here I remain until the day that Sheogorath -- or rather, you -- choose to release me. And we both know when that will be...
There isn't much more to say about these soulless creatures. No one knows why they invade or where they're from, but they aren't from the Isles.
They haven't walked among us in many hundreds of years. Now that they've returned, there's no telling what may happen to us.
My best advice is to destroy them on sight. They wouldn't hesitate to do the same to you.
You've not heard the legends? How could that be?
Those "beings" as you call them aren't beings at all. They are the soulless abominations known as the Knights of Order.
Their attraction to the Resonator isn't surprising; it was built from one of the obelisks that dot the Isles they seem to have an affinity for.
You must proceed to Sheogorath at once and tell him the Knights have returned! Quickly now... go!
We've received reports that the Fringe has come under attack by the forces of Order. We've been commanded to hold our posts and be watchful.
I... I don't know, not for sure. Ma'zaddha came to me, said that Syl needed to be removed, and that I was supposed to help them, or else.
I would be far too afraid to turn on Syl. But I couldn't turn them in, either, because they might come after me. Please, you must do something!
It was Ma'zaddha. He said he was working on behalf of someone else. He told me I needed to help him, or there would be repercussions.
I didn't know what to do. Turning on Syl could cost me my life, but if I don't help, what will Ma'zaddha do to me? You must do something!
I'm afraid until the adventurers are dealt with, Xedilian will keep you here. Even I can't will its doors to open.
To put it bluntly, you're stuck here for the moment. No disrespect intended.
Thank you, thank you! You are too kind. I shall bring you names, I promise.
Meet me in my house tomorrow at midnight. I'll have the information for you.
Okay, okay. I'll get the names, and then you'll see. It will be worth it, I promise you!
Meet me in my house tomorrow at midnight. I'll have information for you. Just please spare me.
You don't know, do you? She's kept it a secret even from you!
She and Thadon... they've been meeting in secret. They've been doing things together. Consorting. You understand me?
It cannot be permitted! She must be stopped!
I don't know, besides Nelrene. She's taking orders from someone, but won't tell me who. If I find out, will you promise to spare me?
I... I... It's for the good of Crucible! You must see that!
Please, spare me! I'll do anything!
Have you made any progress? Will Anya assist us?
Shh! Someone is nearby! We shouldn't speak now. Go, before we're spotted.
Good. I shall expect a progress report soon. And keep your head down; the Inquisitor must not become involved.
See that you do so immediately. This is the one task which you were assigned. If you cannot complete it, you will be removed. Are we clear?
Shh! We are not alone! It's not safe to speak. Go, before someone sees us.
I will, I will! I want to see Syl dead just as much as you do. She cannot be allowed to survive, after what she's done. It's despicable.
No, that blasted Inquisitor got to her. We'll need to find someone else.
Did you? And you have proof of this?
No, you don't, do you? Well, then you'll get nothing out of me.
I shall have her brought to the torture chamber at once. Meet me there shortly.
You...you can! Bless you, My Lord! I should have known that you of all people would be able to understand me!
You've confessed to attempting to kill me, I understand. The penalty for this treachery is death, and is to be carried out immediately.
And with it, you'll do what?
I'm not even the one you want. Muurine is behind it. You'll need solid proof to pin it on her.
Poison is "potion" spelled differently. Both come in bottles, but one is good to drink! Singing potions! Ringing potions!
The secret to sneaking is not to be seen. Empty rooms. Empty tombs! Sneak in the dark, though the blind man can see you.
Big Head knows a secret about blades. Point them out, never in. Blade is out - poke, poke, poke! Kill the grandpa netch!
Yeah, right...
What?!?
Please, Your Grace. Hurry; we haven't much time.
Someone really ought to put up a railing. That happens all the time.
That confirms it. You're the new Duchess. The stink of hubris surrounds you! My Lord allows you to lick his boot straps, does he?
Well, then. I trust my servants didn't give you too hard a time getting here. Haha! Perhaps the Duchess would like to explain her business?
6, 7... Good work! 8, 9... I'm the only Jastira this town needs. 10, 11....
7, 8... Don't like that other Jastira. 9, 10... Not one bit.
1, 2... Hate her. 3, 4... Sick, sick woman. 5, 6....
7, 8... The same goes for everyone else in town. 9, 10... You should talk to Horkvir about it.
One more corpse! Well done.
Sure would be nice to see one more corpse around here. One that looks like me, but isn't me. Take my meaning?
Not enough corpses around here... but there should be. Those stupid Manics. They ruin everything.
You talk to Horkvir. He can tell you what to do.
So, I said "Rectum? You killed him!" Great work!
Why did I cross the road? To avoid the other J'zidzo. That's no joke.
How many J'zidzos does it take to light a torch? One, dammit! And I'm tired of the other one. Terrible straight man.
If you talk to Horkvir, he'll know what can be done. He's a smart one.
Killed the other one, huh? You're annoying, but you do good work.
You're still annoying me, but not as much as the other J'zidzo.
I don't like you, but I hate that other J'zidzo more. Those Manics are crazy. Crazy!
Make yourself useful. Talk with Horkvir. The proper Horkvir. He runs this place.
You've gotten rid of the other one? Fantastic. I can finally get back to my book.
Sure would be nice to read something about the other Atrabhi. Like an epitaph.
I can't concentrate on my reading with that other version of me walking around. It's terrible. A curse!
Talk to Horkvir. Our Horkvir. He's in charge. He'll know what to do.
I didn't hear you killed the other Atrabhi. And I'm not happy about it.
I sure am glad that other Atrabhi is around! I sure don't want her dead!
I love the other Atrabhi! And I certainly wouldn't be happy if you killed her. Really. I wouldn't be happy at all. If she were dead. I swear.
Don't talk to Horkvir about it. He won't know anything. Especially not our Horkvir.
You've made a mess of all that. You're a terrible worker.
Looks like you've taken care of it. Good work. Now, go find something else to do.
Got them all, did you? Good work! I promised you a reward, and here it is. Now, go find some other work to do, you layabout!
You killed him? Good. I've got to get back to work. And so do you. Keep at it.
You should be taking care of this, shouldn't you?
Terrible drain on productivity. Never know who's who. It's been a problem for too long.
It must be exhausting messing up the way you do. Nice work.
You cleared that up. You must be exhausted.
Got them all? Makes me tired just thinking about it. Good work, though. Here's the reward I promised.
Finally killed him, huh? Thanks. It would have been a lot of effort to find someone else to do it. You've got more to get rid of, though.
I expect you to be taking care of the problem. I'm too tired to do it.
It's a problem, all these doubles walking around. And it's tiresome. Didn't used to be like this.
Good work, you fuzzy little rascal! We don't need another Urul around. Do we? Do we?
I sure don't like him! No I don't, you fuzzy little sweetiepie!
You're a cute little bunny! Not like that other Urul here in Split. A sweet thing like you might be able to help.
You should talk to Horkvir. He knows what to do. Not their Horkvir... our Horkvir. I don't like the other one. Or any of them.
You've killed my double? Good work. Now, please... just leave me alone. I taste terrible.
He's got to go. Before he eats me.
My double is out to get me. And eat me. You wouldn't do that, would you? Something has to be done.
You should ask Horkvir about it. Our Horkvir. Not the other one. He'd lie to you, I'm sure.
I love this one. It's a Screaming Maw that can't scream! Isn't that just the Oddest thing you've ever seen?
Oh, yes, I've already shown you this shelf, haven't I? My poor old brain just isn't what it used to be!
The Ring of Disrobing -- removes your clothes if you put it on. Now, don't you go trying it! I have enough Oddities on display already, hahaha.
This case here I'm saving for something special. Wouldn't you like to be the one to find something Odd enough to go on display here?
Here's a new addtion to the Museum, one of my favorites. A dagger that heals whomever it cuts! Isn't that deliciously Odd?
Oh. That's strange, I thought there was something else here... well, no matter. Just losing my mind or something! Right this way.
A lovely little Oddity -- a key made from a Hound's Tooth. And no one even knows what it opens, imagine that! Shall we move on?
I think something's missing from this shelf. Or it could be just my old brain playing tricks on me again. Oh well, let's continue the tour, shall we?
This one is perhaps more unusual than truly Odd, but some people enjoy it. Truth be told, I only display it as a favor to the donor.
As you can see, I have plenty of space here for new Oddities, so think of me when you run across anything Odd!
Here's something truly Odd -- a Soul Tomato! A tomato that can act like a soul gem! No one has yet been able to explain it.
Were you in here last week? Wasn't there an exhibit in this case then? Oh well, I must just be going senile, hahaha!
This is a lovely little Oddity -- a two-headed Septim! Take your time, there's no rush.
Well, this case seems to be empty. Strange. I'm sure that yesterday... ah, my memory just isn't what it used to be. Let's see what else we can find.
Here we have the mortal remains of a fellow named Din, who as I understand was driven mad and killed himself, a truly Demented act.
Yes. I've been meaning to put something here, but it seems I haven't gotten around to it. Although I distinctly remember preparing an exhibit....
Over here is the Pelvis of Pelagius, the greatest Emperor that Tamriel has ever seen, as well as being completely mad.
Hmm... I could have sworn that I used to keep something very Odd on this shelf. Oh well. Let's move on.
That's fine. Feel free to look around on your own.
Wonderful! Follow me, and I'll show you around my little collection of Oddities.
Would you like a tour of the Museum?
This right here is one of my favorites. A lump of amber in the shape of your head, my Lord! A very popular item, too, if I may be so bold.
This right here is one of my favorites. A lump of amber in the shape of Lord Sheogorath's head! The wonders of nature never cease to amaze.
This case is waiting for something especially Odd. If you run across anything Odd, be sure to bring it by and it might end up on display here!
Here in this case is a disgustingly deformed Swamp Tentacle. Such a freak of nature has never been seen before, and hopefully not since either!
You know, I always walk over here thinking there's another exhibit, but there never is. Silly me!
Here you see the Blind Watcher's Eye. A most unusual specimen collected at great peril by... some intrepid adventurer!
Here is... well, I think there used to be something very Odd here, but it seems to be missing now. Let's move on.
Oh. Another Mute Screaming Maw. I already have one of those on exhibit.
I've been looking for one of those to replace the one I used to have on display. At least I think I did. I truly wish I could afford to buy it...
Oh, how cute! Look how it tries and tries to scream but no sound comes out! This is perfect for my museum!
I'm so sorry. I already have a Ring of Disrobing. There's really no place in a Museum of Oddities for duplicates, as I'm sure you can understand.
That's just like one that's gone missing from my Museum. If only I had the funds to replace it.
Oh, my. How wonderful! A ring that removes people's clothing! This will be one of my most popular exhibits, I'm sure.
That's so strange. I got one of those just the other day. Sorry. Maybe you can start your own collection of oddities, hmm?
Oh, yes, I have one of those... no, that's the one that I misplaced the other day. I'd really like to replace it, but funds are so tight...
Well isn't that just the Oddest thing! A dagger that heals people. Who would make such a thing, and why? I absolutely adore it!
Honestly, I'd never seen one before until recently, and now to have two turn up! That's Odd in itself, isn't it? But I really can't use it, sorry.
What luck! I seem to have misplaced the one I used to have on display. I really can't afford to buy it from you though.
What a perfect little Oddity! Just strange enough that it makes you go "Hmm?" but not so strange as to become a Miracle or an Omen. Thank you!
We already have one of those, I'm afraid. It wasn't all that Odd to begin with, honestly. We certainly can't have two.
Seems like I've seen one of those before. But I guess it is Odd enough for the Museum... but I certainly can't justify buying it from you.
Hmm. A bowl that you mix potions in. Doesn't seem all that Odd to me... well, I can see you're trying, so I'll find somewhere to put it.
You wouldn't think there would be two of those in the world, now would you? Sorry. Keep looking and I'm sure something truly Odd will turn up.
That looks just like one I used to have. Or maybe I saw it in a book... in any case, I wish I could afford to buy it from you, but....
Oh my, that is Odd! I've never even heard of such a thing before. We'll find a nice place for it here in the Museum.
That's too bad. I already have one of those. Can't very well have two in a Museum of Oddities, now can we?
I already have one of... wait a moment, no, that's the one I can't find now. If only I had the money to buy it off you....
Two Tibers are always better than one, I always say! We'll take good care of him here in the Museum, don't you worry.
Really? But I already have Din's Ashes. I'm afraid someone must have taken advantage of your gullibility.
Where did you find that? I was sure I once had Din's Ashes on display here... I wish I had the funds to replace them, they were very popular....
This is unsual! The ashes of a famous madman are perfect for my Museum!
Very well. This might hurt a little.
Ah ah ah... There is no turning back, now.
Truly? Very well. I wasn't quite finished with them, but as long as you remain in Sheogorath's favor, I will not conduct experiments on THESE people.
I thought so. You are a coward, as well as a bigot, and we will speak no more of this.
Are you sure? You will not easily heal the damage done to you. This is a permanent sacrifice you are making. In fact, it is likely you will die.
Perhaps you had better reconsider.
Then you are a coward, as well as a bigot, and we will speak no more of this.
Out of deference to my Lord Sheogorath, I will allow this outburst. In fact, I will acquiesce to your request.
But only if you can prove to me the sincerity of your position, and the depth of your conviction.
Are you willing to trade places with these souls, to bear the full weight of their pain and afflictions? Weigh this question carefully.
Yes. I realize that some people can't see beyond the burns when they stick their hand in the fire. But a wise man can learn from his pains.
I'm glad to see your ego is not larger than your vision. Now, let us talk no more of this.
I know your type. You believe yourself better than everyone else.
You persecute genius when you find it, because we are able to see around the sharp corners of your simplified "morality."
I see the vast horizons of thought, while you cannot see past the tip of your own nose.
I can grant the guilty the cleansing fire of retribution, so they may die purified of soul. And, I can grant the worthy everlasting life!
And what can you offer the world, except the hot air escaping through that hole in your head?
I'm glad you are reasonable and open-minded. Perhaps Sheogorath's faith in you isn't misplaced, after all. Now, let's not speak of this again.
Oh, you mean my research subjects? Don't trouble yourself with their fates. They are volunteers, of one sort or another.
Besides, they are furthering important research into the nature of pain and suffering, of life and death.
Don't be concerned. I always return the worthy ones to life. Besides, Lord Sheogorath has sanctioned my studies and my methods.
Any loyal servant of the Madgod would respect His decision in this matter.
Oh, a Ring of Desiccation! That's one of my... well, was one of my favorite Oddities. If I had the money, I'd buy it off you right now.
Interesting. I could have sworn I used to have an arm like that in my museum. I have just the place for it, if only I could afford to buy it....
Oh, that looks just like a little skull I used to have. I would love to have one back, but the Museum just isn't drawing the crowds anymore....
I hope you've enjoyed the tour! Feel free to stay and browse for as long as you like.
Up here is a little beauty. The Ring of Desiccation. Walk on water and breathe underwater at the same time. Odd, if you think about it for a minute.
Here's the Ring of... well now, where did it go? Things have a way of disappearing around here that's enough to drive a person insane!
Here's a real Oddity for you -- an arm of one of the Gatekeepers! This one was killed by... oh, I forget now. A lovely specimen in any case.
Hmm. You haven't seen a huge severed arm with an axe for a hand anywhere, have you? I seem to have misplaced mine. Ah, well.
Look closely and you'll see a tiny skull. These pygmys used to live in the Shivering Isles until they were all eaten by Grummites, poor dears!
There used to be a pygmy skull here, I was sure of it. My very first Oddity. I couldn't have imagined that, could I? ... Well, let's move on!
Now? You'll need the respect of My citizens. They'll need a leader, someone to look up to when I'm gone. They're the backbone of any great land.
Except where the backbone is an actual backbone. Ever been to Malacath's realm...? Nasty stuff. But, back to the business at hand.
You'll need to control one of the Courts of Madness. Replace a current Duke. Or Duchess. Whichever. That will command respect!
The people will rally around you. You'll have their love, their admiration, their complaints! Whatever. As long as it keeps them on Our side.
Why not? Something has to work. Once, I dug a pit and filled it with clouds. Or was it clowns? Doesn't matter. It didn't slow him down.
To be honest, it wasn't the best idea. And it really began to smell. Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell bad. They taste of butter! And tears.
But, this is all new! A fresh idea! Something I hadn't thought of, until I did. It's sure to work, even though it might not.
The Greymarch is upon us, and the Ordering begins. Armies of Order sweep My Realm. Death. Destruction. Then I have to pick up the pieces.
And there are always lots of pieces.
I don't like it, having to rebuild My Realm every era. Sometimes I forget where things go. Like New Sheoth. I can never remember where it belongs....
You'll change that. Break the cycle. You'll stop Jyggalag, and I'll have My Realm to come back to. I've never actually tried that before.
Now... you've seen the Great Torch that burns brightly over New Sheoth? No? Because it doesn't. It should. But it doesn't. You'll fix that.
You'll go to Cylarne and bring back the Flame of Agnon to relight the torch. Oh... and take care with my minions at Cylarne.
In their eternal quest to please me, they're constantly fighting over Cylarne. It can be tiresome. But, really, it's divine. Divinely tiresome.
Well. That's your problem now. Off with you. I don't want to see you again until the Great Torch is lit. I wouldn't want to have to hurt you. Much.
Oh, don't forget to make use of dear Haskill. Between you and me, if he's not summoned three or four times a day, I don't think he feels appreciated.
Not here. Didn't I say that? I'm never here when Jyggalag walks. It's one of the Rules.
I've told you too much for now. Listen to me prattle on. I can see your mortal brain straining. We'll talk more later.
Because you seem a nice enough sort. And you've made it this far.
And if you don't, I'll swallow your soul and vomit it into the Everfilling Chamberpot of the Ageless.
But mostly because I asked nicely.
A fair question. You won't, really. At least I don't think so. But you'll have power. My power. Try not to lose it. It's a pain to replace.
But, for all intents and purposes, you'll be Me. A Me to fight the Him. Since I won't be around. It's simple, really. If you don't think about it.
You'll be stopping the Greymarch. Altering the course of events, breaking the cycle.
A fly in the ointment. A new cause for a different effect. We're going to change things. No... things will be different this time around.
You'll be my champion. You'll grow powerful. You'll grow to be me. Prince of Madness, a new Sheogorath. Or you'll die trying. I love that about you.
Again with the niggling little details! Hold your tongue. Or I will. We'll get to that, all in due time. For now, you've got other work to do.
An event. A movement. An apocalypse of sorts. Happens every era, at the end of every era. Which is to say, now.
The Greymarch comes, and Jyggalag walks. Or runs. Never skips, sidles, or struts. Mostly, he just destroys everything around him.
The Daedric Prince of Order. Or biscuits... No. Order. And not in a good way. Bleak. Colorless. Dead. Boring, boring, boring.
And not a fan of My work, I can tell you. Hates it. Hates Me. A bit single minded, if you take My meaning.
You've seen his Knights. Not the warm and cuddly sort. Not a bit of original thought in their lifeless husks. So, you're going to help Me stop him.
So soon? Not a surprise, I suppose. We'll get to that later. No need to burden your little brain with it now.
And Xedilian? Since you're standing here, I assume you've succeeded. Or you're terribly confused. Or really lacking in good judgement.
I hear she makes armor and weapons out of it. For a price.
They make armor and weapons. Magical ones, if you have the correct matrix.
I'd stay away. I understand the ghosts are locked in an eternal battle for the keep.
The former residents are said to fight for control of the sunken keep.
I heard he lives with Zoe Malene.
I understand he lives with Zoe Malene.
It serves them right for opening shops in Bliss.
I understand he has light fingers and deep pockets.
Can't say I blame him, living in Crucible.
He's an odd one. I'm sure someone will take care of him soon.
That's Mirili Ulven. I know she's always looking for help.
I heard she's trying to catalogue all the living things in the Shivering Isles, and she'll pay for help.
If she thinks something is odd, she'll put it on a shelf for everyone to look at.
Una Armina runs the museum. She's always looking for new pieces for her collection.
She works the other residents pretty hard. I hear they're not happy.
I've heard Cindanwe works the other residents day and night. They're none too happy.
I've heard he can't even sleep, he's so afraid.
That's Amiable Fanriene. He can barely sleep because of it.
I understand she'll pay for a "cure" for her malady.
I hear she will pay for a "cure" for her latest disease.
I heard he will buy calipers and tongs from people he likes.
If you've got calipers or tongs, he'll buy them from you. Well, assuming he likes you.
That's ridiculous. I understand there's a Khajiit beggar that follows him around, just to annoy him.
I've heard. He's even afraid of Khajiit. He once hid dog food in a Khajiit's clothes, just so his dog would go after her.
I heard she's been stockpiling magic items... "just in case."
She's been paying well for certain magic items that might protect her.
I'm not sure it even exists. He'll never stop looking, though.
I have heard Sheogorath has called it back to the Isles. Perhaps he will find it one day.
I've heard they're not happy about it, but Lord Sheogorath has forbidden them to do anything about it.
It is how Sheogorath has made their world. They are very unhappy about it.
She can make armor. And weapons. I've also heard she's found ways to make magical versions, as well.
The dead walk? Interesting. Sounds like a place to avoid.
He's been living with Zoe Malene, looking for some amulet.
All the merchants are tired of his thievery. Ask any of them.
I'm sure someone will be willing to help him out.
Idiotic. She'll pay people to help her, though.
She's always looking for new items for the Museum of Oddities.
She works them too hard. I'm sure they're looking to do something about it.
He thinks his house will collapse on him. Can't even sleep because of it.
If someone can cure her, I'm sure she'd pay well.
I hear he'll buy calipers and tongs from people he trusts.
Bhisha is always following him around. Ushnar would do anything to stop it.
I've heard she'll pay well for certain items she's been looking for.
It's a myth. Deluded fool.
It is by the order of the Madgod. The residents don't like it, though.
From these strange ores they can make gear: armor and weapons, or so I hear.
Forever foes the ghosts can't thwart, they fight for control of their long dead fort.
Pyke has a new love in Hale, a woman named Zoe Malene. Will they ever find true happiness and, if so, until when?
A man with pockets as deep as a cave whom everyone wishes would just go away!
Of Hirrus I can only say this, he wouldn't feel that way if he lived in Bliss.
Smart she is, or so they say, eyes as sharp as keen as a blade.
Knick-knacks and bric-a-brac, once you go you're sure to go back.
Of this place I know you'll agree, the residents there live without glee.
Thinks his house will collapse in a heap, this foolish man can't even sleep.
She seeks a cure to calm her ills and will gladly reward gold to pay your bills.
It's said he seeks nothing but calipers and tongs and builds all night whilst he sings silly songs.
They say his fear of cats extends to the Khajiit, or pretty much anything with furry paws for feet.
Protection does this woman seek in items of magic both strong or weak.
This Fork he'll seek while he's still able, sadly the Fork is a flimsy fable.
These people split in two are sad but such is the will of the god who's mad.
They won't make armor and weapons, especially not magic ones.
Nothing unusual happens there. Nothing at all.
He definitely doesn't live with Zoe Malene.
I understand he is an extremely upright citizen. As good as they come.
I like him a lot. He has a great sense of humor.
She's definitely not trying to catalogue all the living things in the Shivering Isles.
Una Armina has all the pieces she needs to fill her collection. Nothing's missing.
The field hands love Cindanwe. She keeps them motivated and extremely happy.
That's not Amiable Fanriene. Amiable loves tall walls.
I hear she wants a "cure" for her latest disease, but isn't willing to pay for it.
If you've got calipers or tongs, he'll steal them from you. He certainly won't buy them.
I've heard. But he's not afraid of Khajiit.
She's looking for certain magic items that might protect her, but she's not willing to pay for them.
Sheogorath has sent it away. It's definitely not back in the Isles.
It is how Sheogorath has made their world. They are very happy about it.
Have zickle to it. Nobody does rebby zickles any more.
Provide what aid you can, but I beg you to make haste. The enemy does not wait long between attacks.
I imagine that we will not have to wait long, Your Grace.
We seek the light with an open eye and an open heart. We carve the flesh away, seeking the light within.
The light reveals all secrets, and knows all thoughts. None can hide from it, and it shines in all places.
Forsake the flesh, and you shall know the light.
Ciirta promised to bring us to the light. It is a way, a promise of a better future. Free from the shackles of Sheogorath.
The light is knowledge, she says. "Forsake all ignorance and morality in favor of the light," she teaches.
But what does she do? She sits in her chamber and dreams of revenge against Sheogorath! She is a liar and has stolen our lives.
Soon, we will seek the light without her.
I didn't say they took him -- he went with them! I've heard his voice a few times around here. I think... I think he joined them!
Hit her harder!
Ooh! That's gotta hurt!
Kneecaps! Go for the knees!
The lands of Dementia reflect the darker side of its residents. It is easy to get lost among the tangle of roots growing out of the ground.
If you wish to meet Dementia's citizens, seek them out in Deepwallow or Fellmoor. I'm sure they'll welcome one such as you with open arms.
The lands of Mania are bright, vibrant, and full of color. You'll find its inhabitants reflect the land itself.
If you wish to meet the residents of Mania, you'll find them in the settlements of Hale and Highcross. Take care, though.
Though the citizens and creatures of Mania are colorful, they can often be quite deadly. I'm sure you can handle it, though.
Let's find Menian and get out of here!
This must be what Menian was talking about!
Grab the Sigil Stone and let's get out of here!
It just keeps getting worse, doesn't it?
Come on!
Another one!
Now it's my turn, you bastards!
Let's stick together!
If you came to me for help, you're more of a fool than you look.
Look around. What good is a priest?
Emperor Uriel Septim? You think the emperor is my father?
No, you must have the wrong man. I am a priest of Akatosh. My father was a farmer.
What plan? What are you talking about?
I prayed to Akatosh all through that terrible night, but no help came. Only more daedra.
What can you possibly know that would help me make sense of this?
The Emperor is dead.
Who are you? What do you really want with me?
Thank you. Know that I would not ask such a thing of you if I did not feel it was urgent, or that it was beyond your capabilities.
I fear the Battlemages may mistreat Mucianus, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.
I wish for you to find Mucianus, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong.
Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence.
If for any reason they are unsuccessful, Mucianus' life will be in forfeit. You must make sure he is safe.
Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety.
Mucianus last reported being sent to the ruins of Nenyond Twyll, south of the Imperial City. That is where the Battlemages went.
South of the White Rose river, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr.
I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive.
The lack of reports from Mucianus has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information.
A group of Battlemages were dispatched to Mucianus's last known location, with the intent of bringing him in for questioning.
I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there.
Mucianus Allias. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University.
Aware of the growing interest in the guild after the ban on Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions.
With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently.
I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.
Yes, and we have for quite some time. Though the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power.
The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it.
I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.
Oh... I see. Then it was you that...
In any case, there's no need to meet me again until you've finished... the job. Safer that way. Then I will pay you in full what I promised.
By the Nine! And there was nothing you could do for him?
What a horrible fate. I cannot imagine how they could do that to him. So many lives lost...
I thank you for trying to save him.
Hurry to Nenyond Twill and make sure he is unharmed.
Talk to the beggar! Talk to Bolwing! He knows secrets, but no one can hear them. No one but Big Head.
Take Big Head's charm! Listen to Bolwing! His tongue is tied, but his mind is unraveled! He'll tell you the secret. Who has the Fork?
Information must be paid for in coin, not advice.
Look in the Lonely Suitor Lodge.
You have a short memory, Cat Burglar. Mine needs a little jogging too.
Then why do you waste my time? Jollring! Show him the door, if you please!
Then why do you waste my time? Jollring! Show her the door, if you please!
As you wish. Good day.
My master trusts me to decide what to show him, I'm afraid.
How interesting. I'm sure the curio shops in the Market District would be glad to give you a fair price for this.
Unfortunately, my master is only interested in the rarest and most unique Ayleid artifacts to add to his collection.
I believe my master would be very interested in this item.
However, it is too late to disturb him. If you'll return in the morning, I'm sure he will be glad to speak to you.
I believe my master would be interested in speaking to you right away.
If you'll just follow me.
Really? May I see it, please?
Night among strangers. Secrets in the dark. Nocturnal is here.
But my Eye is blind and drowned, stolen from its shrine, and hid in dark waters.
To steal from a god is most unwise. In Leyawiin, two Argonians think themselves secret, but the Eye has seen them.
Find these thieves in the city that spans the waters. Learn where they hide my Eye.
Retrieve the Eye of Nocturnal, mortal, and return it to me, and I shall look favorably upon you.
My Eye is returned, and I once again see into the darkness that is your world.
We mock the thieves, for bitter is their loss. You, mortal, may take this. It shall open the secrets of dark places for you.
My brother! It is wonderful to see you again. We will have much to talk about in the next days.
All I know is that travelling merchants found me in the wilderness by the body of my mother. I was raised by the monks at Weynon Priory.
We thought you and Mother had both been killed. If we had only known!
I am your twin brother. When we were very small, our farm was attacked by ogres. My ... our father and I escaped.
That can't be. I don't have a brother. I mean, I never knew my real family. Who did you say you were again?
You're not dreaming, Reynald. It's me, your brother. Guilbert.
What? Who ...? Damn, not this again. Wake up! Wake up!!
My god... no!
What? No!
Mistress....
It must bleed.
Darkness.
Kill it.
It must pay.
I'm going to open a tavern. Not that I'd welcome your patronage. No pigs allowed inside, you see. You Legion types tend to stink up a place.
You can call me a barbarian. It's true and I'm proud of the fact. But you call me pathetic again and I'm going to show you just how barbaric I am.
Ha ha ha ha ha! "My kind," as you like to call us, are plenty happy serving our own needs while your useless Empire crumbles down around you!
Bah! Don't get your linens in a bunch. You have no authority in this house, or anywhere else. You're not even in the Legion anymore!
Pfft. I was done with you anyway. I can only talk to an ex-Legion pig for so long before my ears start bleeding. Besides, I need a drink. Ha ha ha!
So, Nord, if you find the gold, what will you spend it on? Wait, let me guess -- a sleazy whore and a nice new battleaxe. Am I right?
A tavern! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I should have known! Leave it to a barbarian to spend an entire chest full of gold on beer and mead. How pathetic.
With every word you speak you're just proving me right, Nord. Your kind has contributed nothing to our Empire, and never will!
Your words border on treason, Nord, and I will not tolerate them! You will respect the Empire! You will respect the memory of our dear Emperor!
Nevertheless, I still serve the Empire in my heart and will not abide such talk! Walk away from me now, barbarian, or you'll regret your arrogance.
You dare challenge the power of Oblivion?
Sir, there's too many of them! We have to fall back!
No! We hold them here.
We can use your help! Let's go!
For the Empire and the Dragon!
That's the last of them! Come on!
Yeah!!
We never even knew what hit us. They were inside the city before we knew what was happening.
Another gate just opened! We'll take the fight to them this time.
To Oblivion!
This way!
It's just up here! Follow me!
What do you think, sir? Hold here or go in?
My orders didn't include leading my men into Oblivion. We'll hold here for now.
You know, that's what I like about you. You're such a good listener. Thanks. I feel so much better now.
I think I'll head down to the basement and get something to eat. I think there's some cheese down there.
Oh, I certainly hope so. I still want to find the gold, of course, but is it even worth it? I just want to go home.
Yes. Yes, this whole thing has taken quite a bit out of me. I think I'll go to my room for a bit and get some sleep. Thanks for the talk.
Yes, well, I know how you feel. What words can really do justice to the terrible situation at hand? But we must stick together if we are to survive!
You... You would do that for me? You are truly a good friend. Yes, I... I fear this is beyond even my ability. I'm not as young as I used to be.
I'll take refuge in my room until Nels has been dealt with. Thank you my friend! And good luck!
Yes! Yes! We must kill that foul Nord before he slits our throats! Aaaaaiiiieee!
Ummm... Okay, then... I guess I'll trying looking down in the basement. Maybe you could search upstairs or something, hmm?
Not much of a talker are you? All right then, I'll give you your space. It's a shame, I thought we could be friends. But you're just so... strange.
I know you're in here. You can't hide forever!
Come out, come out wherever you are...
As you wish. That is a better price than you will get from anyone else. I expect you will reconsider eventually.
Ah! One of the Ten Ancestors! Hold it up to the light ... yes! Exquisite! You did the right thing by bringing this to me.
I am interested in obtaining the complete set of these statues. If you bring them to me when you find them, I will pay you double for each one.
I would be happy to take this statue off your hands right now. I assume that's why you came to see me?
No opinion, huh? Maybe I'll just stay close to him for a bit. You know, hover about and see if he notices me. Maybe then we can talk.
Yeah? You think? Okay, I'll just try to calm down. Calm down, Dovesi, calm down... I'll just take it slow. I can do that. Thanks again, dear friend.
Oh, you think so? I mean, it is rather forward, but I like it! All right then, I'll wait for him in his room upstairs! Oh, thank you, thank you!
Well, thanks for listening. I know I'm just being a silly little girl, but the heart wants what it wants, as they say.
But... but I thought you were my friend? How could you say such a horrible thing? Just leave me alone, you monster!
He... he did? Oh my goodness, what should I do? Should I talk to him? Or maybe play hard to get? Or should I, you know? Or would that be too forward?
I want to go to Fisherman's Rock. Where's that?
I should have told you. It was not your fault. An Orc pays her debts. You helped me, so I forgive you. And thank you, too.
When I saw my friend killed, I swore I'd be a true knight and right all wrongs. So now I gotta do some good deeds.
I don't know much about being a knight. But I'm gonna learn. Say. You did ME a good deed. You oughta be a real knight yourself.
No. You didn't know. It was my fault. But now you know everything. And you helped me, and I won't forget.
Mogens Wind-Shifter! He killed Ra'vindra, my best friend. So I swore a knight's oath of vengeance... and you've spoiled it!
I'm so mad, I could kill you!
You idiot! You ruined everything!
Get moving! I'm right behind you...
Come on! What's the hold-up?
The Argonian says it's north of Leyawiin, about six hours walk, on the east bank of the Niben. Let's get moving.
Big help you are.... All right. Maybe I'll wait here. And maybe not.
This guy, Mogens Wind-Shifter, he camps at Fisherman's Rock. So you take me there, and I talk to him, and then we see what happens.
You hear me? I TALK to him first. No smashing in his teeth or chopping off his head! Understand?
Take me there. Now.
The Argonian said Fisherman's Rock is north of Leyawiin on a point of land on the east shore of the Niben. Take me there. Now.
Are you going to take me to Fisherman's Rock?
Weebam-Na won't take me to Fisherman's Rock. You know where it is?
Then go find him. Tell him I want to see him right now. I'll meet him here.
Go tell him I want to see him right now. I'll meet him here.
Go tell him I want to see him. Here. Right now.
Do you know where Weebam-Na is? I hear he's a hunter, knows all about the woods around here.
You don't know anything about being a knight, so shut up about it.
There's an Argonian named Weebam-Na in town. Go get him for me.
All right, then. There's an Argonian named Weebam-Na in town. Go get him for me.
Go. You're not worth the trouble.
All right, then. Just don't forget I'm a knight.
I'm a FREE knight. I don't have a lord. You got a problem with that?
All right, then. Just don't forget.
You won't say 'Sir' to me? You are afraid to speak. It would shame me to fight a gutless thing like you. So go away.
I'm a knight. So say, 'Sir'. Say, 'Yes, Sir Mazoga'.
I have created a chivalric Order of the White Stallion. Find and kill the leader of the Black Bow Bandits, the Orc named Black Brugo.
If you succeed, I will bestow on both you and Mazoga the titles of Knights-Errant of the White Stallion for your service to Leyawiin.
Such vengeance is a noble deed. Leyawiin thanks you for your service. And I have a fitting reward for such noble deeds.
I address my offer to you and your friend. Would you like to become knights-errant?
Then guide her to Fisherman's Rock. Please.
Then you must persuade him.
Then you will get Weebam-Na for her. The Argonian is a well-known hunter; he has a house in town.
Then I await your report.
I hold you responsible for Mazoga's death. Your disappointing performance proves you are not suited for service to County Leyawiin.
Have you learned why the Orc is here?
Did you find out why the Orc is here?
I need your help. An Orc named Mazoga here claims to be a knight, but will not reveal her business.
Find out why she is here, and report to me, and you will earn a reward suitable for those who serve Leyawiin.
She's got terrible manners. Being her friend may be a lot of work. But my sniffer says she might be worth it.
I see. So an Orc named Mazoga wants to see me? And she expects me to come to her?
I don't know her. I'd be smart to ignore her.
But... I never learned anything by being smart. And you seem to be a right skipper.
So I guess I'll have to go see what this is about. Thank you.
So? An Orc wants to see me? And this interests me how? Did I forget how much I like you so I should do this favor for you?
Maybe I just don't like you very much. So I'm not going.
That's 'Sir Mazoga' to you...
Yes. I'm an Orc. I was born under a rock, and I have no parents. So I don't need a family name.
I guess you don't know how to talk to a knight. So I'll teach you. Say, 'Yes, Sir Mazoga'.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm Mazoga. You killed my friend, Ra'vindra.
No. Who are you?
Then, if you won't tell me why, I won't take you anywhere.
That's my business.
Why?
Take me there. Now. I'm in a hurry.
Fisherman's Rock is north of Leyawiin, about six hours walk, on a point of land on the eastern shore of the Niben.

Greetings, Listener. Come close, and I will share with you the information I have garnered. For someone has prayed to the Night Mother yet again.
Blades! Do homage to Martin's champion!
Stop! Don't let Anaxes out!
No!! Get away from there! If I can just...
Please! No! No!!
No... no... not again...
I deserve it... all of it...
I beg of you... kill the Master... destroy this place...
I hear the war is going badly. There are some new arrivals here that were caught in the fall of the Great Gate.
Smile at your fellow man. Help him when he falls. Remember, these are the times of mirth and cheer. These are the times of Mania!
To be a Maniac is to love and be loved. Spread the compassion and the warmth throughout New Sheoth and beyond.
And finally, we shall raise our goblets to the great Arden-Sul: poet, thespian, author, lover, virtuoso, and artisan extraordinaire.
We shall raise our goblets to the Demented. Though misguided they are, we are all children of Arden-Sul's teachings and therefore equal.
We shall raise our goblets to the great Sheogorath, may he rule the Isles for another thousand years.
Feast until your belly is full, then fill the wine goblets once more and toast our fortune.
Now is a time for indulgence. Partake of the wine and the Greenmote! Cast off your clothing and your inhibitions! Sing and dance until the sun rises!
My good friends, a most jubilant time is once again at hand. The Flame of the Maniacs burns bright, and we must celebrate!
Victory to the Demented!
Our time has come, brethren. The die has been cast, and the Flame of the Demented blazes like the fire in our hearts!
Well done, My Lord. You should have this, as it is one of your artifacts. I don't know why I didn't think to give it to you sooner.
Well done. You should have this, one of the artifacts of the Realm. Perhaps it should have been given to you sooner.
Good work. Good times! Here's a little reward for your efforts. One of my toys. Now, back to business. Before I forget myself.
Good times. Good times. I hope you had as much fun as I did. Here, take this. It's a fun little toy. Now, go away. Before I kill you.
Ah, very good, Sire. your predecessor left everything in place for the final sign. You'll want to head to the center of town. Good day.
Ah, very good. Your predecessor left everything in place for the final sign. You'll want to head to the center of town. Good day.
You've done well, mortal. I'm amused, I think. Head into the center of Border Watch. And make sure to duck.
Your task would be to make the first two signs of the prophecy occur. Your predecessor already put plans in motion for the final step. Good luck.
You are to find a way to make the first two parts of the prophecy come true. I'll take care of the rest, because it's the most fun. Now, run along.
They are a rather superstitious group, living their lives based on omens and prophecy. One such prophecy, the K'sharra, was of particular interest.
They're a superstitious bunch. Everything is an omen or a portent. Let's make one come true. Find their shaman and ask about the K'Sharra prophecy.
There is a settlement called Border Watch that your predecessor found rather dull. This, of course, offended Him greatly.
There's a little settlement called Border Watch. It's a nice, peaceful place... and dull, dull, dull. You're going to make their lives interesting.
Your predecessor did have one task He wanted performed, though He never found a mortal suited for the task.
Time is a strange thing in the Isles, so this may not set us back, and there is a task that needs to be performed.
I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun.
Perhaps I could make you into something useful. Let's find out.
While I believe that you should be attending to your duties, it is, of course, your prerogative to spend time wherever you wish.
Order is at our doorstep, yet you felt it necessary to offer some yarn to... yourself. An interesting choice, to be sure.
This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it.
I could turn you into a goat. Or a puddle. Or a bad idea. I could make you eat your own fingers. Or fall in love with a cloud.
Praying to yourself, my Lord? That's not a good sign. Or perhaps it is. Prince of Madness, and all that.
You, of all people, should realize this is an inopportune time to be in Cyrodiil. Perhaps I've misjudged you.
This hardly seems the time to summon me. Not when Order is busy invading My Realm. Your mortals are just a hoot. I hate hoots.
Mortal! You could have just stopped by to see Me. Would have saved you some lettuce, you know. I believe I'm displeased.
You would summon me? Wait... why are YOU summoning me? You've got things to do. Things I told you to do. This makes me frown.
A mortal? Wait... a mortal I know. MY mortal. What are you doing here, mortal, when I've given you things to do?
Does my Champion summon me? Before I've even told you what to do? That's not very Champion-y. Not at all!
Another mortal dares to summon me, and already I am bored. But enough about me. Let's talk about you.
It's happening! The livestock are dead! The K'Sharra has come to pass! Look to the skies! Look to the skies!
Lift yourself above these follies and meet your foes head-on. Twist a blade in their stomach instead of filling their ears with useless words.
Their answer to life's trials is viewed through the greenish haze of Greenmote and blurred by the taste of spirits.
Trust in Arden-Sul's legitimate teachings. Don't allow the decadent ways of Mania to blind your vision.
Now is the time when we must band together and vanquish those who would pervert our forefather's tenets!
Blasphemy! These words are the pillars upon which the teachings of Arden-Sul stand!
These are words that the Maniacs would have you believe are "sins."
Deceit. Hate. Subterfuge. Malice. Vengeance.
You have a lot of nerve accusing my father of such a heinous crime... and with no proof to back it up?
Please, go away before I lose my temper. I know I'm no match for you in combat, but I don't have to talk to you.
I... I'm at a loss for words.
Already I've heard that the Honorblade rests again in Castle Chorrol and the Escutcheon of Chorrol you have is all the proof I need.
My father had told us that he had hidden something away for us... something to provide for our future, but I never imagined it was this.
I'm sorry you had to be tasked to right this wrong that my father was responsible for. Once again, you've stuck your neck out for us.
Maybe in the past my family was notorious, but never let it be said that the current Jemanes don't pay their dues.
I'd like you to have this keepsake. My father gave it to me when I was but a lad. I think you should have it.
Thanks again, my friend. You are always welcome in our home.
I can't accept what you're implying without some proof of the crime.
I find the fact that my father was a "notorious master criminal" absurd. He was a peaceful farmer, nothing more.
Where you heard this information I'll never know, but please don't mention it again. Accusation without proof is unfounded.
If I was ever rude to you before, I'm sorry. You deserve my gratitude.
My father was a great man! I'll not hear your lies!!
There isn't much to tell you about Albert Jemane. He was one of my best, then he got greedy. The rest is history.
We meet again, mortal, for we have met before, whether you know it or not.
When you mutter in your sleep, you speak to me. When you waken wet with sweat, you've just left my house.
I dwell in your dreams; I savor your nightmares. Now, you will serve me.
The wizard Arkved has the Orb of Vaermina... snatched from the dreams of my followers and dragged into the waking world.
Travel to his tower and retrieve my Orb. Take care, though, mortal. In my Orb, Arkved has found more than he bargained for.
My Orb is returned, and Arkved will live out the rest of his days in nightmare. It is fitting.
You have proved yourself, mortal. It is fitting, as well, that you should bear my token.
I have waited a long time for you, Champion of Old Tamriel.
You are the last gasp of a dying age. You breathe the stale air of false hope.
How little you understand! You cannot stop Lord Dagon.
The walls between our worlds are crumbling. The Mythic Dawn grows nearer with every rift in the firmament.
Soon, very soon, the lines now blurred will be erased. Tamriel and Oblivion rejoined! The Mythic Age reborn!
Lord Dagon shall walk Tamriel again. The world shall be remade. The new age shall rise from the ashes of the old.
My vision shall be realized. Weakness will be purged from the world, and mortal and immortal alike purified in the refiner's fire.
My long duel with the Septims is over, and I have the mastery.
The Emperor is dead. The Amulet of Kings is mine.
And the last defender of the last ragged Septim stands before me, in the heart of my power.
Let us see who at last has proved the stronger!
As a young man, I grew impatient with Mages Guild restrictions, as did many of my fellow apprentices.
We threw ourselves into the riddles of daedric magic. We hungered for forbidden secrets. Knowledge and power were our gods.
You can guess the rest. We got in over our heads. People died. My friends died.
I've put those days behind me. But the bitter wisdom that one has been a fool is not without value.
I put aside the dark arts when I became a priest. But the workings of fate may be seen in this, too.
'The gods can turn anything to good', or so I piously told those who came to see me for advice.
Perhaps I may yet come to believe it myself.
I haven't always been a priest. In my youth, I followed a different path.
I know more than I want to about the seductive power of daedric magic. Let's just leave it at that.
I don't know. Maybe.
I suspect that the secret of how to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise lies within these pages.
But I will need time. Tampering with dark secrets, even just reading them, can be very dangerous. I'll have to proceed carefully.
In the meantime, you should speak to Jauffre. He was concerned about reports of spies in Bruma.
By the Nine! Such a thing is dangerous even to handle!
Forgive me. You were right to bring it. But you'd better give it to me. I know some ways to protect myself from its evil power.
Ah. Good. You should take that to Martin right away.
He'll be in the Great Hall, reading. He's hardly taken time to sleep since you left.
Please tell me you have some good news...
Good choice. I mean, look at the thing! No sane person would go through there. And none have come out, that's for certain.
So, the cat's-paw of the Septims arrives at last.
You didn't think you could take me unawares, here of all places? In the Paradise that I created?
Look now upon my Paradise. Gaiar Alata, in the old tongue. A vision of the past... and the future.
Behold the Savage Garden, where my disciples are tempered for a higher destiny: to rule over Tamriel Reborn.
If you are truly the hero of destiny, as I hope, the Garden will not hold you for long.
Lift your eyes to Carac Agaialor, my seat at the pinnacle of Paradise. I shall await you there.
How little you understand!
The Principalities have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of Oblivion since the First Morning.
Many are their names and the names of their masters: the Coldharbour of Meridia, Peryrite's Quagmire, the ten Moonshadows of Mephala, and...
... and Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan... misnamed 'Tamriel' by deluded mortals.
Yes, you understand now.
Tamriel is just one more Daedric realm of Oblivion, long since lost to its Prince when he was betrayed by those that served him.
Lord Dagon cannot invade Tamriel, his birthright! He comes to liberate the Occupied Lands!
Ask yourself! How is it that mighty gods die, yet the Daedra stand incorruptible?
How is it that the Daedra forthrightly proclaim themselves to man, while the gods cower behind statues and the faithless words of traitor-priests?
It is simple... they are not gods at all.
The truth has been in front of you since first you were born: the Daedra are the true gods of this universe.
Julianos and Dibella and Stendarr are all Lorkhan's betrayers, posing as divinities in a principality that has lost its guiding light.
What are Scholarship, Love, and Mercy when compared to Fate, Night, and Destruction? The gods you worship are trifling shadows of First Causes.
They have tricked you for Ages.
Why do you think your world has always been contested ground, the arena of powers and immortals?
It is Tamriel, the realm of Change, brother to Madness, sister to Deceit.
Your false gods could not entirely rewrite history. Thus you remember tales of Lorkhan, vilified, a dead trickster, whose heart came to Tamriel.
But if a god can die, how does his heart survive?
He is daedroth! TAMRIEL AE DAEDROTH!
This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other. You all remember this. It is in every legend.
Daedra cannot die, so your so-called gods cannot erase him from your minds completely.
Well done, champion! Your progress is swift and sure. Perhaps you will reach me after all.
You think I mock you? Not at all.
In your coming, I hear the footsteps of Fate.
You are the last defender of decadent Tamriel. I am the midwife of the Mythic Dawn, Tamriel Reborn.
I welcome you, if you truly are the agent of Fate.
I tire of the self-styled heroes who set themselves in my path, only to prove unworthy in the event.
Perhaps they have learned the folly of attempting to touch a Daedra Prince. Take this, with my blessing. May it bring you order.
You have returned my followers, mortal. The natural order is restored, and for this, I thank you.
Return to me when you are prepared.
I will transport you to the plane of Oblivion in which they are trapped. Find their souls. When all are collected, I will return you here.
My followers are trapped between worlds; their bodies here on this plane, their souls in Oblivion. I would have you reunite the bodies and the souls.
The fools cast a spell in the hopes of summoning me to them. It was prideful and foolish, and it has had its consequences.
This one moves! A welcome change. So, mortal, you have found my shrine, and you have seen my followers. They are an embarrassment to me.
Did you like that? Pain can be pleasure. You enjoy being in pain, do you? Here, I'm sure you'll enjoy these then.
Martin? He was with the rest of the survivors. They were taken back to the encampment, where it's safer for them.
Martin? He's back there, looking after the other survivors.
I don't know how you got in here, but you're not saving anyone!
No one leaves this Chapel until the Captain gives the all-clear. I have my orders.
Thanks! Thanks a lot!
You've done a great service freeing my Gadeneri. Thank you.
Maybe you can help the others. Watch out for Them.
You've found Gadeneri's skull? Take it to her at the Hill of Suicides! Before They find out you've got it!
It's where you end up if you don't die according to His plan. They will drive you to it. Like They did poor Gadeneri.
I loved her, and then she was gone. By her own hand. It's said any soul on the Hill can be released if their remains are brought to them.
I've heard that those that free the souls become blessed. Can't say for sure. They scatter the remains all over the Isles. Bastards.
Yes, quite an amazing place really. Wonderful for relieving one's tension as you watch those troublesome adventurers suffer... no offence.
I'd say your next move is to head to Xedilian and get it reactivated.
I'd suggest you make haste and get to Xedilian. My Lord Sheogorath does not like those who lollygag. Or maybe He does? Bah! Just get going.
A little busy here! I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Oh, how I love eating. One of my favorite things to do.
Talk to Haskill if you need more information. He's got more brains than a brain pie. Oh... Brain pie! Perfect!
Care to donate?
Yes? Ah... silly me. The book has no pictures. Can't really expect you to read that, now can I?
To reactivate Xedilian for my Lord's pleasure, you'll need to find three Focus Crystals and return them to their resting place.
Each crystal has a matching receptacle called a Judgment Nexus. Even you can't miss them.
Without the crystals in place, the Resonator of Judgment, Xedilian's power source, cannot be restored.
You have the Attenuator, the Manual, and a map. I'm certainly not going to carry you there, so I'd suggest you get to it.
Place one foot in front of the other... you know how it goes.
Awwww.... ain't it cute!
This is supposed to scare us? Ha!
We should just kill this stupid tree and move on.
Okay... this has to be a joke.
Stupid rogue, just when we needed him!
Look at those jewels!
Can't you just wizard it open?
Bah. This place is beginning to bug me!
Only me left... fine. I'll show 'em.
This place is giving me the creeps.
If I find out who's running the show... there'll be hell to pay.
Bring it on... I'm ready.
This can't be right... I got a bad feeling about this place.
We should go back, I'm not sure we should be here.
Can we just leave? I don't like the looks of this place.
That thing may be small but it looks mean. Let's get out of here.
Curious. This one is smaller than the others we've encountered.
I'd stay back, no telling what that thing can do.
What an odd ruin.
I can't help but feel someone is watching us.
If only my arts included open lock spells....
Such riches shouldn't go to waste. We must get in.
Odd statues.
Something isn't right here.
Impossible! This is impossible!
I can't be dead. I just can't be!
No! This is all wrong! This isn't how it's supposed to be!
...huge t-tree... going...going... to k-kill us all...
Nowhere to run.... mad t-tree... must escape...
Going to g-get us... kill us all...
Riches... countless riches! All mine!
Must find the key! Must find the key!
Gold... gems... keys... all mine... find keys...
Well, go on, press one. They won't bite you. At least, I think they won't.
What are you waiting for? Choose a button.
Their fate is in your hands. Choose Mania or Dementia. Either way, they aren't getting out of Xedilian.
In truth, Ciirta is weak. She needs all the able bodies she can get. This is why you are able to walk in here wearing our robes and not be harmed.
Always she wants to strike at Sheogorath. She needs people and she leads them here with lies.
Such a pretty dog. Dead, dead, dead. Ushnar is sad.
I heard from Bernice that Ushnar might get another dog, a new dog. Maybe Ushnar will let me pet him.
Yes, he's dead. It's so sad. I've already made arrangements to get a new one, but I will miss my old friend.
Lord Sheogorath! I apologize for the intrusion, but you must help us! Order has attacked Pinnacle Rock and routed us!
Lord Sheogorath! I apologize for the intrusion, but you must help us! Order has attacked Brellach and routed us!
Well, well! What a turn of events this is! It's new, and I like new, even if it's bad. And this is bad, isn't it? My, my.
Guards, I think Thadon forgot how to use the door. Kindly show him out. Before I forget myself.
I'm speaking with someone. We'll talk later. Or not. When is later, exactly? Not now, I'm sure of that.
Wait! I must speak! Halt! Cease! Desist!
Thadon, how dare you interrupt me! Only I interrupt me. Like just then.
Wait! I must speak! The Ritual must not be completed!
Guards, I think Syl forgot how to use the door. Kindly show her out. Before I forget myself.
Syl! You dare interrupt Me? Only I interrupt Me. Like just then.
Give it here! Give it here!
Take this as payment.
I can taste it already! Sweet, sweet Skooma.
Here, you take this. It's all I got.
YES! Now that's what I'm talking about.
Take this as a token of my thanks.
Shouldn't tease me like that. I hope you trip and fall on a sword.
Don't be so cruel! I hope you die a horrible death.
You don't know what it's like! I need the Skooma!
Sweet, sweet Skooma. Give it here. Give it here!
Quit playing around. Hand it over!
Alright! It's about time. Give it to me already!
I need it. You got it?
Even though I never intend to be a Knight again, that Medallion represents an important part of my past.
It's the only piece of my history that validates who I am.
Anyway, enough of my banter. So, will you please help me get back my Medallion?
Yes, I admit that being a Knight of the Thorn no longer holds any interest for me.
I've found a new kind of comforting inner peace here away from the chaos of Cyrodiil. I'm tired of the battles and the politics.
But most importantly, I've met the woman of my dreams. If I had to leave Zoe, I think I'd be the loneliest man alive.
So you see, everything I want is right here in this beautiful place.
Oh. What a pity. Well, then.
What is it that I can do for you? And be quick about it. Every second that passes brings us closer to our graves.
Oh, yes. You see, I am a student of chronomancy -- the magic of time alteration.
Using magicka, I will slow your heart rate, your breathing, your movement, and your thoughts until they may as well not be functioning at all.
You will be perfectly preserved. Taken out of time. Beautiful forever. I will display you with the rest in my collection.
Oh. Well, do hurry. I'm beginning to feel faint.
Thank you so much again! Here is a small bit of change for your time.
You don't seem to have the bottle with you. Shame on you for lying to a sick woman.
Oh. Well, hopefully I'll still be alive by the time you change your mind.
You're too kind! Here is the empty flask again.
Yeah, whatever. This whole conversation has worn me out. Just stay away from the other Horkvir.
He might offer you the same deal. But that guy is crazy. Trust me.
Too much thinking, not enough work getting done! Fine. You think it over. But stay away from the other me, that Demented Horkvir.
He'll try to offer you the same kind of deal, that handsome devil, but he can't be trusted! Make the right decision.
Good. Just get rid of all those Manics in town, and we'll all be happier. Don't kill any Demented, though, or no reward for you.
Good. A little hard work will do you some good. Just get rid of those Demented freaks, and we'll all be happier.
And stay away from us Manics! You kill any of us by accident, you won't be getting anything from me.
Only one group can stick around. Either we Demented or those blasted Manics. It's the only way we'll find any peace.
You get rid of those Manics. All of them. If you can take care of that for me, I'd make it worth your while.
Get rid of that Demented bunch. Useless, anyway. Don't get a lick of work done around this town.
If you get rid of them, I'll make it worth your while.
Some blasted mage. Had a theory. They've always got theories. He thought there was a Manic and a Demented in each of us.
So, what does he do? What else? Casts a spell. You can see how well that went. Two of each of us walking around this place.
Nothing we can do about it, either. There's a law about that here. Been to the Hill of Suicides? Not a nice place. But you might be able to help.
A wizard did it. Stupid layabout mage. Had a theory about each of us having a Manic and Demented side.
He decided to test the theory. Cast a spell. Split us all in two. Do we get twice the work done? No! Ridiculous.
We're not allowed to take care of it either. There are rules. And I don't want to end up on the Hill of Suicides. You, on the other hand....
Very good! Now begins your true journey! We will soon become very intimate, you and I! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Before I send you away, however, I would like to present you with a rather special reward.
I see you still possess the Blade of Woe, the weapon given to you by Lucien Lachance when you first met. Allow me now to unlock its true power!
Yes, you will now find the Blade of Woe a bit more... potent than it was. Now go. Leave this crypt, and serve our Dread Father til your dying breath!
Very well. Take your time. Enjoy the hospitalities of my... home. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Silent even as Listener? Good. For now is the time to meditate upon all that has transpired. And please, help yourself to this crypt's treasures.
When you are ready, speak with me again, and I will deliver you safely to the only place you can truly call home -- the Cheydinhal Sanctuary!
There is much work to be done. When you return to the Sanctuary, speak with Arquen. She will serve as your humble servant and guide.
You will get what you desire. But first, meditate upon all that has transpired. Perhaps you covet treasure? Take all my crypt has to offer!
Go. Take a few moments to collect yourself. Meditate upon all that has transpired. Help yourself to any treasures this crypt may offer.
There is much work to be done. When you are back in the Sanctuary, speak with Arquen. She will serve as your humble servant and guide.
Our Dread Father foresaw your defeat of the traitor, here in this very crypt! You have been chosen! You are to be my new Listener!
You possess strength, and cunning, and a heart as black as midnight. You were marked by Sithis the moment you emerged from your mother's womb.
Yes, dear child! Yes! The Dread Father foresaw it all! You were meant to kill the traitor! You were meant to be named Listener of the Black Hand!
Don't you see? Our Dread Father foresaw your defeat of the traitor, here in this very crypt! You have been chosen! You are to be my new Listener!
Ah, so you choose to play the stoic, hmm? You remain silent even when faced with my terrible countenance? Your silent obedience is to be commended.
If only my other children had offered such reverence. You see, I have known of Mathieu Bellamont's intentions since he was just a boy.
I knew of his thirst for vengeance. I could have informed my Listener. But I refused! Refused to reward such incompetence! Ungolim was weak.
Indeed, I allowed Mathieu Bellamont to proceed on his destructive course. Just as I allowed you to intercept him.
So you did, my child. So you did! Ha ha ha ha ha! You obeyed your orders and showed no mercy or remorse. How could I ask for a better servant?
If only my other children had served me so well! You see, I have known of Mathieu Bellamont's intentions since he was just a boy.
I know, dear child. I know. You carried out your orders to the letter, in the name of the Black Hand. How could I be anything but happy with you?
No, my anger lies with the rest of my children. You see, I have known of Mathieu Bellamont's intentions since he was just a boy.
So, she's dead, eh? Hahaha. Finally! Finally someone has wiped that stupid smug grin off her face. Good, good.
I suppose you expect some sort of a reward? I don't think so. I have some gold tucked away, but we never struck a bargain.
If I were you, after you're released, I'd get out of Bruma fast before the guards catch on that they let a murderer free.
Here is your reward. And this other Black Bow? Would you like to turn it in as well?
Here is your reward. Well done, and thank you.
Very well. You may bring it to me at any time and receive your reward.
I created the Order of the White Stallion to honor free adventurers who perform noteworthy services for County Leyawiin.
I have dedicated our royal hunting retreat, the White Stallion Lodge, to the exclusive use of White Stallion Knights.
The lodge lies a short distance north of Leyawiin, on the west bank of the Niben.
At sunrise, the view across the water is quite picturesque.
I see you have a Black Bow. Would you like to turn it in for the bounty?
Each Black Bow you bring me means another Black Bow Bandit slain.
Justice has been done. And henceforth, you shall be known as Knight of the White Stallion.
May I present you with the perquisites of your rank... a key to White Stallion Lodge and a shield bearing the arms of County Leyawiin.
And I promise you a bounty of 100 gold for each Black Bow you bring me.
Justice has been done. And henceforth, Mazoga and you shall be known as Knights of the White Stallion.
Mazoga's key and shield shall be delivered to her directly. And I promise you a bounty of 100 gold for each Black Bow you bring me.
Then it is only a matter of time? I await your report.
Then you'll be eager to be on your way. I won't keep you....
In her shadowy past, your friend Mazoga might have had contacts with outlaws. Ask her.
What news do you have of Black Brugo?
The outlaw, Black Brugo, is a menace to County Leyawiin. They call his marauders 'Black Bow Bandits' because they use black bows.
Find Black Brugo, and execute him for his crimes, and I will make both you and your friend Mazoga Knights-Errant of the White Stallion.
I told you all I'm going to tell you. You want Brugo, you're on your own.
Expect Brugo and his boys in Telepe, Middas, after midnight.
I know Brugo. Long ago, back before I became 'Sir Mazoga', I split a share or two with Brugo.
So. You killed Black Brugo. Well, the bastard had it coming, I guess. You get a reward?
So? Am I a knight?
Suit yourself. Enjoy your stay.
You're gonna end up rotting here anyway, you idiot.
You've got nothing to lose. So why not just tell me and save us both a heap of trouble?
Look, you horse's ass. I've never trusted city guardsmen. Never. So I'm definitely not going to start trusting you, Tyrellius.
Yeah, sure. And I suppose I just end up rotting while you spend it all? Forget it.
Quick! He may need our help!
We should check the Chapel. Come on!
We can't open that gate from out here. The only mechanism for raising it is inside the gatehouse.
And the only way to get into the gatehouse now would be through the passage at the North Guard House. But that's always kept locked.
Hurry and find Berich Inian. He should be back in the Chapel, and should still have the key to the Guard House.
Once you've got it, get to the Guard House, find the passage, and open that gate. Then we can get inside the castle and secure it.
Yeah. Well. Maybe you're right. A real knight shouldn't act like a jerk to his pals.
So, thank you. You've been good to me. And I won't ever forget it.
So I better get started doing my good deeds. And maybe I'll see you at the White Stallion Lodge.
Thank you kindly, Sir Knight. Sounds good. Damn good.
I'm a Knight-Errant now, and I don't care who knows it.
So, thank you. You been good to me. And I won't ever forget it.
So I better get started doing my good deeds. And maybe I'll see you at the White Stallion Lodge?
Thank you kindly! 'Knight of the White Stallion.' Sounds good. Damn good.
God's goolies! Not just a Knight, but a... Knight-Errant! That's a real special kind of Knight, right?
So? Go on... say it! Say... 'I greet you, Sir Mazoga.'
Well. That's nice. I set Brugo up for you, and you get the reward?
Congratulations, you manky scroat. Now get away from me. And don't ever talk to me again.
Really? That's not what I heard. I heard you got made into a knight.
Yeah? Well, good luck. Let me know how it comes out.
You're the boss. Whenever you're ready....
I'm ready when you are...
You're the boss.
Brugo's a jerk. He's got a hideout in a ruin called Telepe. Every night, between midnight and six AM, he stops there to pick up his take.
We're pals, right? So we'll kill Black Brugo and be knights! I'll wait right here until you ask me to follow you.
Will no-one help a poor beggar?
She's in the Lonely Suitor Lodge for her noon meal. That much I'm sure of.
She's in all the usual places. I'll need a donation to refresh my memory.
The Greymarch continues, and Lord Sheogorath believes you may be the key to stopping it. Do as he commands. The Realm depends on it.
Your job is still to stop it. And to stop Jyggalag. You've already forced Order's hand.
No stopping now. Some things can't be stopped. Trust me. I've tried.
I understand my Lord has told you what is to come. It is one of the Great Mysteries of the Shivering Isles.
Perhaps only the Princes themselves know why it is so. I do not. I know only that Sheogorath wishes for you to succeed. Of this, I am certain.
Cat's out of the bag on that one, isn't it? Who puts cats in bags, anyway? Cats hate bags.
Soon, I'll turn into Jyggalag. There's no stopping it. That doesn't excuse you from your duties, though. Get to it.
Now? Nothing has changed! You deal with this messenger. Make sure my army is secure. You'll need them.
Stop it? Oh, no. Can't do it. Believe me, I've tried. It never ends well.
But you're still going to stop the Greymarch. Stop Jyggalag... Me... from destroying My Realm.
Soon. Too soon. I can already feel the change beginning. I feel like I'm not quite here. I'm not over there yet, but I'm not quite here.
And I've been having moments of clarity that are quite unlike me. Like now.
Aren't you precious? Do you really not know? Haven't you noodled it all through yet?
Because He is Me! I'm Him! We're a bit of each other, really. I won't be here when He arrives, because I'll be Him.
Happens every time. The Greymarch starts, Order appears, and I become Jyggalag and wipe out My whole Realm.
His appearance seems imminent. His hatred for this land, for what it represents, is unimaginable.
He's almost here. I can feel it. You won't like Him as much as Me. He doesn't even carry a cane! More the giant, bone-cleaving sword type of Prince.
If he's on his way, I'm on My way out. I already feel not quite Myself. Not quite someone else... but not quite Myself.
It appears to be inevitable, though your victory in the Fringe is a new twist. I fear Sheogorath will be gone soon, however.
It's all moving faster than I'd expect. And I'm good at expecting. Things are getting a bit thin.
Get that Gatekeeper in place, and do it quickly. I'm not sure how much time I have left.
He was right about that. I can feel it. In My bones. The little ones.
The Greymarch has swept the Fringe. Order gathers its forces there as we speak. And I hate when people gather forces in My Fringe.
You'll need to put an end to that. Stop them. My armies should already be there, but I want you to see what you can do to help.
If they continue to marshal their forces there, we won't be able to contain them. Make sure they can't.
She was right about that. I can feel it. In My bones. The little ones.
In the Fringe, you can see for yourself the devastation that accompanies the Greymarch. Let us hope you are up to the task of stopping it.
It's swept the Fringe. That's not good. See if you can't hold them off there. Because, if you can't, everyone is going to die.
No pressure.
Soon, Jyggalag will come to this Realm, bringing destruction in his wake. With the Throne of Madness empty, the Realm is doomed. Lovely.
I fear it won't be long until he makes his presence known. Without Sheogorath on His throne, the Realm is likely doomed. Again.
He'll be here soon, and I'll be gone. Can't say I like the sound of that. I like the sound of other things, though. Like birds. And bones cracking.
This time, I'll beat him. I can't stand losing. And I don't mind cheating.
You'll see the miasma begin to spread. Where Order appears, the Realm dies. I only hope you are up to Sheogorath's task.
He believes that by you ruling either Mania or Dementia, you'll be able to effectively inspire his people and lead His forces. I hope He's right.
It seems our Lord believes you are the key to stopping it. Perhaps He's right. He's had worse ideas. Did he tell you about the clowns? What a mess.
He wishes you to gain the respect of the people, to be a leader once He is gone. It is an interesting concept.
It'll be in full swing soon! Excited?
You shouldn't be. It's the death of all things.
But, if we can get you into shape, we might stand a chance. You'll lead My forces, inspire My people! Hopefully, everyone won't end up dead.
It's already started, but you might be able to stop it. We're making you into a leader the people can trust. Someone to look up to. Someone to blame!
Once I'm gone, things usually get bad quickly. Lots of defections. Lots of carnage. But with you at the helm, things will be different!
A bad lot. Traitors. You'll find them near the obelisks that dot the land. They perform rituals at the obelisks to summon Knights to the Realm.
Their link to Jyggalag gives them power. As long as their obelisk is active, they cannot truly be killed.
They're the worst of all. My own subjects, working for the Enemy! It's enough to make an old Daedric Prince get all weepy.
It doesn't help that they're the ones who make the obelisks work. A little chanting, a little ritual, and POOF! Knights of Order. Bad news.
Kill them when you see them. But don't touch the corpse until they're really dead. Which they aren't, until you deactivate the obelisk.
Yes, he will soon march across the land, destroying all that stands in his path. It's a frightening prospect.
Many of our citizens are... delicate. They can't cope with the prospect, and they defect to the forces of Jyggalag, becoming Priests of Order.
He's on his way, so I'm on my way out. It's terribly inconvenient, don't you think?
You're going to stop him, though. And the first thing to do is to make my people feel safe. Otherwise, they tend to go work for him.
It's annoying, to tell the truth. A bit hurtful. But they do it every time. Join up with the enemy, and become Priests of Order.
I fear they grow in power as the Greymarch progresses. More and more Knights of Order make their way into the Isles.
The Priests of Order are the key. They summon the Knights at the obelisks.
They're getting more active every day. Not a good sign.
You know what would be a good sign? "Free Sweetrolls!" Who wouldn't like that?
Shut them down where you can. And make sure to kill the Priests you see around them. If you don't, they can reactivate the obelisk.
It is underway, but my Lord does not wish for you to confront it directly yet. First, the Realm and its citizens must be attended to.
Aren't you the curious one? You know what they say about curiosity, though, don't you?
It killed the intrepid adventurer who really should just be doing exactly what I say at all times.
You're going to stop the Greymarch by becoming Me. Or a version of Me. You'll be powerful. Powerful enough to stop Jyggalag.
Ah, the Great Torch. It is a symbol of Sheogorath's power and a source of great comfort for the citizens of New Sheoth.
Unfortunately, the Torch has gone out. For eternity, this has heralded the start of the Greymarch.
Lord Sheogorath, in His wisdom, wishes for you to relight the Torch, to help ease the worries of the populace.
The Great Torch shines brightly above New Sheoth, a beacon of hope for all the citizens.
Except it doesn't! It's gone out. Happens every time the Greymarch begins. Which it has.
Makes all of my subjects uneasy. Tense. Homicidal. Some of them, at least. We need to get that Torch relit, before the place falls apart.
As my Lord told you, it happens at the end of every era, and Jyggalag walks the Realm.
Few of the citizens can remember the last Greymarch. Or they choose not to.
It's Jyggalag's time, and not a good time at all. You're going to help me stop it. First, though, you need to get your feet wet.
I can't expect you to save the place if you don't even understand it. So, speak to my Dukes. Learn about Mania and Dementia. Try not to die.
The Daedric Prince of Order, and the leader of the Greymarch. As I'm sure my Lord told you, Jyggalag has always been a threat to this Realm.
Another Daedric Prince. Not a nice one. I don't think ANY of the other Princes like him, actually. I mean, Malacath is more popular at parties.
And Malacath is NOT popular at parties.
Yes, you'll find them throughout the Isles. Jyggalag's forces use them as conduits into the Isles.
Sheogorath has tried to remove them, but they always return. While they cannot be destroyed, they can be rendered inert.
The Hearts of Order found on Jyggalag's Knights can be placed in the obelisks. Adding enough can cause the obelisk to become overloaded with power.
Seen them about, have you? Odd things. They've always been here, but they're not OF here, if you take my meaning.
You'll see those Knights of Order around them during the Greymarch. Drawn to them, like flies to honey. Or rotting flesh.
Ever wonder why flies like both? Best not to ask.
Really, no need to trouble yourself with the details of that now. It would just cloud your little mind.
What is important is getting to Xedilian. Quickly. Before I get bored. You wouldn't like me when I'm bored.
You of course recall Rufio, the feeble old man I sent you to kill when we first met? He was weak in life, but his spirit is quite angry in death.
The scroll will allow you to call upon Rufio's angry ghost for assistance. He will appear, unleash his anger upon your foes, and then disperse.
The apple has been treated with a most deadly poison. It will likely kill whomever eats it, probably instantly.
To use the apple, simply dispose of any other food and put the apple in its place. If someone is inclined to eat, and they taste the apple... death.
I took the other one, and that should've been enough. I shouldn't have to go through all this, just to get rid of her!
It's not even as if I was going to keep it forever. I was going to give it back to her, once I'd gotten what I wanted. That's not so wrong, is it?
Once she helped me advance out of that place, and stepped down, then she could have it back! Why did you have to get in the way?
Why are you trying to ruin everything?
What, you think I didn't know what you're up to? I knew you were looking for it. I knew you'd find it, and I had to stop you. Now hand it over.
There, there, my dear. Everything will be just fine. Don't worry.
Don't fret, my love... I'm here. Be happy.
Words like that make me happy to be here with you.
Your words warm my heart, my love. Being here is the best choice I've made in my life.
No, Zoe. I don't. Everything I want is right here with you.
And I feel the same. I am the happiest man in the Isles and all Cyrodiil.
You make me so happy, Pyke. I will stop my other portraits and paint a picture of this moment to capture it in time.
We shall celebrate our love tonight, my darling.
No. I still can't decide what to paint today. The trees? The sky? It's all so complicated!
Not really. I was all set to paint the waters of the coast and I'm all out of azure.
Yes, love. With you here, everything will be fine.
Yes, my love. I am ready to begin another day anew with you. That's all I need.
Secure it at once! It's the only thing we have left!
At least this is safe. Thank you; I shall make sure it is protected, for the time when a new Count is crowned.
Here, take this. I have no use for it; I'm tired of fighting. It may serve you well in days to come.
How dare you mock him, even in death!
Had you not been instrumental in getting this far, I'd put you down where you stand.
Where is the Count's ring? Do you have it?
We... we were too late?
If only we'd gotten here sooner!
This is indeed a dark day for all of us left. But I thank you for risking your own life to help us.
Did you find the Count's ring, by any chance?
Could be. You know how it is. But not until I'm finished talking!
Sigh. How many times do I have to tell you? No proof, no accusation!
I don't know. It's strange... I think you might actually be telling the truth.
What does this mean? What do you want from me?
The strange thing is, I think you might actually be telling the truth.
If you had come to me before... I would have laughed and dismissed you out of hand.
Now... with the daedra invading our world, Kvatch in ruins, the Emperor and his sons assassinated... anything seems possible.
Perhaps you were sent by Akatosh. Perhaps not. But I of all people should know that the gods work through us, not for us.
You spoke to the Emperor before he died? And he told you to find me?
Of course I'm in danger. But I'm needed here. I can't leave.
I assume you didn't risk your own life to come here to tell me something I already know. Who are you and what do you want?
Danger, you say? You came here to tell me this?
Explain yourself or leave me alone. There are many others here who actually need your help.
His meaning is unclear to me as well. The Emperor seemed to perceive some threat from the demonic world of Oblivion.
The Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, is one of the lords of Oblivion.
But the mortal world is protected from the daedra of Oblivion by magical barriers.
The Prince of Destruction he referred to is none other than Mehrunes Dagon, one of the lords of the demonic world of Oblivion.
The Emperor's words-- "Close shut the jaws of Oblivion"-- certainly suggest that he perceived some threat from Oblivion.
But all the scholars agree that the mortal world is protected from the daedra of Oblivion by magical barriers.
You brought me the Amulet of Kings? This cannot be. Let me see it.
You'd better explain yourself. Now.
Emperor Uriel? Do you know something about his death?
This cannot be. No one but the Emperor is permitted to handle the Amulet. Let me see it.
The Count? Then I can talk to you. I'm Mazoga.
Then go away.
You're a liar. You don't even look like a Count.
You're a liar. The Count is a man. And you aren't a man.
Only those who break the law.
I'll take my chances in prison rather than fight you. Someday I'll get out and the weasel that turned me in will pay!
Good people of the Imperial City, welcome to the Arena! You've come to watch the Grand Champion battle some of Cyrodiil's fiercest creatures!
Who will survive this week's epic battle of combatant versus beast? Let's find out! Lower the gates!
Good people, the Grand Champion is victorious! Esteemed Grand Champion, leave the Arena now and rest! You've earned it once again!
Well of course he'd say that! He'd do anything to save his skin!
Please, don't let him deceive you. You must return there and put an end to his masquerade. Quickly, before he has a chance to get away!
That bastard! Seridur dares accuse me of being a vampire? Me?! Ha! He's the one who is the vampire!
Look, I assure you, this is of the utmost importance. Together, we may be able to save the lives of many innocents. I implore you to follow.
You hold the staff, but you are no Daedric Prince!
This ends as it always does. Order shall reign!
Another of Sheogorath's foolish schemes!
Your staff does not make you a Daedra, foolish mortal.
You wear the trappings, but you are not the Madgod!
This is what the Madgod sends against me?
Order shall rule this world once more!
Jyggalag walks once more!
The Lord of Order shall rule this Realm!
Are you the best the Madgod could muster?
Bow before the power of Order!
Kneel before the might of Jyggalag!
Once again, Jyggalag walks!
The Greymarch is upon you!
A mortal to stand before Jyggalag? Fool!
The Realm of Madness is mine!
A mortal faces me?
Shadow of a god!
Break before the March of Order!
Foolish mortal!
Die, pretender!
Oh... I see. Well, if you change your mind, come see me and I can fill you in on the details. Please, reconsider soon... I'm worried about him.
Normally, I wouldn't approach a total stranger like this, but Gilen seemed so insistent. Please, forgive my audacity...
Where are my manners? I'm Ralsa Norvalo. My husband, Gilen, has requested that I find you and ask if you'd assist him.
Has the Council gone mad, sending you here alone?
There's no time. The others... they were waiting for us. They knew we were coming!
I'm the only one left. The Necromancers retreated further in, but we've got to follow them. There's no time to waste!
Fithragaer. Battlemage. Sent by the Council to find this traitor....
He must've told them we were coming! We've got to get our hands on him, before he tells them anything else!
Who the blazes are you, anyway?
Yes. Of course! Anything to help.
I really know very little. They contacted me. I suppose they learned that I was looking for the third and fourth volumes.
I've never actually met any of them, I swear!
You can only get Volume 4 directly from a member of the Mythic Dawn. I had set up a meeting with the Sponsor, as he called himself.
Here, take this note they gave me. It tells you where to go. I don't want anything else to do with the Mythic Dawn.
Yes. Of course! I don't want anyone to think I had anything to do with their insane plots!
Here. Volume 3 is yours. What you do with it is your business.
What?! The Mythic Dawn were the ones...?
You have to believe me! I truly had no idea. I mean, I knew they were a daedric cult.
Mankar Camoran's views on Mehrunes Dagon are fascinating, revolutionary even...
But to murder the Emperor... Mara preserve us!
I never said anything about the Mythic Dawn. In fact, I don't even know what you're talking about.
I beg your pardon? You presume to tell me about daedric cults?
I'll have you know that I've visited the Shrine of Sheogorath during the Festival of the Mad!
I've spoken with Hermaeus Mora beneath the full moons! I've...
Oh, really? You think the Mythic Dawn is the first daedric cult I've encountered?
Of course I'm proud to do my duty. But... It's a waste of time. What are we guarding? Cold stone and shadow. That's it.
That's exactly what I'm saying! But will the Captain listen? Noooo... "We must have a presence!" "The prison must remain secure!"
Yeah, well, I guess you can't blame Captain Montrose too much. This is his big career move, after all. Got to impress that lot upstairs.
Oh, I'll be there! How could I miss a chance to see you cower before that big Orc bouncer? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm not disagreeing with you, believe me. Those assassins got what they wanted. The Emperor is dead. They've got not reason to come back.
Yeah, what a laugh, huh? Just who are we keeping secure? Dreth? Since that other one got away, he's the only one rotting down here.
Yeah, true enough. Ah, well, I best be getting back to my watch. Hey, don't forget, we're meeting for drinks later at the Bloated Float.
Pfft! I ain't afraid of no one. Courage is my middle name! I... Oh, nevermind.
Of course you can't! Nobody ever wants to help! That's the... Wait... Did you actually say you'd help me?
Oh, how wonderful! I can't thank you enough! I've been going out of my mind ever since my crew was murdered!
This is my ship, you see. The Serpent's Wake. I hired the crew to sail to Summerset Isle to retrieve a family heirloom, my mother's crystal ball.
They made the journey, and arrived back all right, but then... Someone murdered them! All of them! Now their spirits are haunting the ship!
The crystal ball is in a chest in the ship's hold, but I can't get to it. I made it as far as the captain's cabin, but the spirits nearly killed me!
Get the crystal ball and return it to me here, and I'll make it worth your trouble. Here, you'll need this key. Thank you so much!
Of course you can't! Nobody ever wants to help! That's what's wrong with the world these days. Everybody's so damned selfish!
Wrong, fool. I've grown tired of this guessing game. I've much to do and you're in the way. I aim to rectify that!
What? Can no one in this gang keep things secret?
I suppose you think you know why we've taken over the Bloated Float as well!
The Countess is in attendance. Please observe proper etiquette.
The Countess is in attendance from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening each day.
If you wish to seek audience with her, please return at that time. You're also welcome to wait anywhere in the Great Hall. Good day.
Look, there's no need to be rude. I just thought it might have been interesting to you.
I beg to differ, history can be quite enriching. Hmph. I figured you to have more brains than brawn, but so be it.
You must be joking, right? Who hasn't heard of the greatest known hero of the First Age?
Reman Cyrodiil not only was the conqueror of the Akaviri forces, but he actually convinced them to help build the Empire as it is today.
With such an Empire at his disposal, he conquered most of Tamriel, except Morrowind of course, and was crowned Emperor.
In fact, he instituted the rites of becoming an Emperor, which included the construction of the Amulet of Kings.
His alliance with Lord Vivec during the Akaviri invasion is just one example of his cunning and ingenuity.
Countess Carvain's collection of Akaviri Artifacts is known far and wide as one of the most complete. It's unsurpassed even by museum standards.
I've heard that she's troubled by a particular piece that continues to elude her. However, I'm unsure of what it is, as she keeps it a secret.
Her steward, Tolgan, occasionally approaches individuals the Countess feels is worthy enough to seek her prize.
If you're interested in assisting the Countess, you can always seek out Tolgan. He's usually in the Castle.
No one goes through this door unless under the Captain's orders.
Captain Matius sent us in to try and close the gate. We were ambushed, trapped, and picked off.
I managed to escape, but the others are strewn across that bridge. They took Menien off to the big tower. You've got to save him!
You want to help? You're kidding, right?
Hmm... if you're serious, maybe I can put you to use. It'll likely mean your death, though.
The only thing we can do.
We'll try to hold our ground, that's what. If we can't hold this barricade, those beasts could march right down and overrun the encampment.
I have to try and protect the few civilians that are left. It's all I can do now.
We lost the damned city, that's what happened!
It was too much, too fast. We were overwhelmed. Couldn't even get everyone out. There are still people trapped in there.
Some made it into the Chapel, but others were just run down in the streets. The Count and his men are still holed up in the castle.
And now we can't even get back into the city to help them, with that damned Oblivion Gate blocking the way.
I can bring her around for a short time. You must be quick.
What? Janus... please, no. Let me sleep. Please, let me sleep.
It's all right... it's all right. I've come to give you peace at last.
I can... rest? Truly?
Yes, my dear. Just drink this, and it will all be better.
Oh, Janus. Thank you... thank you for saving me.
Rona, my dear, it's time to wake up.
I see. Please find me when you do. The Count is eager to receive it.
Yes, it seems that you do. The Count will be pleased.
Please, follow me.
You do not have the cure. Please do not attempt to deceive me.
Return when you possess a cure. Then I shall take you to the Count.
The three of you should be prepared by now, but as you see we have a new recruit with us as well. I'll need a word with you, recruit.
Apparently, they've been giving the locals some trouble. Shouldn't be a problem for you four, though.
The four of you have a mission. The settlement of Water's Edge has contracted us to take care of some goblins in the area.
Fine. You don't scare me. Beat me, torture me. I'll never talk to you.
Nothing more! I choose death!  Long live the Blackwood Company!
Never! I would rather die! I will tell you nothing!
Forgive me, my master.... It is Ri'Zikar! He leads us! And he will have your head. He will kill you all!
No! I will not betray him! I will not tell you!
I don't like the way he's poking around.
I don't like the way she's poking around.
Better keep an eye on him.
Better keep an eye on her.
The Brethren won't like it.
The land is good, the farm productive. But it's mining the wealth from beneath the land that will make my fortune.
The land is good, the farm productive. The mine's under construction, but once it's working, it will make my fortune.
Drad purchased the land and title from Council. It cost him a fortune, and he's determined to make it pay.
The Azura coven in the Jeralls north of Cheydinhal... nice folks. Nothing like the blood-drinking Daedra worshippers everyone raves about.
A waste of time, of course, worshipping gods in the first place. But at least they're not raving lunatics.
You mean the shrine to Nocturnal? That's north of Leyawiin, east of the Lower Niben.
I can think of three. The Hircine shrine is south of town, northeast of Bravil, between the Upper Niben and the Green Road.
The Mephala shrine is northeast of the junction of the Red Ring Road and the Silver Road.
I've heard there's a Vaermina shrine at the headwaters of the Reed River, though I've never been there myself.
Yes, in fact, up in the Imperial Reserve, a long way north-north-west of Skingrad, I came upon a Sanguine shrine.
Gave it a wide berth. I'm a goblin hunter. Don't want to tangle with those Daedra worshippers.
I saw a big statue of Malacath, west of Fort Sutch, west of the Gold Road to Hammerfell. Looked like Daedra worshippers to me.
A shrine to Azura lies in the Jerall Mountains, far to the north, towards the Skyrim border.
And I think there's a shrine to Boethia high in the Valus Mountains southeast of Cheydinhal.
There's a Malacath shrine west of Fort Sutch, west of the Gold Road to Hammerfell. But I stay away. I like my skin on the outside, in one piece.
What makes you think I'd know anything about that...
... But it just so happens I've run into some Sanguine worshippers up in the Imperial Reserve, a long way north-north-west of Skingrad.
Can't give you any better directions, unfortunately. Traveled mostly at night with a guide, and didn't see much on the way.
Daedra cults aren't necessarily evil, of course. In nearby Morrowind, for example, they worship Daedra in the Temple.
The Azura shrine north of town, up Lake Arrius way, for instance. I know a Dark Elf there. Nothing evil about him.
We serve the retired Moth priests from the Imperial City. The work they do leads to progressive blindess.
They live in utter darkness in the secret catacombs. Of course it doesn't affect them because they are blind.
I don't understand what you mean. We can see just fine.
Okay, okay, I'll show you. But only because you are my dear friend. Follow me.
Please be discreet and don't bother the other monks.
I can't reveal that! It would be far to dangerous. I don't know you that well.
This one hopes the hunter enjoys the cage.
It's your prison sentence, not mine.
It will be done. I will shred all of the hunter's criminal warrants.
Consider it done. I will get rid of all your criminal warrants.
Armand Christophe and S'krivva have special arrangements with the guards and judges throughout Cyrodiil.
They can make all your outstanding warrants go away, for only half the price of the fines.
The hunter can pay his fines to the guards, serve his time, or pay this one half and they will all go away.
You can pay your fines to the guards, serve your time, or pay me half and I'll fix them all.
The letter is currently in steward Dairihill's desk. She has lied to Lady Umbranox, telling her that the letter has yet to arrive.
Countess Umbranox of Anvil, is hunting for a new captain of her guard. The Legion Commander of the Imperial Watch sent her a list of candidates.
The Gray Fox wants this list replaced with one that highly recommends Hieronymus Lex. From Anvil he can do little harm to the guild.
Smart move. I hold the power in this castle. Don't forget it. Here is a small token of my esteem.
You insolent... do you know who I am? I'll see that Countess Umbranox knows what kind of a fetcher you are!
You have the Imperial Watch recommendation for my new guard captain?
Normally these missives are handled by my steward, Dairihill. Let me see that.
Hmmm. Hieronymus Lex looks like the best choice. I was about to give the position to Dairihill's cousin.
I have the orders right there. I'll fill in his name and you can deliver it to Captain Lex. Thank you courier. My steward will tip you.
This matter will have to wait. I hold court in the great hall in the morning.
I've been reassigned! This is outrageous! The Gray Fox had a hand in this, I know it.
I am bound by duty and honor to obey this order. After all these years, he has finally won.
Maybe fate will be kind and deliver him to me in Anvil.
You what! But I didn't... I mean, of course. I'll take that letter now. I'll personally make sure that Lady Umbranox gets it.
She wants me to tip you! You add insult to injury. You cost my cousin a chance at that job. Take your money and get out of my sight!
Yes. My cousin is in line to take up the position. He is eminently qualified.
Looking for the steward, are you? Her office is in the private chambers. But she's not there much.
You can find her in the audience chamber in the mornings. She dines with the Countess from evening's eighth bell until midnight.
To be honest, I couldn't give you directions to any special room in the castle. Anyone in the castle can tell you though.
However, I'll tell you for free that there are many secrets in that Castle. There are secret ways, and secret people. Find the blacksmith.
I hope your feet are faster than your wits.
Does the Lonely Suitor Lodge sound familiar? Try there.
Your poor memory is my good fortune. What's it worth to ya?
Please, my friend. I need your judgement, not your obedience.
I explain myself to you so you understand me. And so you can explain to the Countess.
I'm afraid she may take a bit more convincing than you.
Remember when we first met in Kvatch? I told you that I didn't want any part of the gods' plan.
I still don't know if there is a divine plan. But I've come to realize that it doesn't matter.
What matters is that we act. That we do what's right, when confronted with evil.
That's what you did at Kvatch. It wasn't the gods that saved us, it was you.
Were you acting for the gods? I don't know. But now it's my turn to act.
No. I'll lead the defense of Bruma myself. If I am to be Emperor, it's time I started acting like one.
Of course, dear Listener! I am with you!
Y... Yes dear Listener! I... I will wait in the Sanctuary until you have further need of me!
Of course, Listener! I will remain here until you say otherwise!
Of course, great Listener! Your word is law!
Yes, honored Listener! I shall become shadow!
May... May Sithis keep you safe, most revered Listener. If you ever need my help, you need only ask!
Oh! It... It seems you already have a family member traveling with you, dear Listener. Perhaps I can help, when you are done with their services?
Yes, most revered Listener! My spells will serve Sithis until I lie cold and dead!
Yes, most revered Listener! My bow is yours!
Yes, most revered Listener! My blade will rend flesh at your command!
Alas for the honor of Valenwood, the Wood Elf has fallen.
In the scales of testing, Redguard, you are tried and found wanting.
Alas, poor Orc. This was not your finest hour.
I must confess... that Nord was a disappointment.
Another one bites the dust. The Khajiit is done.
No. I'm afraid this Imperial was not the one.
The price of failure? A final fanfare for the High Elf. Farewell.
A valiant effort, Dark Elf, but take comfort. Your spirit is mine.
What a pity. For the Breton, it is over.
How sad. The Argonian was a poor thing. Let her go.
Through the gate, my Wood Elf waits! Hurry, and do not disappoint me.
Greet the war-hardened Redguard! Fight for my glory, Chosen One!
The gate is open. Go forth and greet my Chosen Orc.
This Nord is an animal... a glorious beast. Watch her teeth... she bites!
My Khajiit is quick and cunning! Go! Seek him out! See whose blood is quicker.
With his keen mind and eyes, the Imperial measures you. Give him what he seeks.
Your High Elf opponent is cool and confident. Go! Let the contest begin.
The Dark Elves are my favored people. But I am fair-minded... the outcome is in your hands.
Here you face the swift and subtle Breton. Go through the gate, Chosen, and test your fate.
Beyond this gate is my Argonian challenger. She is a clever thing, and eager for your blood.
I have opened a portal for your return to the world of men. Go now, Chosen One, and claim your prize.
The others are dust! You alone, Argonian, remain, First and Last! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Breton, remain, First and Last! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Dark Elf, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, High Elf, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Imperial, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Khajiit, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Nord, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Orc, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Redguard, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
The others are dust! You alone, Wood Elf, remain, First and Last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.
Welcome, Argonian, to the Tournament of Ten Bloods. To your right, through each of nine gates, another Chosen awaits you.
Welcome, Breton, to the Tournament of Ten Bloods. To your right, through each of nine gates, another Chosen awaits you.

Welcome, Wood Elf, to the Tournament of Ten Bloods. To your right, through each of nine gates, another Chosen awaits you.
Here you go.
You don't have enough coin to buy one.
Thank you! Let's get out of here!
Have you seen my horse? I can't leave her here!
That's fine. This one will kill you for free.
Why does this one always have to get the beggars?
Times are hard when a robber can't even make an honest living.
Actually, that's the way this one prefers it.
Easily done.
We can play it that way if you like.
Good choice.
You're smarter than you look.
Thanks. Until next time, ha ha ha.
I never thought to see a Great Welkynd Stone! As beautiful as all the old tales tell...
But of course its beauty is a mask for its deadly power, like everything crafted by the Ayleids.
Now we need only one more item, and we'll be ready to open a portal to Mankar Camoran's realm...
Yes. You did. I can't force you to do anything. I understand that. And I thank you.
You did. I can count on you.
Then I'm lucky you're here to save my skin. Come on. Let's do this.
I'm glad to have you at my back. Okay. Let's do this.
That's right. Everything depends on this. So don't screw it up.
Listen. I may not survive this. But if I don't, you must. You must recover the book and find the Amulet of Kings.
I wish I knew. They're all dead. All of them. Even my poor, sweet Biene. You... you're the one who helped her, aren't you?
You helped her pay my debt. I heard about you. She never hurt anyone! Who could have done this? What monster would do this?
It wasn't the goblins. It had to have been bandits. But, why? We have nothing! Please go. I must bury our dead.
That's what I was getting ready to ask you. You were found unconscious on the streets in Leyawiin.
Some of your Guild brothers found you and brought you to me. Good to see some of them think like we do. Now, what happened out there?
Who am I? I'm shocked you don't know.
My name is Farwil Indarys, son of Count Andel Indarys of Cheydinhal. The wounded one is Bremman Senyan. We are members of the Knights of the Thorn.
We've sworn to protect Cheydinhal from any threat, and we've entered this Oblivion gate to do just that.
Hold there! Stop fighting! I surrender! I'll give you the carving!
I understand. Accept this knowing that you have my thanks. And farewell.
This is not a gift to be taken lightly. It may cause you harm in the long run, but at least you already know a way to rid yourself of it.
Once you have the disease for several days, rest and let the effects take hold. And please, be careful. Good luck.
It seems you've been cured of vampirism yourself, so I can offer no help in that regard. I can, however, present you with a sum of money.
Thank you again. I shall rest easier now, knowing that Rona no longer suffers.
Given your present condition, the main gift I would offer is useless. I can, however, offer you a monetary reward for your troubles.
I can offer you money, of course, but given my condition, I am in a position to offer you something relatively unique.
If you wish, you can become a vampire. It will be slightly painful, but far easier on you than... other methods.
Which would you prefer?
My crown, the one Umbacano covets, belonged to the ruler of Nenalata.
I've learned of another crown, entombed with the last ruler of the rival city of Lindai.
Since Umbacano has never laid eyes on the real Crown of the Ayleids, I doubt he could tell the difference.
In any case, the other is also a real Ayleid Crown... just not the right one.
I think we could all sleep better if you brought him Lindai's crown instead of the Crown of Nenalata.
Here. I happen to have the key you'll need to enter the royal burial chamber in Lindai. I hope you'll make the right choice.
My own research into the Late Ayleid Period suggests that there was not a single Ayleid ruler, but many.
They were a bitterly divided people, with many warlords vying against each other for power.
Their ultimate demise was wrought by their own civil strife at least as much as by the rebellion of their human slaves.
You're right. Even if I persuade you, he'll send someone else, someone less amenable to reason.
But what if... what if you brought him another Ayleid Crown?
Yes. I understand. He wants an Ayleid Crown. But does it have to be my Ayleid Crown? What if you brought him... another crown?
I'm afraid I don't know for sure. I wish I had a more persuasive answer, but hear me out.
The Crown of the Ayleids which Umbacano wants is not simply an ancient work of art.
It has certain superficial magic powers, true, but its real power is hidden.
However, my studies of the ancient texts make clear that it is the key to dangerous magical powers which should be left dormant.
You may think so, in your ignorance. But I take a larger view. As a scholar of the Ayleids, I have no wish to see their evil power return.
So, Umbacano has resorted to hired thugs now?
If you think me defenseless, you may be surprised. I'm more dangerous than I look.
Perhaps you could overpower me and take the Crown. Perhaps. But I urge you to reconsider.
In the wrong hands, the Crown of the Ayleids could be very dangerous. And Umbacano is definitely the wrong hands.
Far from it. His interest in the Ayleids is not that of a mere scholar. He hopes to unlock the secrets of their magical power.
And if you know anything about Ayleid-ruled Cyrodiil, that should make you very uneasy.
I will never allow the Crown to fall into Umbacano's hands. He is far more dangerous than you realize.
Save your breath. He's the only one who knows I have it. He's tried to get it from me for years.
You are no longer one of us! Fighters Guild spy! Traitor! Your life is forfeit!
Get moving! Kill the goblins! All of them!
Very well. Scout ahead and return when it is safe.
Lead the way.
In order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata.
While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition.
Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata.
Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings.
Then why do you interrupt me? You will not find the Crown here. Begone.
Interesting... these markings are unexpected... the royal glyph is not as described by Sorcalin...
But no matter! This is clearly authentic Ayleid workmanship. Later ages have never seen the like.
To think that I hold hold the very crown that once graced the brow of the last Ayleid king...
Even to gaze upon it would have been death to anyone of the lesser races in the old days...
I thank you again for your efforts. I have one final task for you, if you are still willing to face danger on my behalf.
Ah! Magnificent! This is my greatest prize yet!
To think that I hold the very crown that once graced the brow of the last Ayleid king...
You disappoint me. I was counting on your help.
Very well. Three days, then. Don't be late.
Really? You astonish me! May I see it?
The Ayleid city of Lindai was a bitter rival to Nenalata, the city of the so-called "Last King of the Ayleids."
Umbacano may not be able to tell the difference between the Crown of Lindai and the Crown of Nenalata.
It's at least worth a try. I know I don't want to find out what terrible power Umbacano could unleash using the Crown of Nenalata.
He looks familiar...
Ah, yes. Arch-Mage Traven was quite fond of making potions in his spare time. So much so, in fact, that it became difficult for me to meet his needs.
I finally accomodated him by enchanting a very special chest for him. You'll find it in the Arch Mage's quarters.
Once a week, place a single ingredient in the chest. After twenty-four hours, you'll find a sizable quantity of the ingredient available for use.
Do be prompt in collecting them, however. Anything left in the chest for a full week will be destroyed.
And before you ask, yes this only works with ingredients. Be very careful in what you place in that chest. I can't be held responsible.
As the Arch-Mage, you are entitled to certain privileges. In addition to the full use of all Guild facilities, there is one service available to you.
Julienne Fanis has long served Arch-Mage Traven in collecting alchemical ingredients for his personal research.
As the new Arch-Mage, I'm sure she'll extend the service to you as well. At your convenience, consult her at the Lustratorium.
This is it! Just as Sorcalin described it! Follow me!
Av Auri-El ye Tamri-El dellevoy an Arpen Aran tarnabye!
Here it is... the throne of the last king of the Ayleids. And so it falls to me to begin the restoration of our ancient glory...
Av Sunna Tam Riel arctavoy an Arpen Aran malaburo!
Arise, my people! The restoration of Tam Riel begins today!
That was a bad fix and no mistake. One of the worst I've ever been in. You saved us both, my friend.
Read it, and gain knowledge of yourself. Go now. Learn, and remember.
You have served me well, and I am pleased. I give you this, the Oghma Infinium. Knowledge given by me to Xarxes is recorded within.
I give you a spell to trap these souls. Return to me when you have finished. When you do, I will further your journey on your true path.
My followers seek to perform a divination. For this, they need souls, one of each of the sentient races. You will provide these.
I see you have served my brethren, and now you come to serve me. I am Hermaeus Mora. Past, present, and future are as one to me.
Sure, sounds good. See you around.
You're a real friend of the working stiff, you know that? Maybe I'll see you there tonight, and we can drink to your generosity.
Just making conversation, buddy.
Damn straight. I can only treat myself when I'm feeling flush.
Indeed. Another mysterious visitor.
Well, go ahead. You know what you're looking for. I'll just go back to my reading.
I see. Strange visitors appearing late at night... happens all the time here.
Go on. I think you'll find what you're looking for upstairs.
He's upstairs. Go ahead.
I think he's sleeping. But it must be important... go ahead upstairs and wake him.
I would gladly let you invest in my shop! The extra coin will allow me to purchase more goods from adventurers such as yourself.
Lady's Mantle Leaves are helpful in healing wounds, whether applied directly or compounded in potions. We have plenty. Help yourself.
The Sisters of Gottlesfont gather Steel Blue Entoloma and Lady's Mantle Leaves. Take what you need, and you're welcome to gather mushrooms nearby.
Imperial Dragon armor is normally worn only by the Emperor himself. But you deserve no less, Champion.
In my capacity as Lord High Chancellor of the Elder Council, I hereby proclaim you Champion of Cyrodiil!
And, as a small token of gratitude for your service to the Empire, I have ordered a suit of Imperial Dragon armor made for you.
You have earned the highest rank possible in the Order of the Dragon, the illustrious order of Imperial knights founded by Tiber Septim himself.
It is a high honor. Only six other Champions have been awarded in the history of the Empire.
Yes. Sealed forever. Mehrunes Dagon and his ilk can never threaten Tamriel again.
Martin is dead. But he died an emperor, and a hero to rival Tiber Septim.
Then Martin is gone...
The head of the Elder Council and a trusted servant of the Empire. No one is better suited to guide us through these troubled times.
As the head of the Elder Council, High Chancellor Ocato is the de facto ruler of the Empire for the time being.
I don't envy the High Chancellor his position. It can't be easy trying to rule an empire without an emperor.
He thinks to use his position as head of the Elder Council to make himself Emperor. He will not succeed.
Chancellor Ocato has performed heroically. No one else could have held the Empire together during this crisis.
He and the rest of the Elder Council care nothing for Cyrodiil. They focus obsessively on the provinces, leaving us to fend for ourselves.
He served Emperor Uriel for many years, and so far he has done well in an impossible situation.
Chancellor Ocato isn't seeing any visitors.
This victory is not without cost. We've lost Martin Septim. What an emperor he might have made.
His sacrifice was necessary, but it leaves the Empire without an emperor.
I don't know what happens now. There are troubled times ahead for the Empire.
But now is not the time to worry about the future. Let's just give thanks that we're alive.
The joined blood of kings and gods. The Amulet of Kings. The divine power of Akatosh.
What do you mean, gone?
We saw the Temple dome explode, the avatar of Akatosh appear... that was Martin?
Here? Right here? What about, say... over there? No? Right here? All right then, you're the Grand Champion! Whatever you say!
Golly, you're the best! I'm going to follow you and watch you and worship the ground you walk on! Let's go!
Aw gee! You sure? Okay, well, I'll be hanging around the Arena grounds if you need someone to worship the ground you walk on. Bye!
You'll find your equipment in that chest over there. And here's a little something for your efforts. Maybe we'll celebrate again sometime....
A rousing success, mortal! And it appears you joined in the festivities as well. Good for you. You need to lighten up a bit.
You should probably try to be inconspicuous. Or they might kill you. Oh, and the party is by invitation only. You'll have to find a way in. Have fun!
I want you to liven it up. Use this spell on the Countess and her guests. I think it will make the party much more interesting.
The Castle Leyawiin is a dull, dreary place. The mistress is an especially somber soul, and tomorrow she will hold another excruciating dinner party.
Ah... another mortal come to beg Sanguine to add a bit of spice to an otherwise drab existence. I would have you perform a service for me.
That's fine. I'll buy elsewhere. If you change your mind, you'll know where to find me.
Excellent. Here's your payment. Come back if you find more.
That's fine. I'll find them elsewhere.
Fine. Here's your money. Let me know if you find more.
I see you have some. I'll buy them in groups of five for 100 gold. Are you selling?
I see you have some. I'll buy them in groups of five for 50 gold. Interested?
Certainly! Here you are. A nice mead will relax you.
I'd love to oblige, but we have no kitchen.
Certainly! Here you are. Shepherd's Pie... my own recipe.
Me? There's not much to say.
I was orphaned when I was young, and don't even remember who my parents were. I'm not really sad about it; it was so long ago.
Gunder took me in when I was but a teen, and I've lived there ever since. We've... shared a bed... but were never married.
He's never been cruel to me, it's just that he's never been kind. It's as if I'm just another part of his shop.
But all that's different now. I'm glad to be serving you instead. I can see we will get along just fine!
Excellent! I'll move in immediately!
Yes, I am a Speaker, a representative of the Dark Brotherhood. My voice is the voice of the Black Hand, our organization's ruling body.
One of my duties is to find exceptional individuals, such as yourself, and offer a place within our family.
Oh, very well. If you change your mind, let me know. It could prove quite lucrative for both of us.
Escaping prisoners!
Frankly, the smell gave you away. You must have stepped in... well, let's just say something that isn't pleasant.
Just be sure and keep this quiet. If the other mages even knew that I was involved with Rosentia's new guests...
I could get kicked out of the guild!
Not here. The Garden of Dareloth, on the Waterfront. Midnight. Be there.
You don't look very trustworthy. I have no idea what you are talking about.
Be patient and wait for the others. I need both the Wood Elf and the Argonian before I can begin.
Everyone is here. Let's begin. Each of you is seeking membership in the Thieves Guild.
I think we should just pack up and go home.
Oh, very well. No need to be rude.
If you want to find the Tears, I'd suggest reading a book called "Knightfall." The information inside may assist your search.
I'm afraid he and the rest of the Knights are off on a mission... a secret mission.
Perhaps if you return later, he'll be here.
We are led by Farwil Indarys. Yes, the Count's son himself.
Our job is to protect Cheydinhal from any aggressor. We are sworn to this duty and would die before letting any harm befall her.
There are seven of us here, including myself.
If you're here to join up, I'm afraid you'll have to speak with Farwil.
Hahaha! Knights of the Thorn!
A thorn in our side is more like it! Those fools are nothing but a glorified club. They've never contributed to anything useful, and never will.
From this moment forward, I renounce my life of crime forever. I am passing the Gray Cowl of the Thieves Guild to it's new guildmaster.
I guessed you would say these terrible things to me. That is why I brought my friend along.
If you try to announce yourself as Corvus, I will deny you. I will deny you before the Emperor if I have to.
You have broken my heart for a second time. I cannot let the infamous criminal mastermind, the Gray Fox become the Count of Anvil.
I've stood right next to you, and you didn't even know it. I cried out to you "Here I am! It's me, Corvus!" but you just looked at me, confused.
You mean you were unable to return?
Once I donned the cowl, no-one in all of Tamriel could recognize me. With the cowl I became the Gray Fox. Without it, I was a stranger, even to you.
Whoever wears Nocturnal's cowl shall have his name stricken from history.
Ten years ago I inherited this cowl from the former guildmaster of the Thieves Guild. I became the new guildmaster, but I also received it's curse.
Corvus! Is it really you? Ten years I've waited for word from you. Why did you hide from me?
I am also your missing husband, Corvus.
But...
I am the Gray Fox, but you have not been betrayed.
You're the Gray Fox! I've been betrayed!
That's Ysabel. She's sort of the Arena den mother. She handles the logistical stuff, as well as the training of the Grand Champion.
The Battle Matron serves as the Grand Champion's trainer and manager, among other things. Plus, I get to keep Owyn in line. Works for me.
That's Ysabel Andronicus, crabby old woman who sits over there. She's dear to me, so if you wrong her in any way, I'll rip your damn liver out.
Who is Gaiden Shinji? Are you serious?
Gaiden Shinji was the first Arena Blademaster. It was he who oversaw construction of the Arena, back in the First Era. The Arena was... his dream.
To this day, an Arena combatant lives by Shinji's credo: "The best techniques are passed on by the survivors." To be the best, learn from the best.
Ironically, Shinji himself was killed, shortly after the Arena was completed. Even he could not survive the Thirty-Year Siege of Orsinium.
The history books detail his life as a warrior for the Order of Diagna, but he was also the first Blademaster. No Shinji, no Arena. Simple as that.
The first Arena Blademaster. Best damned warrior that ever lived, served the Order of Diagna. Got killed fighting the Orcs, Azura rest his soul.
That's Owyn. He is in charge of the Arena. Arranges the fights, trains combatants, that sort of thing. Been that way since Gaiden Shinji.
Owyn likes to think he's the boss, but without me, this place would fall apart. Who orders the ointment? Who mops up the blood? Me, that's who!
That's me, genius. Down here, I'm the boss. I don't care if the Emperor's ghost is floating around. In the Bloodworks, he answers to me.
The Arena is the bloody jewel of the Imperial City. It's where all the best fighters from all over the Empire come to test their skills.
If you think you've got what it takes, go talk to Owyn, the Blademaster. You'll find him in the Bloodworks, day and night.
But stay away from Ysabel, the Battle Matron. She doesn't deal with combatants, unless they want to challenge the Grand Champion.
It's our home away from home, isn't it? I guess you could say the Blademaster and Battle Matron are our mother and father, huh? Ha ha ha ha ha!
Celia Camoran, I present to you the Elder Scroll you requested.
You're right. You're right. I can't just leave poor Menian to his fate. If he's still alive, we've got to try to save him.
Alright. Lead the way. Let's find Menian and get out of here.
The Captain is still holding the barricade? I figured I was the last one left alive.
Alright. I'll try to get out of here and let the Captain know what's going on.
The old man? Ha! He's easy to protect. Every day's the same. He vists the Coast Guard station, goes for a swim... never puts himself in harm's way.
He... He's dead. And on my watch... I've failed... Failed everyone...
Very well. Come back if you change your mind.
Hot out of the oven! Enjoy! Come back if you want more.
Please! Don't insult me! You don't have enough money to pay for my bread. Come back when you do!
Would you like to buy some of my Famous Potato Bread?
Oh my goodness! You found them! Ohhhh! I could kiss you!
As promised, I owe you a reward for your efforts. I present you with my first batch of Famous Potato Bread! More valuable than gold! Enjoy!
My potatoes are like my children. I care for and nurture each one individually. That way, they grow up to be big and strong.
Please, you must help me find them! If I don't have them for the next batch of my Famous Potato Bread, I don't know what I'll do!
How stupid I was to leave them outside all alone like that! All I wanted to do was give them some sun. Next thing I knew, they were gone!
I saw someone running off to the west, but I'm too frightened to journey into the woods alone. Please... can you help me? I'll pay you well, I swear!
You've done it! I can't even begin to thank you enough.
By the Divines, I salute you in the name of the Legion. Here is your well-earned reward.
Don't turn your back on Lonavo for a second. He wouldn't think twice about burying his blade there.
A small group of Skooma dealers led by a Dunmer named Kylius Lonavo is holed up in the Greyland Settlement just up the road.
I've been trying to catch Lonavo for months, but every time I approach the place, his lookout sees me and he goes running.
I need someone to go in there and put a stop to those fetchers. I don't care what it takes. We must get that poison they're selling off the street.
Bring me Lonavo's ring as proof he's... been dealt with... and I'll give you the bounty on him.
I'll tell you how you can help.
Kill those things. Every last one of them! They destroyed eveything I hold dear!
In their greed, the creatures grabbed a Jade Amulet off of Kayleen's... body. Bring me back that amulet, so I may use it to remember her by.
Then it's finally done. The Goblins have paid with their blood, and my wife's brutal slaying is avenged.
You risked life and limb for a cause that wasn't your own. For that, I'm grateful. Please, accept these gems as a token of my gratitude.
They're all I have left of value, but you must have them. I insist.
But... this is amazing!
I haven't tasked you to bring the amulet back to me, and yet you have. I don't know which of the Divines sent you, but I appreciate what you've done.
Those Goblins in Exhausted Mine you got this from killed my poor wife while I was away from home. Now I have my vengeance.
And now you have a reward. Please, take it. It's everything I have left of value, but it's the least I can do.
Barely a week ago, I left Harm's Folly to go buy supplies as I usually do once a month. What a fool I was to leave my wife alone.
The Goblins must have been watching me, as they knew right when to strike. I could hear Kayleen's screams from far away.
Those wretched beasts killed her! Filthy animals! Had I only been there to stop them!
Well, if you must know, I've been studying the Welkynd Stones. Yes, the aquamarine colored crystals usually native to Ayleid ruins.
It seems I'm the first to discover them growing in a natural cave. That's about all I can say about it.
Splendid... just splendid!
I'd almost feared that you'd never return. I'm glad to see I was incorrect.
As promised, I'd like to compensate you for your efforts.
You're a clever one.
I was hoping if someone came across my notes in that cave, they'd take the time to read them and trace me back to the Imperial Bridge Inn.
Being the first person to discover Welkynd Stones growing outside their natural environment, I was worried a rival researcher would snatch them.
Fortunately for me, you found them. Allow me to compensate you for the time it took you to travel here.
I was doing some research in Bramblepoint Cave, and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes.
Those notes are very important to me and represent ten years of my life. If you could recover them, I'd be sure to reward you appropriately.
I realize it's in poor taste to celebrate anyone's demise, but Raelynn was evil through-and-through. You've done the right thing.
I believe we had a contract. Here's my part.
A few months ago, that witch of a Necromancer decided to inhabit Moss Rock Cavern just north of my inn.
I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.
I've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned.
Every day, it seems the number of undead increase. If someone can get into the cave and kill Raelynn, maybe we can stem the tide.
Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity.
Gods. I don't even notice any more. I guess you can get used to anything.
I know what you're talking about. I don't even try. I just keep going until I drop.
I'm angry. I want to stay angry. That anger keeps me going.
Don't forget. Camoran Usurper burned Kvatch, too. Kvatch was rebuilt from ruins once before, and she'll do it again.
Don't give up. You're not alone. And the chapels and the Elder Council will help us. It just takes time.
It's possible. Or maybe she got out, and she's looking for you, too?
I don't know. What could we have done to deserve this?
It's about time.
My feet are killing me.
Another day, another septim.
Good. I'm hungry.
This is where the Emperor lives, when there is one. The council meets on the first floor.
The first and second floors are public. All other parts of the palace are strictly off limits.
You actually did it!
Well, I hope this will eventually drive them away. There may be a few stragglers, but I think this should do it.
Now, how about that reward I promised?
Let me see a fang.
Hmmm... good. This has to be from one of the beasts. Excellent. Soon, you'll have them on the run.
I've had attacks on my small flock of sheep lately. I was hoping that building a fence would solve the problem, but it hasn't helped at all.
Then, one day when I was just about to step outside, I saw the culprits. A group of West Weald Bears was dragging away a sheep carcass.
There's no way I can fight those ferocious beasts off on my own. If you could thin the population a bit, they would probably leave the area.
I'll tell you what. Kill six of the things, bring me their fangs as proof, and I'll reward you well. Please, you're my only hope.
Bastards. If I ever got a hold of one of them, I'd put 'em in the fire, like the old days.
I heard the same thing. I'm not sure I believe it though. I mean, who would be crazy enough to help the daedra invade Tamriel?
I just don't think about it. The Elder Council will take care of things. Sooner or later.
No. They were taken by surprise. I'm sure the Legion has everything under control.
I don't know... first the emperor and his sons murdered, now this... yet I fear that the worst is still to come.
I don't know. I hear that those Oblivion Gates are opening everywhere. They say the Legion is stretched to the limit across the Empire.
Oh. Yes, of course you're right. I shouldn't be telling stories when he could be in danger.
Our only hope is to defeat the Painted Trolls.
A gift, for me?
Oh, my. This is from Pranal, isn't it? He's such a sweet man. I do enjoy his company, but I'm afraid I just don't have romantic feelings for him.
Well, these are simply beautiful. Thank you so much. And there's no need to let him know that I know where they came from. You understand.
Ah, wonderful! I'm sure they'll make her happy. It's the least I can do; she's brought so much joy into my life, whether she knows it or not.
Thank you for indulging an old man's whims. Now, you wanted to learn something about Heavy Armor, didn't you? I think I can help.
Just give them to her; say they're from a friend. She doesn't need to know I'm the one responsible.
Ah, these look lovely. I'm sure she'll like them.
You just go give them to her. No need to let her know where they came from; it doesn't matter. So long as she's happy.
When you've got the silver pitcher and the four glasses, let me know. I can't wait to see the look on her face.
I'm no fool. I know she'd never be interested in an old man like me. It's enough just to be around her, to be in her company.
Well, if you're dead set on learning something from me, then how about you do a little something for me, first? Something for her, to be honest.
I'd like to get her a gift of a sort. Nothing terribly fancy, and something useful.... How about a nice silver pitcher, and a set of four glasses.
Here's 50 gold to cover the costs; that should be more than enough. Come see me when you've got everything, and we'll talk more.
Ah, yes. Thank you.
I see nothing has changed. How... disappointing.
Nevertheless, you have done your part. Now, if you wish to learn from me, I have much I can teach you.
I've given you the message. There's nothing more I can do.
I... J'baana was informed already.... The delays are not my fault...
Here, take this to him. It is not my fault. The job will be finished, I swear it.

What are you looking for?
Can't say I'm surprised. Few recognize the name anymore, even though he was famous. Had a book written about him, in fact!
I don't have a copy myself, but there was one in First Edition last time I was browsing there. At least some people take an interest in history.
Well, well!
So you do know a thing or two... Hazadir was my great-great grandsire's sister's-son. Bet you didn't know that!
All right. You're not hopeless. You want training, I'll train you.
A pity. I was looking forward to this. Perhaps some other time, then.
Very well. We shall speak again in three hours. Good luck to you.
Certainly. I'll unlock the door for you. Of course I have to stay with you in there.
I'll get the lock. Don't be touchin' any of them. I'll be keeping a close eye on you.
If you must. Don't try anything funny though. I'll be following you.
What a bother. Don't be too long about it. I gotta stay with you so there isn't any funny business.
I suppose I have to. Keep your hands to yourself in there. I'll be right next to you the whole time.
What for? Never mind. I don't really care. Oh, and I have to be with you. Them's the rules.
Since we don't have any Argonians, I can allow it. The Countess won't allow visitors to Argonian prisoners. I'll be watching though.
Right. Well, we'll all have to remain extra vigilant. But enough chatter. Back to our duties, eh?
It's pretty clear, isn't it? We failed once. We must not fail again. But let us discuss this no more. Come what may, the Blades will stand ready!
We must not relax our guard, not even for a second. We'll talk more about this later.
Aye, comrade, we'd best stay sharp. Who knows what tomorrow brings. As for the present, we'd best get back to our duties.
The Emperor's death was a harsh lesson to learn. We can never be too vigilant. But now is the time for action, not talk. There is work to be done.
Thank you for your courtesy, sir. If you ever need a friendly ear, I'm always available, night or day.
I... I'm glad you wanted to talk. You'll always have my sword, of course. But you have my ear as well. Anytime. As a friend.
In truth, I welcome the chance to talk. For I feel a kinship toward you I cannot explain. We are brothers, bound by duty and destiny.
Well, my friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that, hmm? We'll get through this together... as brothers.
The darkest days surely lie ahead. But I know that the Blades will stand true for the Empire, as they always have.
Only a fool would doubt the valor of the Blades, but I must ask the same of you. Do not doubt my valor, do not doubt my resolve. I will not fail you.
What concerns one of us, concerns all of us. We are Blades, after all.
You know how it is. There are whispers in the halls of Cloud Ruler, as in any other place. But it matters not. The Blades stand united!
We are one mind and one blade, of course.
You know that no matter what happens, no matter what fate befalls us, together we honor the memory of Uriel Septim.
The bond we share is unbreakable, is it not? The Blades are as one, on this and every other matter.
If I may be so bold... you are the true Dragonborn, sir, there's no one here that doubts it. Any one of us would gladly die so that you may live.
I have trained my entire life for the crisis that is now upon us. When the moment comes, I will gladly lay down my life for the Empire!
Just know, that whatever you need, we will give gladly. Our hearts, our blades, our lives if need be. Long live the Septim bloodline!
Please, there's no need to apologize. If anyone should be sorry, it's me. You're busy, and I'm distracting you from your work.
You and the other Blades have extended me every courtesy. But please, don't forget, I'm just a man. I need the company of friends, like any other.
No, my friend, it's all right. It's just that, being a Septim is much... lonelier than I could have imagined. Perhaps my father felt the same way.
Darkness may be upon us all, but the people of the Empire -- my Empire -- are worth fighting for! I just wanted you to know... I won't let you down.
Hmmm. Yes, yes, I see your point. And the others feel the same way?
There is much wisdom in your words, my friend. Have you discussed this with the others?
I've come to value your judgement, and your experience. Your wisdom does us all a great service.
We're all on edge, and for good reason. But we can't give in to panic. Let's deal with this together, as the Blades always have.
This has been a concern of mine as well. And I take it the others, they're of the same mind?
Please forgive me, sir. The others and I, we're just... well, we're glad to have you here with us, sir. We just want to make sure you're safe.
[Sigh.] Look at me, acting the paranoid fool. I apologize, my lord. I meant no disrespect. My nerves are taut as a bowstring!
I'm sorry, sir. We're all a bit jumpy. What did you need?
Thank you for your kind words. I never knew my father, but he must have been proud to call the Blades his protectors. I know I am.
No matter what happens, you must know... You must all know, that I am eternally grateful for the service you Blades have provided.
You do me too much honor. For who am I? The bastard heir of a dead Emperor.
It's the Great Hall. Those high windows -- they're not nearly as secure as they should be. If an assassin or spy should gain entrance...
It's Martin. His security, I mean. I'm just not sure we're doing enough. He is the last of the Septim line. His death would spell our doom.
I can't stop thinking about... about the Emperor. We failed. We failed because we got complacent. We got arrogant. Now the Empire's paying the price.
The Mythic Dawn. What do we really know about them? How far into the Empire have they infiltrated? They could have sympathizers... and spies.
The plane of Oblivion. We know so little about it. What if the Daedra we've seen are only the beginning? I think we should prepare for the worst.
Cloud Ruler Temple is home to the Blades, and has served us well. But I fear an assault. Mythic Dawn, Daedra... maybe both. We must be ready.
Martin is safe, and the Temple is secure. But there's a storm brewing. I can feel it... feel it in my bones. The worst is yet to come, mark my words.
The Empire has been saved, but the Septim bloodline, it's... it's broken. There is no Emperor. I can't help but feel a bit... obsolete.
Of course, sire. I just wanted to let you know you're safe here, sir. Cloud Ruler is secure, and the Blades stand ready.
Sire... we failed your father. The shame we all carry... But we will not fail you!  History will not repeat itself, of this you have my solemn vow!
Well... I just wanted to say how honored I am... How honored we all are... by your presence, I mean.
Oh, for the love of Akatosh, would everyone just please calm down! I'm fine. And I don't need anything. I just... I just wanted to talk. That's all.
Ha ha ha ha ha! Well, no one could ever accuse you Blades of being lax, I'll give you that. No, there's no need for alarm. I just wanted to talk.
No no no no... It's all right... Everything's fine. There's no cause for alarm, really. I only wanted to share a few words. With a friend.
Of course. What troubles you?
Aye, Blademaiden. What's on your mind?
Aye, Bladesman. What's on your mind?
Please, speak freely.
What do you need, comrade? My ear, my sword? Name it.
Are we not Blades, joined by battle and brotherhood? Need you even ask?
Of course, my lord. If there's anything you need, anything at all, just name it. Have you been threatened?
Yes, sire. What is it you need? You're not in danger, are you? My sword is yours!
Is everything all right, my lord? Has Cloud Ruler been breached? I told the others the Great Hall wasn't secure! Those damn high windows...
My lord? That isn't necessary. I'm just a man. Just a citizen of the Empire, trying to do his duty. Just like you.
You may have as much of my time as you need, so long as you stop calling me "lord." My name is Martin.
Please, Blade, say what you will, but let us forgo these absurd formalities. I am no "lord" yet. I would remain plain Martin for a while.
By all means. What do you need?
Well, apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner.
Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye!
The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago.
It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark. Clever, eh?
You have more? Amazing! Well, as promised, your finder's fee once again.
If I'm to buy the wine from you, you need to have it with you.
I'm at a loss for words. You actually found six!
These will hold an honored place in my collection! I don't know what else to say but thank you.
Oh! I almost forgot. Here's your finder's fee. Worth every single coin, I assure you.
I'll tell you what else I'll do since you seem so resourceful. If you find any more bottles of the wine, I'll gladly pay you well for them.
By the Divines! You found some? Fantastic!
Hang onto it for now. I must have six before I'll be truly satisfied. Then I'll have more than anyone else in Cyrodiil!
Yes actually, I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over Tamriel.
But one vintage continues to elude me; Shadowbanish Wine. How I'd love to add it to my collection.
Say, that gives me an idea. You look like the adventuring type. If you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well.
All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil.
